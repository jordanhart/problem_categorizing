I plugged it in and the camera starting surveying the area like it was getting to know the place (cute). SOOO Excited I opened the instructions and WOW what are they trying to say here? It is in such broken English that I don't know if it's telling me to do something, not do something or what anything means??? (Mommie)So, broken English is not my specialty, I'm going to have to go off the reservation hooking this up! So let me try to help:Hook camera directly to your router (it comes w/that cable). Load software on computer/laptop. If you ever get to the part where it give you 3 options to log-in, choose the 1st ONE thru IE (internet explorer). It will prompt you for user name/password. Use the default it provides by just hitting (enter). It should detect your camera and a screen that looks like a remote comes on with a window of what your camera is viewing. The bottom button is your options, click that. Go to user options and set up your own userID/password and on wireless setup put in your router info & WEP Key. That should get it done. Now my new little HooToo is set so I can scan my entire area and view my doggies activities. Picture is clear and crisp, very quiet when you movie it too. Once you get this little guy up and running you'll love your HooToo-Too  :)", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Superb capabilities for the price", "Author": "Rick", "ReviewID": "RCRUGULJJOH4J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The included software will control and display any number of cameras in a tiled window.  It will constantly monitor and record, or alarm and record on motion detection, among many options.  It will pan at a button push to 15 positions you set.  The panning control is very good, in that you can pan and tilt in tiny increments.The video is color in lighted conditions and black and white at night.  The color video quality is typical for a web cam.  The night vision is better than I expected.  The night vision works in zero light.  It is crisp black and white.  The frame rate drops in night vision mode though.  I'm getting 10 frames per second on average at 640x480 (15 is max) over WiFi G in lighted conditions, and about 4 FPS at night.  The video is equally good indoor and out.  There is an outdoor setting you must use for outside use.The audio input is pretty noisy, but you can understand someone talking.  I have not tried the audio output.The motion detection is a little slow to start recording, so it will miss a car going by, but not a person walking.You can monitor using Firefox (worst) IE with an included DirectX plug (better) or the included software (best).  When you connect with a browser, it has a smartphone option.  It works okay on my Droid X.  My computer is running MS Windows XP SP2.A good quality adjustable wall mount is included, as well as an Ethernet cable and software CD.The documentation is hilariously Engrish.  The software registration code is on a sticker on the last page of the manual.  That took awhile to find.Bottom line:  I paid $57 for mine.  The price keeps going up, as at the time of this writing the price is $68.

I connected power and connected the camera to my router so I could setup the wireless configuration. It was all pretty easy using the wizard driven software. I set up port forwarding on my router. I had everything up and running in about 10 minutes. I even dowloaded an app for my  iphone called uCamPro that displays the video from the camera perfectly. I think a lot of people that complain about these cameras are having a hard time dealing with the router settings or are expecting the camera to work out of the box. The only thing that does not work very well is the microphone and internal speaker. I havent tried connecting an external speaker yet. There is a ring around the lens you can turn to tweek the focusing.If your someone that is not used to messing with router settings and such you are going to pull out your hair getting this to work outside of you local (in your house) network.

Bolser", "ReviewID": "R1041G978DVC8J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a review back in January where I was less than thrilled with this camera.  Some things have changed to convince me to update the review.  I purchased two more camera, identical to this, but a different brand name.  The first had a lens so distorted it was unusable, the second was dead on arrival.  The people at HooToo took my review seriously, I have never seen a company in 50 years of mail ordering that was so interested in customer satisfaction.  I received a call a week or so ago and was asked what they could do to make things better.  I asked for a tech support guy to call me.  Which he did, and in about 10 minutes it was decided the camera (not so much me) was defective.  Picture quality is excellent, customer support could not be better.  I am changing this to a most positive review and would recommend this camera and company.From January 19, 2013:  I don't know how many times I gave up over the past two weeks trying to get this thing to connect wireless.  Only to try one more time.  I just managed to do it, not sure just what setting on the router or camera did the trick.  It sure was stubborn.  If it ever disconnects, I'm probably screwed.  Anyway, it can be done.  It is a nice little camera for the money and probably a bit more.  I have a long network cable, hard wired in, it works fine.  And probably not a big deal, there still needs to be a power supply cable anyway.  But it was the principal - its supposed to be wireless.  A discussion one day of the virtues of Google vs. Bing (I'm a Google fan), led me to try Bing and found much more information.  There is some free software out there called Ispy (Google it), that is amazing for setting up monitoring and actually recognizes and supports this particular camera surveillance purposes.  Much better than the factory software.  My wireless connection was done through the factory software, however.  Would I buy another one?  No way.  But it has been a learning experience.", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice for the price", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Furrykids Mom\"", "ReviewID": "R1T04WIXQB3ZTX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It was not too difficult to set up or use.

Read on . . .I bought this to be used as a baby monitor/camera.  The video monitors sold at, say Babies R Us are very expensive for what they are and are limited in function.  Here's what I did:  I bought this camera and mounted it towards the top of a 2x2 by 8 foot piece of wood with the included screws.  I went to the hardware store to get a half-dozen 1/3 inch width heavy-duty zip ties.  I strapped the 2\"x2\" to the far corner of the crib.  From there, I dropped down the power cord and also the ethernet cable.  Sure, you can use it in wireless mode, but hard-wire is more stable and I've got a network jack in my infant son's room.What you can do with this now is buy a $4 HooToo app for your iPhone/iTouch/iPad and watch your child from any where you have a connection.  It's awesome.  From work, I can just type in a link in to the *included* dyndns compatible URL and view my child from my desk at work  - when he's in the crib.This is not the high-def HooToo edition, but at 640x480, it's adequate.  In fact, you can double click on the screen and the image will expand to full screen.  I found that out by accident.  The image can get a little grainy, but look at the price.  Most of the time, my child is sleeping in his crib in the dark, so the camera switches to infrared mode and you get a well-lit black and white image.Oh, and another thing, this camera has two-way sound.  I can hear my child cry or other wise make noise by clicking on the headphone button in the web interface.  I can also talk back, by pressing the talk button.  I haven't tried that, though, since I always go to my son when he's fussy.  Note, that the audio only works when using Internet Explorer.  There is no audio when using the HooToo app (sold separately via itunes).This camera functioned properly right out of the box.  To date, I've owned it about six months and am pleased.  It does take some network knowledge to set it up properly.  You've got to know your way around your router in order to set up Upnp.  So, bottom line, if you're a tinkerer, this will bring you much joy.  If not, call your friend who knows how to fix your computer and offer pizza and beer.I did have to contact customer support via e-mail when the FAQ on the website couldn't answer my questions.  However, I was pleasantly surprised that a very knowledgeable person responded within 24 hours and will proper English.Some disappointments:  The owner's manual is printed in what must be 2 point font.  I needed a microscope in order to read it.  It was also very badly translated into English.  This camera does not offer secure https login, so be wary of logging in while you are joined to a non-secure network.  Also, this camera will NOT work with 64-bit Internet Explorer - only 32 bit.As for other positives, this can be used for other things besides a baby monitor once your child grows up.  It's got Wi-Fi.  It can be remotely panned and tilted, but no zoom.  The pan and tilt is easy via web browser or the HooToo app.  You can even set presets so that you can aim the camera at a point and then recall those position with a mouse click.Funny brand name, scattered thoughts, but recommeded!", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Terrific customer service", "Author": "spirits3250", "ReviewID": "R3AIB6JTI837Q5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was the third wifi camera I have tried and  one I am most happy with.

If you want it on the Internet you need an understanding of how to setup port forwarding on your router and dynamic DNS (included). I taught networking in a former life and had it up and running in about 5 minutes since I knew what had to be configured. Its not easy to hide so don't expect to use it as spy cam but if you just want a way to check to see what is going on when you are not at home its great. I have the home position set so the camera does not face forward and freak-out my wife or step-daughter, thinking I'm watching them, and rotate it when I want to make a quick check of the house.I'm amazed by the clarity and the night vision.

I am a stay at home mom and not a super tech savvy person, but was able to get the camera up and running wirelessly following the included instructions.

The Hootoo model not only had the lowest price and happens to be the only one offers the IO switching capability (remote-controlled relay on/off, and alarm input). The Image quality (640x480) is also better, and the night vision can see 20 feet away in pitch black. Ironically the sound is more clear than my baby monitor which is kinda funny. I havnt tried speaking to the camera yet, so I can\u2019t provide an accurate assessment on that part.I followed the quick installation guide exactly as stated in the included printed manual and the camera was up running via my wireless network in 15 minutes. Port forwarding was no problem for me as my router set it up automatically (uPnP). I have Win7 PC and Fios Router.Other thoughts: this camera has 6mm lens and it is more suited for large areas or recording an area around 8-10 yards away for business purposes. It would be awesome with its narrower field of view at pointing at doors, or even better a 8-12 yard hall way. Hootoo sells another model ht-ip210f, that has a wider view with 3.6mm lens to capture objects closer to the camera. And that is more suited for home or small room use.

Although the website doesn\u2019t look very appealing, it is very functional for the purpose of the camera. There are other supplemental software choices, such as Blue Iris, which use a very intuitive design, and give audio functionality, which the website doesn\u2019t provide, for compatible devices such as this one, but cost extra money. These supplemental pieces of software, however, do not provide full functionality that the website provides, such as horizontal, vertical patrol, and setting one of the nine preset positions. Whether you like it or not, you will need to use the website at least a few times.\u25b6 TestingI tested this to monitor my kid\u2019s play area for approximately a week straight. During this time, the camera went offline only a couple of times, and during that time, it was only for a minute or two. The picture was a little grainy and blocky, but you could clearly see the any objects or faces. I didn\u2019t end up using the tilt and pan, which I personally thought I\u2019d be using. The biggest issue I had with this camera is the microphone, as it was way too sensitive. If you would attempt to listen, you would hear blaring static noise. Ouch! It hurt my ears. If you are trying to find a similar camera as a two way audio, then I\u2019d suggest getting the HT-IP210. It may be a little more costly, but in the end you are getting better quality product. Overall, this camera completed my tests.\u25b6 Final ThoughtsIf you are needing just video, then this is probably the device for you, but if you want to hear audio then I would suggest getting the HT-IP210. Also, if you plan on using your camera for a long period of time, then I suggest getting a different IP Camera software, to supplement the features from the website. Because of the audio issues, I take off one star, and give this a 4 star rating, but I still recommend this to anyone needing an IP Camera.Pros:+ Able to be used during daytime or nighttime, with or without light.+ Includes several options such as presets, zoom in and out, and horizon patrol. These are great functional settings that optimize the camera\u2019s capabilities.+ Includes options for FTP and mail service so you can monitor your home while you are at work.+ Antenna is able to bend in 360 degree motion to give the best Wi-Fi connection.Cons:- Was not able to achieve two way audio, or even one way audio.- Camera occasionally went offline.- Software design is functional but is frustrating to use and isn\u2019t very aesthetically pleasing; it is preferred to use supplemental software, which can be an additional cost.I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Hootoo Ht-IP206P", "Author": "chinadoll", "ReviewID": "R1MDELGDWGYY5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have to say this camera works better then the outdoor hootoo cameras.

Relay works great for me.", "Author": "New father", "ReviewID": "R2VYOZJV7Z0H05", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this Hootoo model and Tenvis JPT3815W, EasyN FS-613A-M136. They all work pretty much the same way. Video qualities are equally good. Motion detection and other functions are all similar. However, Hootoo HT-206 and EasyN  FS-613A-M136 have alarm relay pins on the back. Tenvis JPT3815W does not have any (it's the least expensive among the three models for about $10 cheaper). Hootoo and EasyN have better audio (heard from my Android phone app IP Cam Viewer) that are more understandable to the remote listener. All of them have noises as expected for all such camera even for more expensive ones (e.g., Foscam). All of them can be set up the same way wirelessly or wired with my router. I tried to find a camera to control my Chamberlain garage door opener as discussed on the internet for people using Foscam cameras with relays. EasyN outputs 5 V between pin1 and pin 2 by default after booting. You can set the \"Alarm service settings\" to make it disappear after booting. However, like Foscam, during booting, it will turn on the voltage output for about 2 seconds and then off when the camera head is rotating (initializing). Some people say that this is required for linking to house alarms (I don't have). However, this will trigger the door opener. No good. Hootoo is perfect here. Its factory setting is to close pin 1 and pin 2 after reboot. (No voltage between pin 1 and pin 2.) This means if you check the resistance of the two pins using a multimeter, it reads zero ohm. This triggers door opener. You need to change it. I played with the \"Alarm service settings\" menu. It worked. (By the way, I don't use motion detection.) Now the Hootoo will not close the two pins after post power outage reboot or software hot reboot. Pin 1 and pin 2 now will only close when I use IP Cam Viewer app to do so. Now I can remotely operate my garage door and watch it open and close. In the app, you set \"pulse for garage door.\" Many garage doors are simple to control. Two wires come out of the opener main box to a wall switch. They carry ~16V voltage to power the indicator light (and motion sensor for light in some newer models) on the wall switch. When the two wires are in contact momentarily by pressing the wall switch, door opener is triggered. Wiring from the camera to the door opener is thus extremely simple. Just link two wires between the camera and the door opener box or the wall switch. By the way, for the two Hootoo and EasyN models, pin 3 and pin 4 output constant 5 V (not-controllable by software). Useful if you want to power an external speaker. Hootoo has a Reed relay with a magnet inside. I can hear the clicking sound clearly even with Android app remotely, so I know the relay is activated. EasyN has a solid-state relay without any clicking sound. I prefer the clicking sound. Warning: Remotely operating a garage door is only safe if no one else is around the garage! Don't risk it when you have others living in the home. I use it to open the door when the delivery man has a big package.Advice: After you obtain a perfectly working relay for your door opener, save your camera settings in your web interface as backup. Never activate motion detection in your web interface or Android app. Otherwise, the camera will close (constant close, not pulse close) pin 1 and pin 2 during and after a reboot (due to power flicker, etc). Your door will open during booting. You have to open up (set relay off for) the two pins using Android app or web interface. Otherwise, your wall switch won't work (even its indicator lights will be off). You can restore your backed up settings using your web interface and after this camera will work fine. In essence, never set \"Alarm on\" if you want to control your door. The IP Cam Viewer app's light-bulb icon also controls the same relay. Don't play with it because it does not have the pulse function. By the way, my Device Firmware Version is 17.37.2.41 and Device Embedded Web UI Version 20.8.1.124. Your results may be different if you have different versions. I found that Hootoo HT-IP210F camera will close pin 1 and pin 2 briefly during booting.

If you use the pan/tilt a lot, the unit will die sooner because the motors make the unit get even warmer than usual.Even with the limited lifespan, I recommend the unit for its super low cost and much better than average functionality.

Very happy with the camera. Admittedly, there are no auto-setup wizards, but if you follow the instruction manual, it's pretty easy to set up. (More on the directions in a moment.) The wifi quality is fine, and the IR night vision is very clear. Power cord appears to be just the right length. The motor for pan/tilt the camera is quiet; it only makes a clicking noise when it reaches it's limit.Things that could use improvement: First off, the instruction manual is tiny. TINY. I'm all for saving paper and saving space in the box, and it's nice to have an actual manual in the box as opposed to just a pdf on a cd, but the print of the instruction manual is so small it's almost not worth it. Second, since I'm using the camera as a baby monitor, I don't need it on all the time. It would be nice if there was a power switch on the camera. Finally, the web interface to use the camera is ok. Not great, not terrible, but ok. Since I'm using it as a baby monitor, I'm really just using an app on my iPhone to connect to the camera. If I had to rely on the web interface for more than configuration, I might be a bit more bothered by it.BTW, if you're looking for software (either a NAS or phone app) to use with this camera, this camera is compatible with settings for the Foscam FI8910W.Overall, I think this camera is a great value for the money, considering the quality of the video/audio, the features of the camera, and it's compatibility with software.", "Date": "November 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love It :)", "Author": "crystal-m", "ReviewID": "R3DBBB90ZK9RHV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had some trouble setting up the camera at first but the support team emailed a better set of directions and it is working great :) Thanks!", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for the price", "Author": "OC Birder Trish", "ReviewID": "R1WTMCYJQKFDMX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I paid a little more than the $69 they are listed at now, and am still happy.Come on, this is a $69 cam.

The instructions for setting up the camera are about as clear as mud. HooToo markets the camera as wireless; however, they must have forgotten this when putting together the instructions. Discovering the IP address of the camera can be best accomplished by making sure the camera is set on DHCP; then after discovery and setup you can easily set a static IP address. Setting up the camera for wireless use can be an exercise in futility. After I finally threw up my arms in exasperation I contacted tech support, which by the way responded timely and was very helpful. We tried several \"fixes\" to no avail. This is when we finally set the camera to DHCP from the static IP address I had assigned. This avenue also introduced a new MAC address that is not mentioned in the instructions or marked on the unit like the Ethernet MAC address. I strongly suggest you write this wireless MAC address somewhere on the camera. The software that comes with the unit for discovering the camera does an o.k. job of finding the network; after a couple of refreshes. I should also mention that if you're operating system is 64bit then you need to go to the manufacturer's site and download the appropriate software. The software could not automatically set the camera up on the network.  The clarity is very good for a camera in this price range.I use this camera to check on our children while I am on the road. The HooToo IP206 is very easy to setup on a smart phone. The camera integrated very well with the app I have installed for another IP camera. I purchased the app for two way audio, this was somewhat a waste of money, poor sound quality and the audio kills the camera's ability to pan or tilt.  Night vision works very well on this camera. I am able to view a distance of 30' and still receive a decent quality image. The only annoyance is the incessant blinking white light that indicates the camera is receiving a signal.
