{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Solid system with good image quality for a reasonable price", "Author": "almosthappy", "ReviewID": "R1HO3O0FINR2ED", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I tested out two systems from Q-SEE.  This one and the Q-See QT718-8F4-2 8-Channel 1080p SDI Surveillance DVR System with 8 HD 1080p Cameras and Pre-installed 2TB Hard Drive (Grey).  They are at very different price points - this one currently at $700 and the other currently at $2000.  Here, I will try to outline some of the differences between these systems.  Even though they are at such different price points, hopefully this will help people sort out which type of system will be best for them.Some key differences:* To start, the QT718 is a much higher quality system with with HD cameras and full HD capacity.  This make for much more precise image quality.* The QT4760 includes a 16-channel 704x480 DVR with a 1 TB hard drive, while the QT718 includes an 8-channel HD DVR with a 2 TB hard drive* The QT4760 includes 8 high resolution cameras with 100 ft of night vision.  The QT718 has 8 full 1080p HD digital cameras with 50' of night vision* The QT4760 cameras have 4.6mm lenses which have a 50-55 degree field of view, while the QT718 cameras have 3.6mm lenses which have a 60-65 degree field of view* The QT4760 has 50 ft of standard BNC cable, while the QT718 has 100 ft of shielded RG-59 cable* The QT4760 has 3 recording modes: manual, motion detection and timed.  The QT718 includes all of those modes as well as an alarm trigger mode.Both systems have cameras that are weatherproof and seem to be quite sturdy.  They both use Q-See's apps for smartphones, which are convenient and functional as well as core software that is fairly straightforward.I haven't used it yet, but Q-See does claim to have lifetime customer support, which would be very useful for anyone setting up their security system for the first time.In the long run, these two systems are appealing to different consumers.  The $700 QT4760 has a good quality picture and is probably perfectly sufficient for the average home or small business owner that wants a functional security system.  The $2000 QT718 is for someone who is concerned with having extremely high quality images and much more detailed security image records.  It also happens to be one of the cheapest HD systems available.  I found both of these systems to be solidly constructed and to work well, and either is a good choice depending on your needs.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "One Major flaw: Securely logging in remotely.", "Author": "SS", "ReviewID": "R28VDLH51GNS1B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just for full disclosure, I am an IT professional for 17 years.I bought this system early this year and, after nearly a year of usage, I figured now would be a good time to submit a review. I bought  this for indoor use, essentially a blatantly obvious nanny cam. I set up 12 cameras throughout the (my rented) apartment. The initial setup was a pain in the butt, I had to spread all 16 cams, cables, power supplies, etc. out on the floor and connect it all.  Why? because the last thing you want to do is install the entire system, snake all the cabling through and then find out something doesn't work. Specifically, the cable(s).  Thankfully everything but one cable worked fine.The recordings work well, the quality is solid, not great. The night vision is extremely sensitive, so if you don't have enough room light it will constantly pop on and off.  The physical configuration menu, using the mouse connected to the DVR is ABSOLUTELY HORRID.  Too hard to navigate to the proper menu's and no keyboard compatibility doesn't help.  BUT, the Web browser client software on the computer works GREAT.So I say:1st: Make sure all the camera's and equipment work prior to installation.2nd: Give your QSEE DVR network connection/address to your home network3rd: Once your entire camera system is connected and powered up, use your laptop/desktop to connect to the DVR and configure it from there.  Much much easier.Now, Here is my ONE MAJOR PROBLEM: When I am at work and I want to login remotely and see what my baby and the nanny are up to, the logon process is NOT SECURE.What do I mean by this?Simple, when you pay a bill online, or log into your bank account the web address has an \"https://\"  That \"S\" mean's your data is secure and encrypted.Why is this a big deal? You're ONLY OPTION is to login with \"http://\"What does this mean? it means when you log into your QSEE DVR through the internet (which means through your laptop or Iphone/ipad app) your password to access it is going through as clear as day. Anyone who snoops will see it character for character.This means, any snooper or snoopers now have access to your entire video security system.I called Q-See support and they said the \"Secure login\" is not an option and nor will it be and cited for ease of use for the reason.  And this is the case for ALL their consumer systems.To me this is a dangerous proposition. Currently, my Q-see system is not connected to the internet. I do not have remote capabilities, hence my 3-stars. But it still gives me peace of mind knowing my daughter's nanny is always being watched.Hope this helps.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Impressive Infrared Night Images", "Author": "Soccer Mom", "ReviewID": "R27ELC3Q1ZJ4E7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are looking for an all-in-one-package instant security system, this is a good way to go. It comes with 8 cameras and a DVR. Q-See makes it very easy to setup with a quick setup guide and a \"wizard\" program on the DVR. All I had to do was hookup the DVR to a standard computer monitor and I was in business. The cameras come with very long cords that connect to the DVR and to a power source (one source for each 4 cameras), so the main effort isn't getting the system up and running, but rather the more thoughtful job of figuring out where to physically put each camera and its cord. These cameras are impressive, providing good images even without much light. They automatically switch to their own infrared light source when there's not enough external light. They are weatherproof and the infrared feature means you can use them night and day even outside.The DVR comes with a mouse, and an on-screen keyboard appears whenever you need it to fill in data on the screen. A mouse click takes you from viewing all cameras images at once to selected images. The DVR is very quiet. I did not notice a hum from the hard-drive, but my son could hear one with his young ears.You could stop there and have a good system, but this one also allows you to hookup the DVR via ethernet to your network router. If you do this, you can access the images from other devices on the network, or even away from your home or business. The DVR connects best if your router is \"plug and play\" or UPnP compatible, but if not, there's a quick start guide for updating your router to open the port number that the DVR uses. All the instructions are in native English (versus poor translations) and very straight-forward.As long as you can deal with corded cameras, this is an excellent system.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Q-See QT4760-8E4-1 Surveillance System (Black/White)", "Author": "Natalie Kilpatrick", "ReviewID": "ROMKDBPUXT88", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is such a fun little system! Now, first, there's some confusion when reading the name of the item... Black/White. There's... Nothing black and white in this setup. Only grey cameras with a grey DVR with color picture.I had a lot of fun setting this system up. Everything is more or less common sense, except when it came to the power cable for me. Once I realized that each camera requires it's own power source IN ADDITION TO it's video cable, things went smoothly.If you're using this in a home application and your provider has your port 80 blocked, you're gonna have a bad time. But, if you know how to work around this with port forwarding you should be okay.The interface is VERY user friendly. Recording is instant and continuous (if the camera is reading a picture, the DVR is recording it!).There are multiple ways to view the cameras, all one one screen, one at a time while flipping through images, you can shut the displays for certain cameras off (it'll still record, you just won't see it while scrolling through cameras automatically). The only thing I wish for is a keyboard. Life would have been so much easier with a keyboard.Still a very fun system to work with and it has a great nighttime picture, but don't let the HD fool you...

I bought DVR and no cameras.I already had 8 or 9 cameras from eBay.I upgraded from a PC with security camera video capture card.I spent about an hour reading and then seutp the mouse/DVR on my monitor.Went through the simple 6 or 7 step initial setup first.Next, I got it a static ip address for my home network and found the correct port (85). I then swapped over to my laptop for rest of the configuration.You can NOT set the static ip address or DNS from the a computer on the local network, it is best done with the DVR mouse.Once I figured that out, I was good as gold.I then hooked up my cameras and configured them.  4 cameras are setup for D1 resolution and others are setup for CIF resolution.  The D1 is almost 4 times more pixels than the CIF, thus better picture (assuming your cameras will provide such a picture).  There are 2 audio ports so you can record on 2 channels.  There are 3 video ouputs (Hi-def for LCD or LED TV, computer jack for computer monitor and a BNC output).The iPhone app is neat.  Some app reviews say the new upgraded iPhone app is sad.I found that it worked great.I can also sit at my desk in the office at work and watch my house and the pets.Even with my \"lame\" internet connection.

The knowledge base is very useful and searchable.I picked this one over the Z-modo because of the price, favorable reviews and D1 option.These are the specs from 1 of the 4, D1 cameras that I have hooked up.Since I only have 4 hooked up they seem to record at D1 with a framerate of 29 FPS.I only have 4 cameras hooked up right now and the rest of my cameras will be CIF.===Recorded Video File specs===Complete File name  : C:\\Documents and Settings\\user\\Desktop\\Security DVR\\CAM04_20140223104311_928205406.aviFormat  : AVIFormat/Info  : Audio Video InterleaveFile size  : 124 MiBDuration  : 12mn 22sOverall bit rate  : 1 405 KbpsVideoID  : 0Format  : AVCFormat/Info  : Advanced Video CodecFormat profile  : Baseline@L3.0Format settings, CABAC  : NoFormat settings, ReFrames  : 1 frameCodec ID  : H264Duration  : 12mn 22sBit rate  : 1 399 KbpsWidth  : 704 pixelsHeight  : 480 pixelsDisplay aspect ratio  : 3:2Frame rate  : 29.970 fpsStandard  : NTSCColor space  : YUVChroma subsampling  : 4:2:0Bit depth  : 8 bitsScan type  : ProgressiveBits/(Pixel*Frame)  : 0.138Stream size  : 124 MiB (100%)=================================================", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Q-See brand good but this is bottom of the line.", "Author": "Wolfyjr421", "ReviewID": "R1R7M0EKOTXGYQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This DVR is a good price for an entry level turnkey solution but know what you are getting.Q-See is a decent brand of DVR / Surveillance equipment but this particular machine is the botton of it's line.  My recommendation is to spend a little more at get the next model up (QT5516-1).These are the specs directly from the manufacturer's website.  I can confirm them to be accurate.  Note that the major flaw is in the FPS (Frames per second) vs resolution.  There are two modes (CIF or D1).  You need 30 FPS / Channel to have usable video and you need a minimum resolution of 700 x 480 (with preference to be 1024 x 800).  With this model, you have to choose between the two.  The bad thing is that the live view doesn't represent what is being recorded.

However, it all works.  The other connections: USB, HDMI, ethernet and BNC, are all solid.The instructions are easy to follow. I first set up the DVR, which makes a loud beep when turned on. I used an HDMI connection to an HDTV and the menu was clear and legible. The mouse worked as it should. Initially I tried to connect to the network using a powerline router extender (the kind that you plug into an electrical outlet and it uses signals sent over the house electrical wiring) but the DVR failed to find a signal. I then connected it directly to a router and that worked. The instructions do say to connect it directly as it might not work using an intermediary between the DVR and router. Setup using the onscreen menus was easy.The cameras are sturdy and connect solidly to the DVR and the power brick. Each brick comes with a 4-way power splitter; i.e., you can connect up to 4 cameras to one power brick.  Each camera also comes with a very long cord. I would prefer wireless in order to not have wires running all over the place but for the price of the set, I can't complain.Once connected, the pictures from the cameras were fine. Colors were good and there was also good detail so you can really see what is going on.For my purposes I am not using internet monitoring so I can't comment on that feature of this system.
