I don't believe it's a genuine Foscam - it appears to be a knockoff, though a pretty decent one.  The 24 IR lamps light up the evening like it's daytime - I can see my entire front yard & driveway perfectly clear at night.  The only problem is I can't see any way to turn the IR lights off, and they don't shut off automatically during the day.  This results in a very strange picture during the day - still of high quality and sharpness, but it looks like something from another planet with green and purple colors (though mostly black & white), and my green plants look like snow.  This may not bother you if you're just using it for security, but be aware that you won't be seeing in color during the day. This is a huge oversight on this camera, which may or may not be related to the fact that it's not a genuine Foscam.  I'm going to return this camera and pay $15 more for the genuine one which actually says in the description that it has \"auto IR lamps\", and hope that fixes it.

The wide angle lens is a must, make sure to find one with the 3.6mm lens. It will give you a 67 degree field of view versus the normal 22 degree.  I have had these on the roof for a few weeks now and the wireless network has been fine and worked well.  Make sure to test your settings after setup indoor before you install it just to make sure it's configured correctly before you make it less accessible!

They will send you a new one.\"The problem is, I contacted Amazon; and found that they CANNOT just \"send you a new one.\"Because the product is shipped via third party vendor (i.e: Foscam), they do not provide warranty replacement (by contract);all they can do is refund your money.

This will often freak out surveillance programs like BlueIris or Zoneminder.  There is a workaround for zoneminder (specify the resolution in the camera URL), but at this point I am a little tired of doing half a dozen \"tricks\" just to keep the camera running. Do yourself a favor and save up the extra $ to buy a better camera. One reliable camera is worth more than 2-3 cheap, unreliable cameras.Original review:While I am pleased with the features that come with the camera for the price(wireless, IR with automatic lens filter, etc), I am experiencing several of the issues that others around the internet have encountered regarding quality control.I have the camera connected wirelessly to a new router (latest Actiontec router from Verizon). I use Zoneminder to capture the camera footage and manage motion capture. The camera itself just acts as a \"dumb\" network camera over wireless.For the first few days, I didn't seem to have any issues- until I looked at my zoneminder logs and saw that the camera was dropping out of contact for long periods of time. Sometimes the camera simply stops displaying video, and must be manually power-cycled to fix. I am going to try connecting the camera to the network using a wired connection, to see if the wireless card is the issue.There are other reports online about how recent batches of foscam cameras were locking up and crashing when exposed to very detailed images, due to using different image processors. See this thread:[...]Long story short, I would be wary about purchasing another one of these for a while due to quality control issues. This is unfortunate, because most of the IP surveillance brands in this price range are actually made by Foscam, and are just re-branded (hint: if a different brand camera looks the same as these preview pics, it is probably a Foscam clone).", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hit and miss, mostly miss...

(Just send it back no fuss)Pros:- All the cameras fired up and worked pretty good. (Nice image quality etc.)- Built much better than the tenvis stuff I have used.- Came with a mount. (Nothing to write home about)- Power supply (although still cheesy) was better than tenvis. (Heavier wire gauge...).Cons:- Wifi Range is short and varied between cameras.  I could not get more than 15ft without signal issues on some of them even though my phone and laptop showed 3 of 4 bars.  But one of them worked fine at ranges ~20ft.2 weeks later the joy has faded...- All but one is flaking out and rebooting it self without warning.  ** It does the same wired or wireless, DHCP(reserved addressing) or Fix IP, inside or outside.  ** it seems like the chipset must get hot and start going crazy.(Disconnect one for 19 min and it will run for a while then go crazy again)- One power supply died.

Looking out the window on early morning light the FI8910W shows me a lot at an hour when this product shows near total blackness.

I ordered two of these, and ended up returning both because they simply don't work outside when the outdoor temp is >70 degrees F. Both cameras started sending garbled images (portions of the image out of place or scrambled), corrupted images (images that can't be opened at all), and psychedelic green/purple images when the temperature outside warms up. These garbled/psychedelic images appeared both in the camera's built-in viewing website and in email/FTP motion detection alerts. Eventually the cameras would simply drop off the network until the outdoor temperature cooled down at night.I had these cameras connected using a Cat 6 Ethernet cable - not wifi. I tried connecting to two different routers, tried different Ethernet cables, and different electrical outlets. I tested the electricity from my outdoor outlet and from the power brick that came with the camera - they were all fine. I tried storing the power brick and other connections in a water-resistant container with a desiccant pack to buffer against humidity fluctuations and prevent condensation. Nothing made any difference. The cameras worked fine when left inside, but as soon as they were mounted outside, they would drop out mid-day when the temperature increased above 70F. These cameras were NOT mounted in direct sunlight. Maybe I just got two lemons, but at this point I think I'm done trying.

My rating just dropped to one star!  yes, these cameras hoovers in a major way! One has totally stopped working and the other one keeps loosing it's network connection and I am talking wired via a cat 6 Ethernet cable. And when it does work, the video changes to something one would expect if on drugs!  It's like a polarized negative of the image! I'm fixing to call Foscam and ask for a total refund.****************************************************************************************Update: My Wi-Fi/Ethernet problems seem to be not from the cam but from my choice of location in mounting the camera.  Yes, while it was the same distance as my other camera from the router, there was a little product that I didn't think mattered. The Power supply and meter to my home. Obviously, they have a HUGE affect on not only wireless but also wired connections! I was about ready to call Amazon and ask for a refund when I decided to move it away from the meter. Low and behold, the connection returned.  I suspect that if I had a shielded Ethernet cable this would probably not be an issue, but needless to say, it was my power connection/meter causing my connection problems. I only write this as I hope it will help solve other's problems with an outside camera. Don't do as I did and automatically blame the product.  But, the Wi-Fi antenna is a piece of crap! I broke one off just trying to attach it to the cam. Also, the mounting hardware is a piece of junk. Foscam, cut the price of the cam by eliminating both and allow us to purchase them separately, as we will have to do anyway.********************************************I ordered two, so this review is for both.First, the cameras seem to be of a sturdy construction.  while setting them up, I compared them to my other Foscams.  I have two other models (918 and 910), so I knew what to expect from this manufacturer. Both inside and outside, this camera seems to have a much better picture than the indoor models.  Setup was the same, although one of them wanted to be a female dog and not accept my changes (static IP), but it finally took them.The IR is less than the indoor models though.  This puzzles me as one would think that an outdoor camera would need more, but I'm not an engineer.The Wi-Fi also hoovers majorly with this model. I placed one beside of my 910 model camera and it failed terrible at sending a signal. The 910 trumped with flying colors.With all this said, this is still a good camera for the price. The daylight picture makes the other short comings seem minute.Two faults that I see almost cost this rating a star but I decided against it. Fault one is the assuming that the camera will be mounted with the base down. Second, is the quality of the mounting hardware.  It's plastic! Also, hard to adjust as it's cheap quality makes it almost impossible to aim it \"precisely\".

Constant connectivity loss, wired and wireless, camera would just lock up and loose picture for hours or days until i rebooted or hard reset(button on device). The colors would also invert to all greens/purples. After a week of testing/resetting i tried emailing tech support, WASTE OF TIME. They dont log tickets so you send your initial email and someone responds within 24 hours, not a problem. Then you reply to their email and someone else may or may not know what the issue is and just loop all the way back to \"please try to reset the devise with the button\". I already stated in 2 previous emails that I had reset 2 or 3 times in a week. I got sick of it after the second personal wanted to back to step 1 so i called support. Support is offshore(india) so i was not able to understand most of what the tech was saying. In the end he told me that i needed a new camera but I needed to email replacement@foscam.us, he could not fulfill the RMA request for me I had to email them myself.

I had a few inside cameras, but had never done an outdoor install.After a car was vandalized, I wanted a camera over the driveway. For some reason, users on the SKJM forum gave this camera mixed reviews so I was nervous to try it. However, I have been completely happy with it. It has better color quality and sharpness than my older Airlink AICN500W cameras and is just as reliable.This item is under the eave of our high roof. We drilled a hole through the outer paneling of the house so the cable could go into the attic. NOTE: The cable that comes out of this camera is power, ethernet, and reset cable all in ONE. I think this is for weatherproofing purposes. This is important because when you drill a hole to put this cable into your house, you'll need to drill a pretty large hole -- like a 1\" opening or so. You can't just cut this cable and splice it inside OR take it off the camera easily. This wasn't a problem for us. We just ran the cable into the attic and then filled the rest of the hole around the cable with clear silicon.The camera plugs into a regular indoor outlet. We ran a new outlet in the garage. I see you can also buy power adapter extension cable directly from the company. See what you're more comfortable with doing.We use ours wirelessly, and it has been flawless. Image quality is good and the wireless connection has remained strong.SETUP is a bit of a pain. Not in the sense that something went wrong and I had to spend hours trying to figure something out, but more in the sense that the interface is pretty basic. If you have trouble setting an IP address, installing software that needs special configuration, or setting up port forwarding on your router, this camera will make you crazy. However, if these are do-able in your book, you'll be all set. The website for setting up wireless connection on the camera was very basic. You needed to wire directly into the camera first to set it up for wired access. Perhaps there is a utility on the CD included to do all this, but I prefer to stay away from automated setup wizards.I did all of this on my 10.8 Mac using Safari.We have had some rain and the item has continued to work just fine. It is somewhat protected by the eve of the house, but it seemed well built to deal with the elements.The body is all metal. The view angle is smaller than I expected, but I don't do a lot of work with cameras so I didn't have a good visualization of how it would work. The item is about 16\" in the air and only shows our two-car-width driveway and about 3' on either side.I tested the night vision capabilities while the item was indoors. It worked really well. Not sure how well it works outdoors, because we installed a security light right by the camera. The night vision is completely automatic -- it turns on and off on its own.

However, some of this should still be relevant.Nice camera once you figure out the setup. The thing to remember when you're verifying camera access from a browser or app is that you cannot do this while using your own LAN even if using a cell phone (if set to use WiFi).  Do this with your cell phone connected to 3G/4G.  Otherwise, use the local Static IP you set for the camera - exa: if your router base address is 10.0.0.1 and you set the camera to a static IP of 10.0.0.252, then entering 10.0.0.252 should bring up the Foscam IP Camera Tool where you can view the camera image.  Using this in an app on your pad or cell while using wireless will also work.When you set up a static IP for the camera, you also set a port like 8090, which you enter in the IP Camera settings and in your Router port forwarding setup. So from outside your local network (when you're away from home) you use the IP address that your Modem currently uses with \":8090\" tacked on.  If your IP address changes from time to time, set up the Mail Service Settings to email you so you know when it changes and then modify your app accordingly.  Good luck.BTW, Foscam tech support is very good and can get you running in a matter of minutes, but you need patience to get through to them.

He was not only a technical expert on this camera and setting them up.  But was very patient with me throughout the process.  I would recommend Foscam to anybody.

This is not a huge deal for me as I am pretty handy with electronics, but it very well mat be a deal-breaker for someone less electrically inclined.  My solution was to just buy a replacement lens - I found a genuine Foscam 3.6mm lens for less than $10 shipped on eBay.  I'm not sure how far I would've gotten in trying to return the camera and getting the correct one, but to me, the $10 was worth not having to deal with that hassle.

At the end of the installation you are supposed to reboot. After rebooting a thumbnail image of 'IP Camera Tool' appears on your screen. Double clicking this creates an empty rectangular screen supposed to be the dialog box.

The Good, I have a Synology NAS which will work with the Foscam FI8904W.  I have two Tenvis 602W which are improved clones of the Foscam in some ways and they work with the Synology if I set them as a Foscam. Tenvis uses 12VDC and the wireless signal is much stronger than Foscam. The single plus for this Foscam model is that it has a slightly wider view angle, that's all. The negative is that the technical brain for this product was a very poor designer. Foscam uses a 5VDC power source, that's fine IF the distance from the power adapter to the camera is less than 50ft. I have a 70ft distance, using 16g stranded copper, the voltage drops just enough so that during the day with natural lighting the camera works via CAT5e ok. Because the voltage is so low the wireless range is extremely short < 60', my wireless router is 70' away so I cannot use the wireless feature ether. But at night when the IR LEDs kick on it drops the voltage just low enough so that the camera shuts down, idiot engineer. If I turn on another night light in the area the unit comes back on, when the IR LEDs go off.  I will have to run 12VDC through the wire and then run it through a 5 volt regulator circuit to fix this mess.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very nice camera  for the price.", "Author": "Randy.M", "ReviewID": "R2N47AU3DMVGMH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have always said you get what you pay for and you get a good camera from foscam not the greatest but gets the job done, If you want the greatest you with have to pay about $1000.00 per camera. so for $100.00 shipped that not bad at all.I would not listen to all the bad reviews on here 90% of people just like to bash things they don't understand.I will say it does take about an hour to set it up and if you are using a modem/wireless router they don't work you need a separate router,(Linksys has worked fine for me) I don't know what all the fuss is about foscam.us offers tons of support they have a very helpful FAQ and forums section.I hope this helps you in your purchase.I will say if want remote viewing (3g/4g smartphone/ different computers out side of your router) you will need some advanced computer skills.

The setup was so easy that I didn't even open the manual nor use the install disk... I just followed hints from other reviews. First, plugged the cam into the router and opened the router's DHCP client list to find the cam's IP address.

I had the FI8908W working OK then all of a sudden the wireless quit working and it can no longer communicate wireless.  I upgraded the firmware but that did not work I am using Firmware 11.4.2.17 and web UI 2.4.8.14 and the camera works fine connected to the router  via Ethernet Cat 5 it just won't work wirelessly.  It does not detect a network when I scan for it through the set-up software.  I can't detect the camera when I scan for wireless devices.  I was using Firmware 11.14.1.46 which was original version.  It worked fine for about 3 months and then just quit working.  All of my other wireless cameras are working fine but they are Linksys.  I have also tried changing antennas with the FI8904W that didn't work either.The FI8904W is an indoor outdoor but it does not work outside because there is too much light.  I  have it in the shade but it still is too bright.  I have even used a black 12 inch (30 cm)  PVC pipe to make limit the light and that still does not work.  I can't turn down the brightness or contrast enough to really see anything.  It seems to work ok inside or at night just not outside during the daytime.I have not had very good luck with Foscam so far I hope these are problems that are easy to fix and the product is just an example of German precision.  I hope it is not poor design and a bad product.It is a horrible the German Engineering is poor.
