{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Re: the lower ratings... I don't know what the problems were, but...", "Author": "Blue Collar Buddha", "ReviewID": "RT1795790L7I5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here's the scoop:  I was rather concerned about reading the wide range of ratings on this camera, seeing that there were some one star reviews coming in, so I was fully ready to return this puppy if it didn't live up to my pretty high standards.That said, here is my experience:I have a Linksys Dual Band Wireless N Router running in a single level ranch about 50 yards from some pretty serious power lines.  On the network is a Power Mac connected via ethernet cable, and 3 laptops (a PC, an older Macbook, and a newer Macbook Pro) via wireless.  Off topic, I'm not impressed with the range on the Linksys Router, but it provides some pretty quick bandwidth in the home with two networks to connect into, so I live with it.I unboxed the WVC80N, which came with an ethernet cable, a CD, and some instructions/manual.  I followed the instructions to the letter, which instructed me to put the CD into a computer first.  I put it in the Power Mac.  The CD worked fine and opened up a set-up guide.  The set-up guide told me what to do... it detected the wireless devices on the network, then told me to plug the ethernet cable into the camera... I clicked 'next', then into the router... 'next', then plug the power in on the camera... 'next', and turn it on... 'next'... it detected the camera via the ethernet cable with no issues, and continued to lead me through the set-up... I had to create user name and password for the camera, etc., then something awesome happened.  I used to be pretty technical, but now don't like to mess with having to figure out how to make something work... I just like it to work.  So to my pleasant surprise, when I clicked 'next' this time, ALL THE ADVANCED SETTINGS that allow the camera to be seen via the internet (through secure login and password) were done AUTOMATICALLY for me while I watched.  No port mapping.  No WPA set-up.  No hassles!  Awesome!Then it led me to the TZO set-up (free for 90 days) for the service to be able to look at the camera from anywhere on the Internet any time you want.  To explain the technical side of this to non tech folks: If you have a normal DSL or cable internet service, you get what's called a \"dynamic IP address\" assigned to you from your cable company.  This IP address is a number that allows other computers to be able to find your computer whenever you ask to see something (like pulling down video from [...] or getting search results from google - it's a \"send the video to this address\" kind of thing).  But a dynamic IP address can change every time the power goes out or your modem reboots.  The internet provider just gives you another one from the ones they have laying around.  So where your IP address at your house might have been 123.456.789.123 yesterday, it could be 123.456.789.456 today.  So when you are out on the Internet looking to view your camera, you need to know what your IP address is for your house at that particular time.  Enter TZO.  TZO is an IP mapping service that has your camera send out a message to them saying \"here I am\".  Then TZO writes down that IP address (automatically) for that day and gives you an address at their site to log into ([...]), which then forwards you to your house and your camera.  The service costs $25 a year, or discounted for multiple years.  NOTE: You don't have to have this service if you have a static IP address or can figure out your dynamic IP address without this service.So I set up a TZO domain (and will probably pay the $25, because we got it to show the family what's going on in the nursery for a new baby... and it's a simple web address for the grandparents can bookmark.  FYI, the camera allows you to set-up user accounts and passwords for different users.), and here's where another magical thing happened.  I clicked on \"show video\"... and it just worked.  FROM THE INTERNET ADDRESS... IT JUST WORKED.  Amazing.  So now I started to play with and test to see what the limitations of this device are:First, we had two family members log on simultaneously to see frame rate response.  It worked at almost 30fps for three simultaneous users at maximum resolution of 640x480.  Cool.  So let's play with the settings:The camera is a smart device, and if you've ever seen your Router's set-up menus after logging into your wireless router... there's the same type of interface here inside the camera.  You can change basic settings like dynamic or specific IP address, tell it whether or not to turn the power LED on/off on the front of the camera, etc.... you can change image settings, to large, med, or small resolution, set frame rate, etc... you can add or delete login accounts and passwords (add: grandma password: grandchild for grandma to use when she clicks on your camera's web address), and you can change the settings for automatic motion detection, automatic timed recording, etc.  The camera will send you an email with still images or short 5 second video clips every time it detects a change in the camera's environment (if you want it to - fully customizable), and it works well if you set the outgoing SMTP server (google this).My experience with network response in the home with the camera on:I've seen the complaints about the camera interfering with throughput to other computers in the house, bogging down the network, etc.  I tested this camera two ways: 1) I put everything on one side of the dual band router (simulating what it would be like for a normal wireless router), then 2) I put the camera on one side of the router, and everything else on the other.  FYI, we cancelled cable/satellite as soon as Hulu started putting the good stuff online, and use that and podcasts as our sources of entertainment.  As that [...] can be a bandwidth hog (streaming hi-res digital video usually is), I fired up hulu, set the camera to it's maximum resolution and frame rates, and did some tests.First, if no one is looking at the camera, or it's not sending you an email telling you about motion, it doesn't affect bandwidth at all.When looking at the camera feed, the camera's operation with nothing else going on within the network is great.  640x480 comes through mostly 30 fps at about 1/2 second lag or less.  When you fire up hulu while the camera is running (on the same channel) is when you can start to see a difference.  Both the camera and hulu suffered a bit.  Where I usually don't have to wait for hulu to buffer, it stopped to buffer once while the camera was on the same side of the router, but mostly... it was still fine.  The camera was running at about 10fps, and I was watching a hulu show.  I was impressed.  WARNING: When I turned on motion detection and walked into the room so I could force the camera to fire off a \"motion detected\" email... both hulu and the camera ground to a halt.  I assume this is because the camera was creating media attachments and sending them off via email.So then I put the camera on the other side of the router's dual band capability, giving it some bandwidth privacy.  The camera worked great.  Hulu worked great.  I could even watch then simultaneously in two different windows.  When hulu was showing a video, the frame rate on the camera drops a little (20fps?), and lag time increases to a second or so.  But when you're not streaming digital video from the Internet or downloading some torrent, it's a top notch camera that works great.  I would highly recommend the dual band router however if you want to have fewer bandwidth issues.Image quality:It's not HD, but it's not bad either.  Digital artifacts are non-existent in proper lighting, and if any light is existent in the room at all (a night light), the low level light operation is exceptional.  The camera WILL go dark if there is no light present.  It is NOT an infrared camera, does not have IR lights, and did not pick up anything when I turned some IR lights on in the room.  But crack the door with the hallway light on, and you can see.  If you want to have the capability to check in on the cats during the day, or have the grandparents watch while you feed/change/play with the baby, this will be a great camera for that.  Color is good.  Clarity is good.  I can even watch it on my iPhone.  Having see what the rest of the market has to offer, and with as hit or miss as Linksys has become now-a-days, I gotta give this camera 4.5 stars.", "Date": "January 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good but not without flaws", "Author": "Tom Servo", "ReviewID": "R2TIXBJKYO1WQC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Linksys WVC80N cam review:Positives:Supports 640x480 resolution at up to 30FPS. Don't buy an ip cam that doesn't support 640x480 (i.e. some of the Panasonic ones)The low light level performance is good. This cam claims to have a better CMOS sensor that the previous model but it's still not all that great in low light (if you want good images in low light you need an IP cam with a CCD sensor but this adds cost and complexity). This is not a Day/Night cam that has infrared LEDs that provide illumination in completely dark areas. (You need to have some level of lighting, and the more the better). Still, I think it's better in low light that some other IP cams.Cam supports wired Ethernet AND 802.11n (Draft) WiFi. 802.11n is better for supporting multiple cameras (but see negative below).Works very well with (3rd party) BlueIris softwareThe camera can time stamp the video with the current time/date. It can also display any text on the video (such as location etc) that you enter)The user manual PDF is very well written and goes into technical details that other manufacturers leave out (such as CGI commands to control the camera without using the web interface).Very reliable, especially with a wired connection. I run these 24/7 without having to periodically reset cams, which is a problem that seems to plague other IP cams.Unlike some other cams this one has an integrated infrared lens filter, which means that outdoor images will have correct colors.The status page indicates the current interface in use (WiFi or Ethernet). Some other cams do not indicate what the current interface is, and this is useful info for troubleshooting/diagnostics.Negatives:There does not seem to be a way to manually focus the camera lens. If you have stuff going on more than a few feet away you will not see details!The power adapter cord is way too short! The cord SHOULD be at least 10-12 feet long. I never understand why manufacturers always give you a short cord - do they feel that you always have a power outlet where you want to place a cam?I don't like the mounting bracket. Two screws (NOT INCLUDED - why?!) must first be screwed into the mounting surface and the mounting bracket slides into the screws and held by friction or gravity (depending on mounting position). This is in contrast to other cam mounts which must be screwed down and are unremovable without tools (this one isn't). In addition it is too easy for anyone to move the cam's position by hand. Also the mount makes the cam stand out more (more noticeable). There should be a cardboard template included to make it easier to drill the mounting holes for the screws (they must be spaced apart correctly otherwise the bracket will not fit). Also the design of the mount makes it impossible for the cam to mount against a vertical surface (side of bookshelf) and show a straight level display, because the side of the cam bumps into the base of the mount.This cam is labeled as using draft 802.11n technology and features 1 internal antenna (according to the datasheet). For maximum range and speed 802.11n uses MIMO which requires multiple antennas. This may explain why the range may not be as good as it could be.The cam's web interface should feature a WiFi scan feature which also displays all detected SSIDs, channel # and % signal level (so you can get an idea of signal strength and channels in use by other routers). Trendnet WiFi IP cams have this feature and it's a VERY useful one. It's disappointing that other manufacturers don't include this feature.The image options web page allows brightness/sharpness to be set, but it doesn't display the image at the same time so you can observe changes.The webpage \"Live Video\" displays video only using MJPEG, not MPEG. Other cameras (such as Trendnet) allow selection of video type. This does not mean that the camera only supports MJPEG but that's all you can get via the default webpage).The camera is supposed to get current time by NTP protocol but this seems to be broken - the cam's status log indicates \"NTP: Failed to synchronize data & time with the NTP server\". Unlike other cams you cannot change the NTP server and it is not even displayed so I have no idea what the problem is. This could be a big deal if you are recording to a Samba server as the time&dates; will be wrong!Comments on other reviewer's problems:\"Range problems\" - WiFi connections are tricky things, in that there are many factors to consider. Interference from other routers, distance/positioning of both router/cams, router firmware, cam firmware, MIMO capabilities of both, type of walls between router & cam etc. The only constant to reliable working WiFi is experimentation - sometimes another router or cam will work better in a given situation. Wired Ethernet gives the most reliable results but isn't always convenient. If the web interface displayed signal levels it would be easier to troubleshoot wireless problems. Also this camera should have 2 antennas for MIMO support.Overall I think this is a decent camera for the price (less than one one five). However many improvements that I've listed can be made via firmware so hopefully this camera will be improved. And how about a True 802.11n MIMO version of this camera?OCT2011 UPDATE: Just wanted to say a few more things. With regards to reliability these cams are rock solid with a WIRED connection. With a WiFi connection there have been a few times that the WiFi has \"locked up\" and the cam needed to be power reset. This seems to be related to distance from the router and I have seen it on the cams using WiFi that are located furthest. Like I mentioned above it's unfortunate that there is no sort of site survey that displays signal strength etc so you could troubleshoot this.

The WVC80N is the next generation IP camera from Linksys.  It's older similar looking twin the WVC54GCA is good but had some issues that the WVC80N solves.  You can see reviews of the WVC54GCA cam at myhomeserver.The WVC80N adds Wireless N, an easier setup for Remote Viewing and best of all, direct writing to a NAS drive to record video!  This means you don't have to keep a computer running, simply setup a shared folder on your NAS/Network drive and then add in the path,username and password into the camera and that's it!  It will instantly start recording a AVI file to the drive directly that you can play in Windows Media player, etc.Remote access is also better since it is now included as an option in the CD wizard. When you setup the camera, it asks if you want to remotely view the camera.  Selecting YES will setup a custom domain name [...] and then the wizard will set a static IP on the camera and setup the DDNS at TZO and set it up in the camera.  All of this is done behind the scenes and it does all of the port forwarding and port selection automatically.  This is a big advancement in camera setups..its actually easyGreat camera, I give it a thumbs up", "Date": "October 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Working Reliably", "Author": "J. Schwab \"kemoschwabbie\"", "ReviewID": "R2UMYXU4DLX9ZE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It took me about three days to get my five cameras that I have installed at my house all dialed in.They are very reliable; the cameras work VERY well with my wireless router; the motion detection works very reliably ONCE you have set everything up correctly.Please note -- I did NOT set these cameras up using the software.  I programmed each by hooking them up on a computer that saw them at their default IP address of 192.168.1.115.My network: C-cast cable modem, Router: Apple Airport Extreme, Cameras Connected Via: Wireless NThese cameras are set up default on the 192.168.1.xxx network at 115.  If you are like me and use a different 192 network, you will need to bring up a machine on the 1.xxx network at your home to see and configure this camera.Easy errors you can avoid when you setup these cameras:  - 1.  You must click 'Apply' after EVERY modification you make in a tab.  Some of the tabs, such as the Remote access user database allow you to add members, but until you click Apply, it is NOT saved on the camera.  - 2.  When configuring your network access on each camera, I would strongly recommend that you use a static IP.  You MUST include your gateway address and your DNS address (on a home local area network segment that should be your router address).  Make sure you click Apply before going on to another tab.  - 3.  If you are on C-cast and you want the motion detection feature to work to send you an email, remember to set your SMTP (email outbound) port to 587.  Port 25 may work for about a day, but then C-cast will turn it off (web query , \"C*mc*st Port 25\" for more info on this).  - 4.  Make certain that you click Apply after making each change on a tab.You do not need to use or pay for TZO DNS.  DynDNS works just fine for me (web query DynDNS for info).  When configuring for remote access, make sure to follow these tips to avoid common errors:  - 1.  Know AND understand how port forwarding on your router works.  - 2.  Make certain the local IP Address and forwarded port for remote access is the same on both your Router and your IP camera.  On my network my first camera is on port 1024, the second on 1025, and so on.  Make sure you click 'Apply' every time you make a change to your camera's settings.  - 3.  If you are using RTSP on your camera to view on a phone or software that supports RTSP, make certain the ports are open and correspond on your router and camera.  - 4.  If you are using a lot of cameras at a location like I am, use meaningful names for your cameras and port forwarding schemes on your router.With respect to the above tips, I found a lot of VERY useful information on this camera and how to set it up at: [...].Test each camera that you add to the network.  - 1. Access the camera on your local network via your 192.168.x.x,  - 2. Access it the same and include your forwarded port in the web address; example 192.168.1.120:1024,  - 3. Access your camera outside your network using your DNS name, example: mywvc80n.homeip.net:1024 -- include your DNS name and the port in the address,Doing this in sequence will aid you in isolating any errors that you may have made in configuring your camera, your home network, your router, and your DNS settings.Lastly, if you are using G-mail to receive the motion detection message with attached video clips look in your Spam email box.  Mark these messages as NOT SPAM.  Five second video clips vary in size from about 500kb to 1Mb.  Fortunately, if you use meaningful email subject lines in the camera configuration, G-mail will organize each camera's videos into single conversations rather than a storm of repititious email traffic.My Apple Airport Extreme with these cameras have proven to be very reliable with zero down time in three days.  I believe this camera would have much higher ratings if the users were more successful in avoiding mis-steps with this camera and their network configurations.~Kemo", "Date": "January 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Unstable.

Set up a reserved IP address for it in your router. Viewing remotely (Mac, PC or iPhone) is just fine, directly through it's web server interface. IT also seems to internally detect motion just fine and e-mails the pictures O.K.What doesn't work--- Continuous access. Monitoring this camera with any kind of software running on a PC attached to your LAN makes it CRASH. I've personally tried Webcam XP and Active Webcam software products. The result is the same; after about 24 hours the camera ceases to update it's image, AND it ceases e-mailing you motion alerts. This tells me that something in the imaging firmware is hanging up. What doesn't happen is it doen't loose network (wired or WiFi) connectivity, so you can still get into it's web server interface and force a re-boot by changin the image size setting.

I bought this as a video monitor in my daughter's room so I could see into her crib at night. It was fairly easy to setup on my wifi in my house.  Once attached to my wifi network, I am able to use the web-based interface to view the picture and adjust all settings.  I am even able to view the video, live, on my blackberry browser!

Syntax is rtsp://[IP address]:[port]/[camera mobile streaming pin]I deducted one star for the following shortcomings:1) the power cord is VERY short - this is stupid.  It is barely five feet long.  This makes it difficult to properly position the camera without using an extension cord.  The adapter is reasonable in size - not a huge power brick.2) the low light performance is not great.  In my daughter's dark bedroom, it is fairly difficult to see much detail - even with a dim nightlight.  I guess I could set up an IR light to brighten things up without bothering her, but I'm sure there are cameras with better low light abilities.  That said, with a small amount of light, the picture is detailed and terrific.3) there is a very bright blue light on the front to indicate \"on\" status and flashes when connecting to the network.

The install disc did not want to work on OS 10.4.x, it did work just fine with OS 10.5.x and the install proceeded until it asked for the WiFi network password, which for security purposes is >10 digits and a mixture of alpha-numeric.  The camera setup software would not allow the entry of a password greater then 9 digits.So it was now time to contact Linksys, which was very responsive and worked to sort things out.  The first phone call only confirmed that there was a problem in the setup program.Fortunately I have a Linksys router so they were able to show me where to create the port forwarding info and that accomplished getting the camera on the network.Remote viewing on iPhone Safari, works well, but there was no sound.Even though I had enabled the microphone in the camera, there was no sound.So another couple phone calls to Linksys and another hour, to determine that only Active-X capable browsers (Internet Explorer) are able to control ALL the features of the camera, and that Mac browsers like Safari or Firefox will not.Now Linksys does say if you can access the camera using a RTSP:// URLthen you should be able to hear sound.Well, this only seems to launch Realplayer or Quicktime on my Macbook and there is still no sound.So, high marks on the Video portion of the C80, albeit set up could use some Mac specific notes and support.Also a little more description about setting up the port forwarding info, which would work with any router.I have yet to undertake the email portion of the setup, as I have spent enough time on the phone with Linksys - who are generally helpful.But I had one incredible Tech - Andrew who was spot on!!!!", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Constant lock ups", "Author": "Billy G", "ReviewID": "R1NWLGZ17NCWVU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When it is online it is an adequate camera.

During the 3 week evaluation, it worked like a champ, especially with Cam Viewer on the iPad & iPhone. So I bought 3 more for my home and 6 for my business, for a total of 10 WVC80N cameras.That was between June and October 2011. By January 2012, 8 were working properly and 2 would only work if I hard wired them with an Ethernet cable. In other words, the WiFi stopped working. Over the course of the next couple of months, one by one, all but 2 stopped working over wireless.YES - 8 cameras with dead WiFi!!!!!All told, they lasted between 6 months and 9 months before almost all of them failed. DEAD WIFI. Only 2 WVC80N cameras still work like they did when I bought them.And yes, I know how to configure them, yes, I have a technical clue and no, I did not configure either the cameras or my routers incorrectly. I tried static addresses, MAC address filtering, reserved DHCP, WPA2, WPA, WEP, no WiFi security, different routers, different physical locations, ad hoc networks - if there was a test to get these 8 cameras back online wirelessly, I tried it. And this is in 3 completely separate physical locations on 3 completely separate networks that I control.8 of them are dead. Coincidence? I think not.If you run long Ethernet cables to the cameras, they do work... but that is not why I bought them. That is not why you (the reader of this review) are thinking of buying them. I bought WiFi cameras - I received rubbish.Check Google and you will see that this is a widespread global issue that Cisco just ignores.Your mileage may vary.

Yes.  Once I got it setup it did exactly what it was setup to do, it would come back functional after power failures and operated in a dusty and generally crappy environment- Reasonably Quality?  Eh.  I set the camera up to email me 10 images when motion would occur, the images were sufficient quality to be able to read large lettering on commercial trucks, and I could /sometimes/ make out a license plate if the vehicle were parked close.  In general I have to say though that I am disappointed in the image quality considering the outstanding quality that can be had in even the cheapest point and shoot cameras these days- Wireless?  Eh.  Once it's setup it works fine... but what a pain to get it setup.  I found myself having to constantly play back/forth between hard-wire and attempting to get wi-fi until I was hitting the correct settings.  Maybe the process would be easier if I used the CD, but I didn't, I chose to setup it manually through the camera's web interface.  It supports WEP, WPA and WPA2.  I believe it only supports TKIP, so you have to be sure that your router is set for TKIP or TKIP+AES- Email Notification?  Yes!  This was probably the best feature.  I created an email account just for this camera, that setup piece was very easy (on the camera) and after defining my motion detection area (IE only, Firefox, Safari, etc do not work!) it was emailing me photos based on motion events.  Be careful w/ the motion area otherwise you may find yourself with hundreds of emails from passing cars, etc.  You might also want to define motion detection times to exclude after dark if you have no exterior lighting--my setup would get a motion trigger from every car that would drive by because their headlights would reflect on the window glass.Overall this is a decent camera, but it's really the quality that I would have expected in 2001, not 2011.

If all you want to do is just watch the camera or configure the motion sensors to email you a JPEG or video, then you would be fine without purchasing a third party software. I use this webapp on my iPhone to view the camera from there. But if you want to set up recording schedules to record video to your hard drive then you might look into purchasing one. I Feel like the $115 (including shipping) I spent was well worth it. The camera is great, and well worth the money.Pros:-Camera works very well. Its not HD quality, but it also doesn't claim to be. It does exactly what it claims to do, and does it well.-Easy setup if you have any type of networking knowledge (if you don't check out Google or YouTube and you should be fine).-Good low light visibility.-With motion detection set up, it gives the option to email you a JPEG or short video file upon motion detection. This function works very well.-Great price. Well worth the money. Although the monitoring software isn't great in my experience, there are plenty of options out there, and I think the software is really just a bonus at this price anyway.Cons:-Included monitoring software isn't up to par. In my experience it had a tendency to crash, run very slow, and be overall unreliable (on a Windows 7 PC). But for $30 you could buy Blue Iris (PC) or Evocam (Mac) and be able to run multiple cameras easily and reliably.-No zoom function (it doesn't claim to have one)-No pan or tilt function (doesn't claim to have this either).-The audio function doesn't work that well. A lot of it is probably due to my internet connection, but I don't have any use for this feature anyway.If you are looking for a good, stationary IP camera that packs a lot of features into an inexpensive package, then this would be a great choice.

The motion detection screen is really nice and has great granular control, however the recording tab is weak and only lets you choose \"Start Recording Now\", or \"Define a Recording Schedule\" which translates to start day time, and stop day and time.

Gilchrist", "ReviewID": "R1GVLR7XW8JUMF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because it seemed like a good deal for the price, and to some extent it is. Setup was easy following the step by step instructions on the card it comes with. The only issues come up when you realize that Mac functionality was probably added as an afterthought. When the Setup utility finishes, it's supposed to allow you to go into the remote access setup to stream your camera online. The instructions even depict a screen where you click\"Next\" after setup to continue there. On your Mac, however,  that button doesn't appear. I tried three Mac OSX versions, from Tiger through Snow Leopard: no button. But not to worry, the setup utility placed an alias on my desktop to access the the camera's internal server and make some adjustments that way. You launch it, and are pleasantly surprised to find you are now able to go through a browser-based menu and make changes to the image quality,  set up email alerts with photo or video attachments, and it all seems great. I was not able to test FTP uploads so I can't comment on that, but emailing images works great. I was disappointed to see the longest image series it sends is either 5 photos (one per second for 5 seconds) or 5 seconds of video, but you can set the refresh rate per event to 0 minutes and the camera is triggered then almost immediately by new motion to keep capturing the next series. I was not able to figure out continuous streaming just yet because the camera defaults to their vendor of choice for that, TZO, and you only get a free trial before paying. Since I have my own web space, I'd rather wait and see if I can stream it free somehow when I have more time, but I suspect that may be complicated. I tried and I was not able to get the camera to be selected by CamTwist to be used by a site like Ustream, and my research on line seems to indicate that you can't do it. I suspect I'll be herded into TZO's customer database sometime soon.All of this is about as good as I'd expect from a camera at this price, but there's one MAJOR flaw in the software where you adjust the camera itself; the button to adjust motion sensor sensitivity (zones, etc) simply does not work on a Mac. It launches an empty window. I tried several OS versions and several browsers including an old Explorer for Mac. No dice. My camera also doesn't seem to see even extreme \"motion\" (me flailing wildly) in stark silhouette in front of a well lit window (the exact place I bought it to monitor) or in my kitchen with very flat bright lighting, and I can't access the sensitivity settings to play with it.

Like with any WiFi camera, you better make sure you have a strong WiFi signal at the camera location. (Search and Download \"inSSIDer\" for a great free program to measure your WiFi signals.) I did return 2 units when I first received them because there is a quality control issue with the lense.  The two returned cameras had a definite blurry image in the center of the image compared to the best units.I initially replaced 4 WVC54GCA with 4 WVC80N cameras used to monitor the scenery in and around a northern Minnesota cabin.  The older cameras still worked as new, but they had limitations that have been fixed with the WVC80N.WVC80N Pros1. The WVC80N image is clearer. The older cameras are fairly clear in the center but are fuzzy toward the perimeter.2. The Motion Detection video clip recording works much better. With the older camera it was impossible to find a sensitivity setting that would get the desired clips without also getting way too many false activations - unwanted clips. I now have the cameras upload video clips by ftp:// from the cabin to a computer at our home so we can browse the video clips from any device in our home. As a security feature 1 indoor camera emails an .mp4 video clip whenever it sees something. To avoid filling up our mail-box with unwanted video clips, this camera is powered off when specific user codes have disarmed the security system.3. The .mp4 clips have amazingly fast (1/1000s or better) \"shutter speed equivalent\" for each frame.  I have video frames with a Canadian goose and another with a hawk flying in front of the camera only 10 feet away, and the birds are captured with absolutely no motion blur.4. Playback Devices:Windows 7 Computers can play the live streaming video and the emailed or ftp:// .mp4 video clips. To play the videos without the Linksys plugin (and no audio), you can download Google Chrome, because IE will only play 1 frame of the video without the plugin.Our iPad can play the streaming video but won't play the .mp4 clips because the iPad is very limited with respect to direct internet playback standards.Our Android phones can play .mp4 clips emailed by the cameras but not the live stream. The phones won't access the ftp:// or the Windows share where the motion detections clips are deposited.Reviewers have complained about the Sound - - With very fast cable internet service at each end of the connection, the sound only works across the internet with video set at 2 frames per second and the image quality set to 'low'. Otherwise the audio is broken up.  The sound pickup is very clear but with a small amount of hiss and crackle.  I don't see much difference with the low quality setting for an interior scene.5. Cold Temperature Operation - not officially recommended: I have two of these cameras under the cabin roof overhang in northern Minnesota. Last January they worked fine at -30F. (The Linksys WVC54GCA cameras worked for 3 years in these outdoor locations) I put tape over the top Vents for the winter to allow the cameras to keep a little of the heat they generate. Must remember to take the tape off in summer or they will probably overheat.6. Low light - excellent . . . MUCH better than the WVC54GCA.WVC80N Cons1. It would be much better if the ftp:// video clips could be set longer than 5 seconds.  The 5 second limit makes sense for emailed clips, but not for ftp. A 10 or 15 second clip would be much more useful.1. The color saturation of WVC80N is not as good as the older cameras. Not a big issue.2. A design defect in the new cameras . . . all 4 cameras bought at two separate times have a definite red hue in the center of the image shifting to green at the perimeter. This is VERY distracting if the image is a winter snow scene. In the summer or indoors the color gradient from center to edge is less noticeable. This color balance gradient was not present on the earlier models.Regarding Setup:You don't need the product CD to setup the cameras. When you plug the camera into your router it gets an address from the router, then connect to the built-in management web page with your browser. Its helpful to download a free IP scanner for finding devices on your home network. Recommend the \"Angry IP Scanner V2.21\". You will have to tell your anti-virus software to ignore the Angry Scanner because most anti-virus programs complain about most network scanning tools. To get this great little scanner, just search for \"download ipscan.exe 2.21\". DO NOT GET THE NEW BETA VERSION ON THIS SAME DOWNLOAD PAGE.Regarding Dynamic DNS:If you have multiple cameras or locations you may prefer a \"professional\" alternative to TZO; register your own domain name at DotYou.com ($10.00/yr) which includes DNS servers that support Dynamic DNS. Then download and buy ($25) the best Dynamic DNS software \"DirectUpdate\" to update your IP address on the DNS servers at DotYou. (DotYou.com DNS servers and \"DirectUpdate\" software are compatable) You can try before you buy DirectUpdate.Overall: These are great cameras for the price.

Varley", "ReviewID": "R3I4MZXQ8PU2NR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This would be a great product if it worked as advertised. It doesn't work with Windows 8.1 (and I presume 8.0 which has been out for a year and a half now). I'm a web developer in my day job and so am very comfortable with computers though I don't know a lot about the details of networking.The product comes with a CD and as installation proceeds there are fancy animations showing where to plug in the power cable and so on which anyone could have followed with a simple diagram. However, then it abruptly stopped saying it had \"error 107\" but gave me no clue as to what to do about it. The Help is useless and clearly outdated making references to Internet Explorer 5.5 and - wait for it - Netscape Navigator! After searching around the internet it appeared that the problem was that my wireless router was using WEP encryption and after resetting it to use WAPv2 the installation continued to completion.That didn't mean that it worked though. There are actually two ways to control the camera, either through the installed software, or through a web-based interface. Using the latter I could see the video feed from the camera but getting it to record something when motion is detected requires you to be running an FTP server, or getting it to send an email with a video file attached. I tried to download and install Filezilla and then XLite but I couldn't figure them out. Despite copying and pasting the SMTP server name and port from my email client, I couldn't get it to send emails either.So back to the installed software which wouldn't show the video feed. I eventually gave in and called Customer Service who were excellent and I wish I could give them a separate rating. I expected a long wait on hold but the call was answered almost immediately. The person I spoke with said this product goes straight to Tier 2 level or something and after a short delay she transferred me to Holly who clearly knew her stuff. I told her the problem, she asked me a few questions and then I asked if it wasn't possible for her to share the screen with her. She said yes but it costs $9.99 which was OK with me. Holly appeared to have instructions to keep going as long as necessary as I was on the phone with her and screen sharing for over 90 minutes. She was able to verify that the installed software was not showing the video and nor was the email working. That didn't take long before she asked if I had another computer I could install it on. I do but it runs Windows XP which Microsoft finally cut adrift earlier this month and a giant security problem. I was planning to put Linux on it since I now consider it unsafe but lacking any alternative, I installed the software and it works!!! There are a few odd things: first having recorded some video, it doesn't populate a list of videos which is what the middle panel is for; second, it records in .sef format and you have to change to change the file extension.avi for anything to play it (the DOS command ren *.sef *.avi is your friend here).I did get a popup on the Windows 8 computer (from the router I guess) saying there was a conflict with two devices trying to use the same IP address and we found the tablet couldn't connect to the wifi. Restarting the router fixed that. The installed software has lost contact with the camera a few times though the feed is still visible over the web interface so I'm not sure what is going on there but forcing it to refresh but making a settings change and changing it back seems to work.I bought two cameras, one for the front of the house and one for the back but returned the second one as I'm less concerned about the front and this camera is really too much trouble. One of the reasons I bought it was I had a high opinion of Cisco products and the hardware looks well made but rather than paying the excellent customer service staff, it would be better if they updated the software, not just the minimum of fixing the Windows 8 problem but updating the look and feel which feels so old and better handling situations where things go wrong like error 107.Oh, one more thing, to managed the camera remotely (not important for me), you need a fixed IP address which means you need the services of a company like TZO to keep track of the dynamic IP address your internet service provider gives you. The software knows about TZO but unfortunately TZO was taken over by another company and setting that up failed. If you go to the company's web site there is a prominent link for Cisco customers and you think you are OK but then it says you have to do it from the CD which doesn't work. Somewhere I saw a \"Learn more\" link which pointed to go.purenetworks.com but that no longer exists. So again, the SOFTWARE NEEDS UPDATING. I suspect most customers don't have the patience that Holly and I did and just send back the opened, unsaleable box.", "Date": "April 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Problem Solved!", "Author": "Joselito Q.

If you have some basic understanding of home networks setup is rather straightforward. I had the camera unboxed and installed in under 10 minutes. I am a Linux user so I cannot comment on the installation cd, but in my it my opinion it is not needed.  I read alot of comments on wireless issues but people must understand that wireless and throughput issues are largely a function of your router, not the camera. I have this coupled with an e4200 linksys router so disconnects and throughput issues are non-existent.Low light sensitivity is very good however the motion detector doesn't seem to work as well in low light conditions. Video quality is satisfactory but not excellent. However, I did not purchase this camera to watch my front door in 1080p.For those of you having difficulty setting up the motion detector email functionality use port 587 as your smtp port and you will have no issues.I cannot give the camera 5 stars as there is one severe issue with this product. Some important parameters for the motion detector require Active X to tweak them. This means you are required to use Internet Explorer only. For a Linux user like myself (or Chrome, Firefox users) this means when you want to change the motion detector sensitivity and you have to go hunting for a PC with Internet Explorer. Why these features could not have been coded into the firmware like the rest of the settings is beyond me. The days of Internet Explorer dominance are over, Linksys/Cisco really should offer support for other browsers.

A neophyte has NO CHANCE of setting this up correctly.First, I had to figure our how to forward the ports (1024 and 5000) for a new router (ASUS RT-N56) I installed a few months ago (replacing a Linksys router).  It wasn't hard to figure out the IP address of the camera, but the setup program for the ASUS router had a drop down for the IP address in the port forwarding tab that didn't include the camera IP.  Finally figured our I could just type the IP address into the field (what a dummy).It wasn't too hard to figure out how to make the camera IP static.  Then, I got a stable IP address from [...]([...]) to solve the dynamic IP address assigned by Comcast.net.  Voila...my camera finally shows up on the internet (at last....).Then, it took another night to get the email notification to work. When I tested my setup (test email button), all i got a failure.  After much research, I discovered you had to enter the SMTP address of the outgoing mail server for Comcast (not Hotmail or my own mail server on my domain).  When I set the outgoing server to [...], sure enought the email worked, and so did the motion detector.I still need to get the camera to record to my NAS server, but after all the above how hard can that be???

I've had lots of linksys products in the past, and currently have a linksys router, so I was most confident that this camera would be good.  The first camera, which I bought on Amazon, was unable to connect to my wireless network.  The installation CD was useless, and essentially started returning a bunch of errors.  I tried to set it up manually, since I've become fluent in how these things work thanks to my nanny-cam network, but it just wouldn't find my network.

They spent two hours trying everything under the sun to get the camera to work, and in the end admitted that it wasn't the settings or the network, that the camera's wireless function was not working.

I inserted the disk, followed the directions and was up and running in minutes.  The only thing that slowed the process down for me is I never remember my router password.  So after resetting my router, setting up my network again and creating a new password, I completed the configuration process.  Once that was done, I was quickly able to view the camera via the software console, web console and even safari browser from my iPhone.Viewing online has been nice with plenty of basic settings (image size, quality, framerate, recording settings, etc) editable on-demand.  The image quality is better than I expected both in light and in low light.  It is also nice that the camera is fully functional without a computer turned on at my house.

Should any issues/problems come up, I will update this review.  For now though, I couldn't be happier with my purchase at this price point.  As a side note, I considered other more expensive models (primarily Logitech Alert 750i Indoor Master - HD-quality Security System(961-000329)) but decided that was more functionality and too pricey for my needs.I had to come back and update my rating to 4 stars because I had trouble getting the recording working.

It sets up everything with the step-by-step installer. It will even configure many routers (DLink and Cisco/Linksys types) automatically for you with only having to enter the admin credentials for the router. Overall the ease of setup makes this one of the best cameras for a simple do-it-yourself setup.The software is really great too. Has dozens of simple options for recordings and such but you will want to have a lot of free drive space on the local drive where the software is installed to. It even has a security-timeline that shows you at a glance where motions events were recorded if you set it up that way. Overall the software is top notch.As for the features of the camera hardware...well the image quality is really great and it can handle moderately low light but not dark or nighttime. No IR LEDs for night vision which many other cameras I have used have for around the same price. No pan/tilt so getting the camera pointed where you want is difficult. It picked up a lot of interference on the audio side only and I was unable to resolve that issue. Other cameras I have gotten since do not have this issue.For the price it should have more hardware features but it makes up for some of that with the software.

You may be led to believe you can also monitor the sound.  Yes, but only in Internet Explorer.The software - uggh!Incomplete - not much feedback on whether what you did worked, if you have issues, there is a Status screen that shows geeky IP stuff, not useful info like camera wireless signal strength, or other clues that might help understanding why there are issues.  But like I said, if you are a geek, go to appendix D and see the cgi routines which you can use, but REALLY should be used by their own GUI, IMO.Nice feature to send an email when it detects motion.

Everything you just typed in is GONE!As noted elsewhere, settings do not always stick, and I needed to apply 3-4 times to get what I wanted.Motion detection - if you use video, you can record up to 4 seconds leading up to the trigger.  Better than the Lorex system, that usually triggered when subject was off screen, but 4 seconds may not be enough.  And post recording is only 1 second?  Not sounding real useful to see 5 seconds of stuff - probably not enough to get a good look at the face shot of the guy robbing your place blind.If you ALSO turn on the function to ALWAYS record and then use motion detection to look up the full video, that could work, but - I have yet to get THAT to work.Camera is an indoor camera, and can not see in the dark.$25 a year to view on the internet.

One died and was out of warranty so I bought a new one which has been running for a couple of months.  The third one was defective out of the box.  It would not retain its configuration across a power cycle.  Overall, I'd expect a better level of quality from Cisco.As others have mentioned, one weak point of the design is the length of the AC power cord.  This limits your location.  Also, I have used the wireless capability and it's not 100% rock solid for the connection.  This is not an issue if the device is conveniently located in your house where you can power cycle it if it locks up.  However, for a remote location this becomes problematic.  Some people put these devices on a timer to power cycle them once a day.It's better to use the wired vs. wireless connection on this camera, again for more reliability.The camera mount does not allow a 90 degree tilt of the camera with respect to the wall due to the bulky camera body hitting the wall.Security-wise, the connection to the camera uses http not https, so the video data is not encrypted.  Neither is the userid and password that you use to login.  Those hackers who stumble upon the camera's IP address will get a display telling them the name and brand of the camera.

The resolution of the image is sufficient for an overall view but not for identifying people's faces for police purposes, for example.Configuration-wise, I'd recommend getting a computer-savvy friend to set this up.  Change the administrator login and add another user login for video viewing purposes not related to administration.  I'd recommend using a wired connection and static IP vs. dynamic.  If setup for dynamic IP (DHCP), the unit will attempt for a minute or so to get an IP address from your router, and if it fails it will stop trying and assign its own static IP which may not be compatible with your router's IP addressing scheme (taking your camera off the air and requiring a site visit to power cycle).These units do work very well with home powerline Ethernet bridges, which can help in those cases where running the Ethernet cable back to the home router is impractical.", "Date": "August 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "GrumpyOldFart", "ReviewID": "R2KUCP9GWKT7YS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This indoor wireless camera is the best one that I have purchased.

When care-givers make routine bed checks at night, these cameras record the activity and then send a verifying emails with a short video clip. Since these cameras only only fair in low light conditions, I use motion detecting lamps for night-time service.The solution also allows live monitoring - useful to spot check on care or a parent. Because I travel a lot, I use either an iPhone 5 or iPad for this occasional real-time monitoring. Though the webcams are supposedly browser friendly using the TZO DDNS service, I use uLinksys by [...] as a viewing tool. It costs $3.99 and another $2.99 in app purchase for multi-camera use.

TZO had spotty customer support in the past but is much better now that it's owned by Dyn.[...]In addition, these cameras will not work well with Apple Routers without difficult port forwarding work that I wanted to avoid.

After receiving the camera I downloaded the setup from manufacturers website. The camera worked perfect through my browser when connected to my Asus router by the RJ-45 (Ethernet) port. No further set-up was required to view this on the LAN (Local Area Network). I then installed the manufacturer software for the increased functionality. To get the wireless to work can be a bit of a problem. The easiest way I found was through the use of the WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Set-up) Switch on both the camera and my router. Once I pushed the WPS switch on the camera then on the router I had no further problems. If I turn camera or router off they reset perfectly once power is restored. I did not have to subscribe to the web monitoring service as I only wanted to use this on my LAN. My suggestions for this is if you want an easy wireless set-up with this camera make sure your router has the WPS switch before you order the camera. It may be easy to set-up otherwise but with this switch you should not have to find out.The camera has extremely good quality video and images for an IP camera in this price range. The zoom quality with the manufacturer software leaves something to be desired as it is digital zoom only, which pixilates and distorts in relation to the zoom used.

Mostly I want this review to help everyone having problems with the e-mail notification and remote veiwing.1) Remote viewing  What you need is really a ROUTER that supports both DDNS (DynDNS) ,Single Port Forwarding, and DHCP reservation. The Linksys E3000 and above does, so that's easy. Use DynDNS.org, not the TZO that comes on the camera. Set the router to DHCP reserve whatever IP you want for the camera(s). Then setup SINGLE port forwarding for whatever unassigned port you want to goto that address (e.g. 47152 --> 192.168.1.3). If you have more than one camera setup more ports to their addresses. Open the DynDNS.org account and choose the hostname option. Follow all the prompts, make your account and put that info in the router. You should get confirmation of success. Then just use a browser and goto [...]# (ex: [...]:47152). You will get the normal web interface for the camera like you were on your home network and typed the IP.  Also a great app for viewing on Android and iOS is IP Cam Viewer. The developer updates regularly and recently added audio support for this camera on Android and iOS.2) E-mail alerts  Goto lavabit.com and setup a basic account (128MB). You won't be keeping anything on this account so you don't need the space. Use their SMTP settings and your new account info and put that into the camera web interface. Direct the e-mail to your real e-mail, and show it from the lavabit.com one you just made. SSL is off by default for lavabit.com, so as long as you don't turn it on, the camera can send from that SMTP server.If anyone wants me to clarify on this review just comment and I'll get an e-mail alert.

Initial setup requires connecting the camera directly to the router. I found myself constantly moving back and forth from the router and camera (in one room) to the computer (in another room). At the very end on the 1st try, it failed to recognize the camera causing me to do everything a 2nd time. I have the luxury of being somewhat familiar with computers and networking which proved useful because the camera also requires doing some port forwarding among other actions in the router.Operation: Signed for TZO trial. Tried numerous times to get website to appear with no luck. Ended up having to copy and paste the web address from the notepad file it creates to actually get the site to appear. Not sure what the difference was between what I typed and pasted but anyway. To see if it was user error, I had my mother (in another location) try and the same thing happened: no luck when typed but works when pasted. Using a computer from within the home (and same network), the video feed would show. Video feed would also show on my mothers computer. However, when I tried at work, there's no feed (assuming due to firewall). While this is not necessarily the camera's fault, it does me no good to have it if I can't see it while I'm at work. On the otherhand, video viewing is supposed to be available on smartphones. Using my Blackberry Curve 8530, I initially couldn't get anything at all use the address. Then I found out it needs to be RTSP instead of the normal HTTP at the beginning. With RTSP, I looked as if the video might finally play but instead gave an error message. For a week, I searched the internet for a resolution and could not find one that worked. So now that I can't view it at work or on my smartphone, there's absolutely no need for me keep this.Also, there's secondary software (included on installation disc) that you can install to your desktop/pc. It allows for in-home camera monitoring capable of displaying several views at once if you have additional cameras. There are actually two configurations (when to record, how to handle motion detection, etc.) between the website configuration page and desktop configuration to which I found out the hard way, work independently of one another. Maybe this is my ignorance but I didn't know that in order for the camera to record if setup on the desktop config, the computer has to be on. I didn't think an ON-computer would matter since it's a wireless network cam but I was wrong. To save recording setup from website config, you need establish an online location and path for the recordings to go. Not sure how many of you already have this but this was another unplanned step that I wasn't willing to make.Quality: The picture was a picture. Not bad but not bursting with clarity either. The more light, the better the view.Conclusion: If you just want to view your home while you're at home, this is good. If you want to view it from residential home networks, this is good. If you want to view anywhere else, good luck! Most companies have firewalls and unless you work in that companies IT dept., is hard hard to know if you'll be able to see it or not. This makes me wonder if I would have the same problem out-of-town where I'd be using the hotel's WiFi. Would it show or be blocked again? Majority of cell phone users have smartphones nowadays (Blackberry, Droid, iPhone, etc.). Which ones actually work with this device, who knows. My blackberry is RTSP capable and its software has the latest v5.0 so go figure.

The set-up seems easy enough, but what they don't tell you is that it only really works well wirelessly if your router is a LINKSYS product as well, which of course, ours is not.  The tech \"support\" is only available from 8 to 5 Eastern time, (we live on the WEST coast) and only Monday thru Friday!  There is no actual free tech support, as they charge you $19.95 for that.  I was forced to pay that initially when the \"hosted\" domain name would not work, and after paying the $19.95, had to undo everything the tech did. I was able to do some imaginative as well as lucky tweaking, and got it to work.  Unfortunately, after the initial 90 day free trial period of the domain hosting is over, the remote function ceases to work.  I logged back on today to sign up to pay for the TZO hosting of my domain name to access the camera remotely, and again...it does not work!  And now I am on the hook for a year's worth of hosting for an apparently non-existent domain name.The ONLY pro to this waste of money is that when you can actually get it to work remotely, the picture quality is surprisingly good, as well as the audio.", "Date": "April 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "can't comment on the product, only know that UCBerkeleyVillage won't ship for over 2 weeks!!!!!", "Author": "Joanna57 \"joanna57\"", "ReviewID": "R2DNJBEYHX5R9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was so excited to get this camera - very disappointed to find UCBerkeleyVillage makes you wait over 2 weeks to just SHIP the item (I ordered on the 15th May, they say they will only ship it OUT first week of June - why the delay?) - and when I queried it, they didn't give any explanation, just that this is their shipping practice, that is how they listed it (which I hadn't noticed or else I wouldn't have bought it.)  I probably should have spent more time reading the listing, but all I know is a friend recommended the camera, sent me a link to the item on amazon.com, and I purchased the least expensive one without reading up about the seller or the item - never expecting to have a problem because I know how strict Amazon is about their sellers - they normally only want the best, most professional sellers on their websites.  Anyway, I did tell them I thought it was misleading to have on their INVOICE that they ship within two business days when they obviously won't ship until first week of June - their response - they canceled my order and a rude note saying they never mislead their customers.  I was hoping to be up and running at the beginning of June, not waiting for the first week of June for them to just ship the product!!!  If they had been nice about it, I would have said ok, no problem, I will wait, but they were rude - so I will go elsewhere.

This will be the last and final time I ever purchase a POS linksys product ever again! Linksys is garbage!Also wanted to add, if you plan on adding more then pone camera, better have a dual band router handy, i opted to go out and purchase more ethernet cables, but that still didn't stop the cameras from giving me problems. Maybe Belkin will come out with ip cameras in the near future, I simply do not trust linksys for any of their products they sell. I once had a router by them which gave me problems, winded up stomping a mud hole in it and walking it dry.
