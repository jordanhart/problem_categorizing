That said, these CG45/CG45W cameras are importantly, fully-compatible with the FHSS (Frequency-hopping spread spectrum) G755 system (unlike other older, less costly non-FHSS Uniden RF cameras).The two cameras that come with the G755 system are pre-paired for you at the factory but you will have to pair any supplementary cameras to your system yourself - no big deal. From pairing camera screen, tap image 3 or 4 (1& 2 are pre-paired as mentioned earlier), then during 60 second count down, press the pairing button on the new un-paired camera. Repeat for the fourth camera as applicable.Amazon note: The only reason we rated this as a four (4) vice five (5) is that Amazon restricts the purchase quantity on some items. We had two G755 systems and needed a total of four (4) supplementary cameras (two each).  We were restricted to three (3) white cameras and had to wait over a week to order the fourth and final CG45W camera a major inconvenience for us. We recommend Amazon modify this policy by implementing a timely appeals/exception process, and/or possibly consider excluding Prime members from these restrictions.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Uniden Camera", "Author": "dacop", "ReviewID": "R2UMH5F2BOSSU9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Camera works as intended.

(Uniden Guardian G955 Wireless Security  I was pleased with the ease of setup on the G955 system and cameras.  Unlike reviews I saw for other or earlier systems, I CAN recognize people and critters in the no-light IR mode.  I have nine cats and can recognize every one of them on the monitor when they are recorded in the dark.  I could easily recognize my wife from some distance, also in the dark.  Distance thus far has been up to about 20 feet.  If you know the being you're viewing, you will be able to recognize them in the dark.  If you don't know who it is, someone who knows them will recognize them.Therefore, I went ahead an got two more cameras to bring the monitor up to its full four camera capacity.  The only issue I had with setup was pairing the two new cameras with the existing system.  You have to follow the G955 Owners Manual NOT the instructions that come with the GC45 camera (to answer questions asked by other buyers, the GC45 IS the camera that comes with the G955 monitor.)  To pair the cameras with the monitor, you have to begin the pairing on the monitor's camera pairing screen, then you have 60 seconds to get to the camera and press the \"Pairing\" button on the camera power cord.  If you do this, your camera will pair perfectly.  But, that process is not written in any of the instructions.Video is recorded in two-minute increments clearly identifying which camera the segment is from.  You can fast-forward through each segment.  All of this helps narrow down your search for a particular segment (I've done this three times already) and saves a lot of time.  The cameras go into sleep mode when there is no motion which also save time finding a desired video segment.  You can set the recording to overwrite old video clips so you don't run out of space on the Micro SD card.Overall, the G955 is a great small surveillance system and the GC45 cameras, though not HD, give pretty acceptable image quality.

The infrared capability at night is absolutely amazing... IR turns things black & white, but when it's pitch dark inside my shop, I can make out all my tool boxes, etc. and can even see the red light blinking on my wall phone 30 feet from the camera.This is my first Surveillance System, so I have nothing to compare it to, but considering the picture quality and everything in my title, I highly recommend it.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great addtion to my system", "Author": "Jimmy", "ReviewID": "R9Q3RPDK7E2JQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is top rated in my book.

However, it does have a few issues.  For instance, motion sensors on \"low\" are still too sensitive to changes in lighting.  Car headlights nearby and small bugs will trigger recording.  The red and green indicator lights on the front of the cameras are not very practical for outdoor use.  Spiders will build webs in front of the lights to catch bugs, setting off the camera in the process.  Also, the frames per second are not consistent, even when the base is stationary and wireless signals are good.  Wireless does interfere with home network, which tends to be an issue when you stream television shows.  And I wish it recorded sound.  I dont understand why it doesnt.  It is capable of doing so.

I don't know how long they will last.  I hope they are not as disposable as much of the Chinese products I end up purchasing because the last thing any manufacturer wants us to know is that their product is Chinese.  Nevertheless, the cameras were extras to complete a set.  I wish the cameras were stronger and have more focus.  The human images from 30 feet away are blurry at best.  The cameras work well outdoors but they need to be installed rather close to the hole bringing the power cable into the building if installed outdoors.  Had some trouble \"syncing\" the camera with the receiver, but after 15 to 20 minutes of trying it worked.  It can be frustrating if you are installing yourself and it is a tight fit.  I recommend \"syncing\" before installing.  If installed on a second floor, the cameras may be more useful as a deterrent rather than a camera to record evidence that can be tied to a particular person, as their face is likely to be unrecognizable. I like the \"wireless\" feature as it allows the receiver to be virtually anywhere in the building with reception.  The plus for the wireless is that you need less than professional installation as you do not need to wire your house up.  The cameras also have a sound feature, but is only for live feed, it does not actually seem to record sound.  The internet feature, and email notifications, are also very nifty but it takes some work to get it to work well.
