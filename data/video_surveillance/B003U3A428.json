I came back to order more but they have changed the design!  The older ones were actual casings from real cameras.  This new design looks incredibly fake and too \"plasticky\".  Also, how many real cameras have the cheesy flashing red light?  Almost none.  If you do buy these, at least don't put in batteries for the light to flash...that's a dead giveaway that they are fake cameras.  Unfortunately I will have to find another brand that isn't so obviously fake.Side note...a little trick I like to do is to label my FOUR cameras 1, 4, 7, 9 etc...if someone is sniffing around and they can only find four, they will expect that the others have to be somewhere that they can't find.", "Date": "October 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Looks like the real thing.", "Author": "Jeff", "ReviewID": "R2X6LXR5Y9WKK7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got these camera's in the time alotted.

Every year when school gets out it seems like the neighborhoods around there get small break-ins, nothing major. Her house had her window broken into, stole small amount of money and that's it. I purchased these for her to place around the outside of her house, and the back garage. They look real from a distance, but I think when you're really close to them, they look basic. We hung our high. The stickers were a nice touch. The only thing I would add to these is a battery for a red LED light. I had a camera as a kid that had 2 AA batteries that actually moved when it sensed motion... battery lasted over a year. I also recommend drilling a hole in the base of the mount, to feed the fake cord through on these, to make it look like the cord is being wired into the house.

Body is of cheap, brittle, shiny plastic unlike any real cameras I have owned or seen.  2-axis detented angle adjustments are extremely coarse so it's unlikely that you will get them pointed exactly where you want them to point.  Even if you are ultra-careful in tightening the screws, you will probably break the cheap plastic clamp mechanism in the angle adjustments (I did, on the last camera that I put up).  If you do, don't worry, just fill the joint with hot melt glue which is more secure than the crappy plastic that the camera is made out of.  The cameras are also pretty small (camera body about 5\" long by 2\" diameter) so if you mount them high enough to conceal the fake-ness a bit, they probably won't be noticed at all.Oh and the only one that I bothered trying the LED feature on -- it didn't work at all.  Batteries installed, took it into a dark closet, waited a minute, nothing.  There is a button to turn it on and off (no way to tell ON or OFF) and I tried pushing the button several times, still nothing.  Wasn't terribly surprised.
