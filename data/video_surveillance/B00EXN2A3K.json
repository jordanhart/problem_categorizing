{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not the camera shown", "Author": "Jack B.", "ReviewID": "R1TC2Z5Y7RX8CU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the cheap and crappy version of the muvee mini camera.  At an inflated price. The better versions have a metal housing and slide switches, which are very important for basic operation ot the camera.  The push switches on the cheaper versions have no way to verify the operation and the camera settings are difficult to know.  If you want the cheaper version, don't buy this one.  They are available for much less than this ad.  This seller appears to be trading on the photo, which is deceptive.  Not recommended.Also, this is not \"Signstek\", it is a no-name version.", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Never worked", "Author": "larry", "ReviewID": "R2PGRQS38HNKPG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Wouldn't even turn on.

This makes it virtually unusable until I can figure out how to improvise another way to stick  it on my door post.

The manual - like most Chinese manuals is horrible SO this is the UPDATE I made...[...] Like the Keyless Entry DVR I purchased from these guy...  I am very happy.. and I don't give my praises away...  Like the other DVR I shot a video without the instruction simply by turning on and pressing start button... plug it in.. device installs, opens folder... their is video.... Again not good lighting so quality was not perfect BUT better AGAIN than my Samsung Galaxy Proclaim phone in 720 mode.What was IMPRESSIVE was the packaging...  this little camera came with everything!  Mounts (Clip, Magnetic, screw down) a moisture proof cover, usb cable, Carry strap, fold out prong AC usb charger, Micr SD dongle, Nice Instruction Book, Micro-CD with driver and Manual..... All very nicely packaged.. For a VERY REASONABLE PRICE...  I WAS TAKEN BACK...
