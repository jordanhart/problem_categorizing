{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice little toy, but...", "Author": "Mate Vasilj \"tunin\"", "ReviewID": "R206FZ1TL8UQ92", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Hello all, after reading the few available reviews and a few youtube videos I ordered the camera (PRO HDR) as soon as it was available. It arrived on time and well packed. The first thing I noticed was that it seamed smaller than what I expected. The package contained the camera with the 19mm kit lens, 4 regular AA batteries, a little screw and a screwdriver and the manual... read the manual, sufficiently informative.Tested the cam and the true benefit was the battery life, it truly does wonders, I had it shooting a timelapse for 16hrs and the battery meter still shows fully charged. The build of the cam is nice, the only thing about the build was the kit lens is just way to wide, it seams wider than the one on my DRIFT GHOST and the GOPRO HERO3, I find it almost unusable for the timelapses I wanted to do. I wanted to order an additional lens but they are just overpriced at $400 for 18-55.What bothered me the most was the manual focus with the built-in screen is just complementary useless, it is pretty much trial and error when it comes to focus. The camera has the ability to zoom in for focus purposes but the image shown on the vertically oriented screen is just as poor as it gets.Another thing that I found strange was the GUI, it seams to me that it was made for people that do not use any other cameras, the settings of white balance and the other manual settings are deep in the GUI. Another thing about the GUI is, no matter what setting you change, one you hit OK you are back in the root menu, then you need to click your self back in to the are you were at to change the next thing in line or if you mistakenly changed something... I just find the keys and the GUI very fiddly at the least.Honestly, I am giving this camera another go and then I will most probably send it back.P.S.I bought the WATERPROOF HOUSING for $60, I expected something that will last for at least a few shoots, this is the worst type of waterproof enclosure I ever got. The plastic it was made from is the most fragile plastic on the market. The hinges are made of thin plastic with metal loops, one cracked the first day. The enclosure only fits the camera with the KIT lens. And this was for sure the worst part of my buy, basically I burned $60. I have 5 different underwater housings for different cameras/camcorders, the one from Drift GHOST I got for $35 is a TANK compared to this.On another note, I went to the BRINNO website to see if there is a Firmware upgrade for this cam., no luck, then I noticed that tlc200 firmwares is still at v1.0, and it has been on the market for a while now, it seams that they are happy withthe GUI and all and there is no plan to fix or improve things up... :(", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Brinno is making a name for itself.", "Author": "Just Chris", "ReviewID": "R3IV4UCNWX6M9A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ordered this on a whim because if something takes good pictures or has the potential for interesting movie making, I am interested.  Almost cancelled it wondering \"what did I need to time lapse?\", and glad I didn't.  I should also clarify that I bought this on a lightning deal that was less than the 299$ price it's currently at (Oct 2013), and I feel the 299$ is too much, but the 219$ or so that I paid was just fine.For me the biggest conveniences of this unit are that it takes regular AA batteries and they last FOREVER. I've probably recorded 5-6 days worth of captures and batteries were only 1/2 dead.  The other awesome thing is unlike a GoPro or other non-purpose-built units, the time lapse in this unit is automatic.  When you pull out the SDcard your movie is on it.  That is awesome to me.  No more animation shop or imovie creations - just slap it in and watch your movie.  It still produces a file that is easily edited in most common editors too - bonus.I also like that it has a tripod mount on the bottom as well as a big rubber pad. So far I have just let it sit around under its own weight on the pad, but the tripod will come in handy if I ever wanted to use this in a car or something (I have RAM mounts in my duty vehicle for example).On the down side, the menuing system is a little old school and I wish the display was touchscreen and a little faster. But really the settings you need are mostly there.  Yes you do get bumped out to the main screen once you \"set\" a change, annoying.  But you can adjust the frame rate (for playback encoding), the capture rate/interval, set a timer for capture period (days hours minutes) and even tweak the scene for stars, daylight, etc.At the end of it all , you get some ok \"instant time lapse video\" that you wouldn't have otherwise gotten. I've sort of discovered a whole new realm of photography that I have only dabbled in before, but thanks to Brinno I am now going to be sticking some neat time lapses into some of my home movie cut scenes.removed a star for the annoying screen/menu issues, but if I could add anything to this product it would be:+ let me interface with it from my phone, use low energy bluetooth and at least let me check if it's still recording or warn me if batteries are low.+ lose the annoying screen, and cheesy menus that bump you out to 'confirm' the change, you're charging 300$ for this thing it should excel compared to my 150$ gopro and it doesn't on menus.If you have bought this unit after Sept 2013, make sure you check for new firmware and update it.  It will add the timer mode and make it a little bit faster (not much).Hope you enjoyed this snapshot of my experience and good luck!", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm a Believer", "Author": "Gadget Ho(!)", "ReviewID": "R1L937AT4XHDVK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I waited for weeks for more (than 3) reviews before finally pulling the trigger on this one. I've done 2 tests at different settings so far (in daylight) and it works quite well! So it's not 1080p. So what? I found that a simple upscale in Premiere Pro with a moderate amount of sharpening fixes that. I own a GoPro Hero 3 and had thought of using it for time lapse in the field. Unfortunately, you'll never get the battery to last beyond 2-3 hours! And while there are plenty of external power supplies that WILL last overnight (check out the Anker Astro 3), there is the issue of either waterproofing a GoPro Skeleton Case (which you'll need to attach external power) or modding a standard GoPro waterproof housing (e.g. drilling just the right size hole for the miniUSB plug). Plus, there's no editing: It outputs AVIs. Very nice... So, no, it won't blow you away. But it's a nice toy for about the right price.", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "What a Fun Camera !", "Author": "Fm Koiwai \"New Sock Lover!\"", "ReviewID": "R3FA15VZ11D35K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very clever and capable camera. It might seem that it's a bit frivolous buying a camera whose main purpose is to shoot time lapse videos (I haven't tried the Motion Detection Trigger accessory yet) but think about it. Whenever you have a social event I know I'm always distracted by wanting to take still photos, trying to capture the right moment, changing batteries, etc. etc. But if you set up one of these Brinno's you can set back and enjoy the get together while this provides the photo coverage. My friends love getting the resulting video which captures so many fun moments. As it advertises, the output is a FINISHED video ... no having to convert stills into a video. It's low light capabilities are very impressive ... better then a GoPro3 even. This video clip is embarrassing but it so well shows it's low light capabilities:  https://vimeo.com/67400404 The room was only lit by the sliver of light coming in from behind the shade. In fact I MINUSED the exposure by two lines worth in the Custom Settings to help preserve the feeling of darkness. Yes, I'm a Pro ... so I LOVE having convenience on my side when I'm doing things for fun! I need to get the water proof housing so that I can keep shooting with the kids spraying water, my racing competitors spraying champaign and lovely Rain to Sunshine time lapses ... hopefully with a Rainbow forming.

It was down and dirty, but that was what kept the price so low and allowed me to do things with them that I would not have felt comfortable with had it been a more expensive piece of equipment.  This costs a good deal more than those versions, but you now can get highly usable footage. I feel the cost is justified.  Brinno is smart and builds on what they do well with, I look forward to seeing what comes next.

I've always wanted to do time lapse, but never wanted to get into all the mechanics of it.  Who wants to tie up an expensive camera and risk it getting damaged or \"permanently relocated?\"  Brinno makes time lapse stupid easy.  It is almost a miracle in the palm of your hand.  I read the manual, set up the camera and did a great first video of carpet being installed in my game room.  Here's all it takes:  Position the camera, select the capture interval, turn the camera on, record the event, turn it off, let the Brinno do its thing (image processing), pop out the flash card, slip it in the computer.  iPhoto loads it -- BOOM!  You've got a time lapse movie.  It saves as an AVI, but when you load it into quick time (as in play it in quick time) it automatically gets converted into a .mov.  It's that easy.  No assembling in post (as with the GOPRO unit).  Seriously, this thing makes time lapse as easy as taking a snap shot.  Image quality is very good.  Size is shockingly small -- in the palm of your hand.  Light weight.  I was even pleased with the packaging -- rivals that of apple products.  This is truly a user friendly device.

Very much appreciated because I have been wanting to get back to my old hobby.After only two long term trials I am in love.  The picture quality is great.  The motion is very smooth.  I used to do time lapse manually with a squeeze ball trigger so I really appreciate the ability to program the time between frames with such flexibility.  I have a project in mind and this little gem is going to get me there.  It has a great range of settings to get the picture just right.

It has allowed me to get more into the art of time lapse.  I was using my Canon T3i with Magic Lantern to make time lapse movies and that set up works well but is bulky and expensive.  The Brinno TLC200 Pro is small and inconspicuous so people don't notice it which makes for more natural action and I think less of a chance someone will notice and steal it.  It is very easy to set up and operate.  Battery life is very good so far.

I love time lapse videos and as a writer, decided that I wanted to incorporate video into my posts. This is the perfect gadget for someone like me that wants to do the videos but doesn't have the time to stitch pics together and all of the editing that goes with it. My first video was at the beach and I wanted to capture sunset and the sunrise. I purchased the protective housing for the camera, snapped it on and set the camera. It was intuitive and very easy for me to understand (which was important.)The video required very little editing, captured the moments and have I mentioned how easy it was for me to figure out? That was really important because if something is difficult I lose interest. What I really liked about the PRO200 is the ability to get a WiFi connection and upload automatically to my computer, also the ability to video on a set schedule,those two things make this camera a winner if you need to focus on specific images, like myself.

Crawford", "ReviewID": "R2UB70XALL5MAZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had the TLC200 for over a year and recently decided to upgrade to the Pro. The Pro is a substantially improved product and well worth the extra cost. Among the improvements:First and most important, greatly improved picture quality, especially in high-contrast and low-light shots. Naturally the quality is not what I get from my full-frame DSLR but for general use it is far more convenient. Also, I can mount the camera inconspicuously to watch tides, clouds or other events without worrying about damaging or losing a $4k DSLR or about having the 4-5,000 frames I typically shoot in a day eat into the expected 150,000 shot shutter life of my DSLR.Second, much faster response with the trigger button for stop-motion videos. The basic unit was painfully slow between shots but the Pro is snappy so now my daughter enjoys making stop-motion videos with it.Third, interchangeable lenses. Since I have a collection of old c-mount lenses, the standard mount interchangeable lens feature is great (and is also a great improvement for anyone who wants to mate the camera to a microscope or similar device). Also, the wider angle view with the default included lens is another welcome improvement.On the downside, the user interface is a tad clunky but sufficient once you get used to it. Some operations, especially switching into ready mode or ending a timelapse can at times be very slow leading you to wonder if you hit the button. Again, you get used to it and the camera spends most of its time sitting and shooting anyway.It seems that the exposure is adjusted on each shot or few shots so when light changes the overall scene can have an undesirable sudden shift in brightness. Same with the auto-white-balance. Usually this isn't a huge problem but it can sometimes rear it's head with passing clouds and the like. Setting manual white-balance helps and manual exposure might help but I haven't tried that, yet.The ability to use external USB power is nice but the time or two I have tried it the camera shuts off shooting when I plug in the cable. I need to test carefully to see if there is a way to have the USB simply take over from the battery when available without interrupting shooting. I don't yet know if that is possible.Finally, the camera is relatively simple to operate with a simple manual to match but it would be nice to have some more advanced information available for those who want it to improve their shots. For example, more detail on how the HDR and scene modes actually operate, what impact they have on battery life and how the various manual exposure controls work.", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice time lapse camera.", "Author": "David W Sussman", "ReviewID": "R1RSKHV7GGLPOO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm a professional photographer that has many different types of time-lapse (TL) gear. I've been looking for some type of TL gear that is not too expensive to leave outdoors, as well as having good battery life (over one month with proper settings) and be able to inter-change lenses. Brinno has filled that void with the TLC200 Pro. It's not professional time-lapse in the sense that the movie file is already produced as an AVI. You can set 1 fps to 1 frame every 30 minutes and it will shoot HDR compile the three images into one and produce the movie file without any additional software. The standard lens is super wide with other lenses available. However their longer lens is not easy to install or focus for that fact. I also bought an all weather protective case for leaving the unit outdoors for up to a month. It's a very nice addition allowing access to the timer and menu. You can also connect external power and connect to the USB from the weather case. Other lenses do not work with this case. The only reason I gave this unit a three star rating is because I compare it to professional time lapse equipment. For the most part I would recommend the camera to even professionals understanding that it is another specialized piece of gear for some occasions.

I'm not happy.Setting it up is a pain. It's push this button then that button, then ... I always wind up in circles.The camera doesn't seem to have any way of shooting night time (city lights) and then the dawn without completely over exposing scenes as it gets lighter. I don't know how they shot the images used to promote the camera. The image quality is OK, but not great (it can't hold a candle to the GoPro) there's no infinity setting for the lens focus. I focused it and locked it down, but it still somehow shifted out of focus. (Focusing is a pain, but not completely impossible, you shift focus in and out, in and out, and find that middle part that's a little bit better than the out of focus, the tiny monitor isn't good enough for any precision--which is why a default infinity focus would really help.)VIDEO CLIP: The motion detector works great if you wave your hand a few inches from it, but it vignettes the shot. Two large crows landing two feet in front of it failed to set it off. I've got a lot of clips of me setting it up, testing it and then there's some inexplicable shot and that's it, cars, animals walking right in front of it... nothing. I'll try to attach the video that missed the crows. There's some food right in the foreground, the  crows take the food, but the Brinno completely fails to start shooting until they leave the frame. The vignetting is caused by mounting the motion detector on the lens--Completely inadequate design.What really ticked me off is I shot fog at night, then I shot the sunrise -, then I shifted the camera to capture a crew of guys cleaning out a yard. Not a single frame. I've had this a week, I'm a professional, I make machines--at some point it's not me, it's inadequate design.The plus side it can be set up and will run for days on a set of batteries. It's an interesting device, but I don't think it's ready for prime time.Update 2/24/14 Tried to contact Brinno:1. The camera seems to no longer do more than make a single still image, but 'records' so I have many minutes of a static shot--no change, time stamp no change as well.  2. Is there a way to upgrade the firmware with an Apple Computer? I've several other concerns. The motion detector seems almost useless. Crows, cats daylight scenes, approaching to within 2 feet of the camera--yet no images, or a delayed image after they've left. Cars don't seem to activate it.Their website failed to send the e-mail. Not good.I'd like to get some use out of this camera, there are so many problems. I'm also finding it nearly impossible to find the Menu item to adjust the Interval between shots. These binary -two or three button controls seem designed by engineers to be nearly impossible to use. I can't even follow the simple instructions on the website. Is the ASAP interval only available with the firmware upgrade? Or is it buried in the menu?I have a couple of weeks before I have to decide to keep or return the camera.", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "I liked it.", "Author": "Bruce Nonemaker", "ReviewID": "R1X08QWILQNULJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yes, very good quality video.

The images are definitely not on par with a DSLR or even a newer iPhone. However, the stitched videos come out surprising crisp - and with very good battery life. If you are considering one of these, I would say the HDR is definitely worth the upgrade for the price difference.This is not a camera that you would want to use outdoor in dynamic weather (or rain) without the weather resistant case. One of the things I like most about the camera is the articulating lens - you can prop the camera on just about any surface and then tilt the lens to get the angle tuned for the perfect amount of ground/horizon/sky for your composition preference. But if you are using the weather resistant case, you lose the ability to tilt the lens.The preview is good for making sure you're set, but once you go to record the preview ends. Great for battery life, but there have been more than a couple of times I really wanted to see what was happening in regards to lighting.All in all I am happy with the purchase.", "Date": "November 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrible Video Quality", "Author": "Thomas A.

I had been using a low cost camcorder with time lapse capability.  I purchased the Brinno TLC 200 since it offered any time segment I wanted (the camcorder only went up to 80 seconds) and compiled the images into video format.The time lapse feature work OK, but the video quailty is so poor (even though this is advertised as an HD camera) that I am unable to interpret the images in the video.Unfortunately I do not have the original packaging this unit came in so I am unable to return it.  Since I bought the BCS 18-55 lense also, I now have almost $600 invested in something that is worthless to me.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredible camera!", "Author": "Tim Janson", "ReviewID": "R3KJB5DSUZ07QZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A time lapse video camera is probably something you don\u2019t think about needing but once you have it you wonder how you managed without it.  The TLC 200 Pro is a 1.3 MP camera that shoots video in 1280 X 720 (16:9 ratio) in AVI format.  The unit runs and has remarkable life on just 4 AA batteries.  The unit comes with a 4 GB SDHC card and can support up to 32 GB.  It is also functional as a webcam with Wi-F connectivity making it a snap to upload videos to your computer.With this camera you set the length of time you want the camera to capture video and you are off!  The TLC 200 can capture FAR more shots than a regular DSLR camera.  It\u2019s major advantage of standard cameras/video cameras is that it automatically creates an AVI file which you can immediately download without the need for an file conversion needed.  It\u2019s remarkably easy and I am hardly a camera expert.  The camera is wonderful for capturing events with outstanding quality even in low light conditions.  In fact it won\u2019t be long until you realize just how much, or at least how useful a time lapse camera can be compared to standard cameras.  You will find uses for it as perhaps a security cameral while you\u2019re gone, capturing nature shots, the possibilities are endless.The LCD menu is large and easy to navigate.  Saving a change send you back to the begging which makes it easy but can be annoying if you\u2019re making other changes. In the menu you can adjust your settigns for day/night recording, frame rate, capture rate, and record time in minutes, hours, or even days. The aspherical lens has a 112 degree field of vision, with a rotation capability of 120 degrees.  Images are nice quality but can be blurry at a slow shutter speed.  The manual focus can also be wonky.Now what makes the TLC 200 especially useful is the huge number of accessories that are available.  Yeah sure after paying in the area of $300 you might think spending more is excessive but truly bring out the full capabilities of the camera such as a clear, waterproof housing, wall mount, motion sensor, bike mount, interchangeable lenses, an OTG card reader, and stop motion shutter release cable.  Yes it\u2019s a bit of a \u201ctoy\u201d type of item and by that an item you don\u2019t have to have but one that\u2019s a lot of fun.", "Date": "February 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Customer-shot time

Settings were: image every 10 seconds, video at 30 frames per second.  This compressed 1 hour of events into only 12 seconds of video.  Pretty impressed so far.  It took very little time to navigate through the menus and set it up.(The event in the video is a load test of an overhead crane, performed by filling enornmous bladders with tons of water.)", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great product!", "Author": "John E Carlton Jr", "ReviewID": "R1E7OHY63H3HFF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The first one I got was bad and no idea how that got through quality control.

Beautifully packaged, nice manuals (no Engrish despite being a Taiwanese company) and everything in the box needed to instantly start using it. Still getting the hang of settings, but the first sunset I captured was awesome. Also tried it as a dashboard cam while driving which worked cool. And the HDR imagery was very nice. Night time was a touch noisy but amazing pics! It captured stars on film that light pollution made it impossible to see with the naked eye! Very cool product and a great value - I won't cry if I lose one or damage it in a project since it's so cheap - in the past I'd have to use a DSLR and risk it. You might not be able to get the quality of timelapse like in the House of Cards title sequence but you will get darn close! This is a dream product and I'm going to get a few more and use Eye-Fi SD cards and have them transfer footage wirelessly as security cams.  Menus are a bit goofy and it's not perfect, but so nice for the money and nothing anywhere else competes with its battery life and lowlight HDR quality.

The format is 1280x720 .AVI (and you get to specify the frame rate up to 30fps).- Lens swivels to point from directly up to, say, 45 degrees down (total about 135 degrees).- Almost completely no lens flare when shooting at the sun.- Built in timer (but only 1 range, and only in 15 min increments i.e. x:00, x:15, x:30, x:45).- Battery efficient. It comes with 4 AA batteries included and they lasted days of recording.- Option to use AC power. I've also got a standard micro-usb charger plugged in (as a supply, not a battery re-charger) when a power point is handy.- 4GB card included. Depending on your settings 4GB may not last long but between the included batteries and memory card this is eminently giftable.What's not to like:- Not HD. 720p is nice but 1080p would have been nicer.- Review. There is no way to see what you've recorded on the device itself so you have to transfer it first.- Wifi. You can pop out the sdcard or use a micro-usb cable to transfer but that soon gets annoying. I bought an Eye-Fi x2 16gb which work great together.- Cheaper lens. The fisheye lens that comes standard is quite distorting of anything more than, say, 30 degrees from middle. The advantage of the PRO is that lens can be replaced but sadly other lenses are more expensive than the unit itself.p.s. the 3-button menu system is neither liked nor disliked since it is basic but functional, fiddly but rarely needed.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "clever device", "Author": "S.
