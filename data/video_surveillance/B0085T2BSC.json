The quality is subpar and when recording in manual mode, the files saved were always corrupted. I could not get any long, continuous video out of this recorder and what I could get using motion detection was of extremely (very) low quality. Sadly, there do not seem to be many choices out there for mini DVRs without cameras...", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Misrepresented Junk", "Author": "Robert  D Haynes", "ReviewID": "RKWSRQTNLWFQJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I only gave it 1 star to be able to rate it it is misrepresented as HD and able to record audio it can't do either of these its poorly made I'll never by Chinese electronics again and Amazon should know better!", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "very poor made design not a good product", "Author": "jj", "ReviewID": "R1FZQVSCWB9P09", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received it and it went bad on me right away.

This was not stated in description or specifications when ordered. Since it has limited documentation, customer service stated to me, \"the on screen menu can change which output standard to use.\" Without this knowledge, the blurred PAL video displayed on an NTSC TV made it harder to navigate through the menu to find this setting. But once set, everything worked fine. My recommendation is to supply a manual with the units in future.Thank you BrainyTrade Customer Service SupportSincerely,Dale", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Defective  horizontal hold", "Author": "JACK R.", "ReviewID": "RYYT31GV2P6SO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the picture fluttered continuously. sent it back will try another one same design different item. is that enough words now?", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$63.99", "Features": "Portable motion detection audio video SD Mini recorder DVR system. 2 AV input (video), 1AV output (video).\nIdeal for baby monitor, driving record, vehicle monitor record, etc. Supports 2 cameras simultaneously (one recordes video , the other takes pictures).\nConnects to TV or monitor through the provided audio and video cable.
