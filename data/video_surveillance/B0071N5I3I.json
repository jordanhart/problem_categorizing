Williams \"Tdub\"", "ReviewID": "R2ILB5K6P5XHE5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is the last time I buy something based on few recent reviews, for a new product. It seems the first few reviews are done by \"company men\". I feel hoodwinked on this one. I agree with all of the negative comments, then some. Camera is nice except the SD card reader is deficient. It worked for awhile then didn't work. The software is the big problem. It is unstable so you can't rely on it to keep tabs on your property while you are away for the weekend - it often causes the computer to crash, or the software hangs. The event recording functions simply do not work. Customer service was unable to resolve the problem (they took my number and email and said they would call me back when they figured it out - they didn't respond). It is supposed to be able to record to the SD card (for later download to your computer by you) events triggered by, e.g., sound or movement in the subject monitored area. But no go. No record. No nothing. The only thing is does it doesn't do well. It does give you a live picture of the monitored scene for any computer on the net. But many of the settings don't work. E.g., this camera is supposed to be high resolution but the software doesn't stay on the options you select. Instead, it does it's own thing next time you call up the program. The software is browser based, but the bandwidth provided is so low that the program often times out waiting for a selected page to load. It boggles my mind why someone would put an item like this in the market without having the software ready for the end use. You just ruin your reputation (Zyxel) and waste a lot of people's time.", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great, but could be better with firmware update!", "Author": "klas", "ReviewID": "R7FX58OIT3V72", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was hesitant buying this camera at first based on the first review posted here, but decided to give it a shot anyway and I am glad I did. I will not go over every feature this camera has, but only mention main features that I liked and didn't. I do own 3 other PTZ cameras (EDIMAX IC-7010PTn) which were about the same price as this one with similar set of features; however, they lacked in image quality and night vision capabilities, so my expectations for this camera were a bit higher.The Good: - Image quality is good, although not quite HD as you would expect, but images are sharp and you can see plenty of detail during daylight - F1.5 (or perhaps its F1.8) lens is making this camera very usable in the dusk setting without turning IRs. - In complete darkness IRs provide excellent amount of power. - Colors reproduction surprisingly very good. - Plenty of manual features to adjust the image if required - Excellent feature where you can quickly rotate camera to preferred positionThe OK: - Size of the unit was unexpectedly bigger then expected. It is larger then my other PTZ cameras, but it's not a big deal. - There is mobile page that you can view on your smartphone, but it's limited to VGA resolution and you can only control the camera movement. I had an issue where it wouldn't reflect changes in the brightness settings. - Wireless signal seems to be weak, I will see what I can do to improve. Camera sits right next to a Asus rt-N56u router  and shows only 56% signal strenth. - Slow to initialize camera, probably due to ActiveX. It could take between 5-10 seconds depending on your picture settings before you can see anything. - Clunky user interface, but could be updated over time - Microphone is on the weak side, but you can plugin external one if needed.The Not So Good: - Some firmware Bugs as expected in initial product release. - Wireless configuration does not work in the web interface. There are configuration options available, but they are limited to SSID & Keyphrase, you can't select type of encryption. You have to configure it using provided disk. - Live view web UI currently works in IE and it requires installation of ActiveX controls. In Chrome it gives you a message \"VLC plugin is not detected\" and prompts you to go videolan.org website. I downloaded 2.x vlc player and I see the plugin is being shown in Chrome browser, but it still doesn't work. Zyxel reported they are working on to support latest vlc plugin. - Camera occasionally becomes unresponsive and you have to unplug the power source to reset it, possible due to using wireless and when running high quality HD resolution. - If you switch to Motion Adaptive 720p (HD mode) your viewing angle becomes narrow and the picture is not wide format. Even if you toggle to full screen the resolution still appears SXGA and not 720p. There should be an option to switch it to wide format, but I did not find before I returned the camera. - Camera resets video settings to default (specifically 1 & 2 Stream video settings and from Turbo Picture to Motion Adaptive). It could happen if you unplug from the power source or after sometime for no reason. As reported this was due to using iSecurity. - Tilt down is limited when the camera sits on a flat surface. Disappointed in this design limitation because I wanted to be able to point the camera down from the balcony on the second floor. The work around is it put something underneath the back of the camera. - I have not found if there is an option to embed a time stamp to show in the image. If it's not available it could be enabled with the firmware update. - Camera doesn't have a feature where you can have a hyperlink to a static jpg image. I use this feature in my other PTZ cameras, but it may not be important to everyone.EDIT: I've updated my review a bit and changed it to 4 stars.

All of sudden, it stopped working and you have to reset it to wake it up. I was stupid to buy two of them at the first place. Both of them have the same problem. So it seems a common issue.

I consider myself to be a mid-level IT guy (considering that is what I do in my career - I currently hold 3 industry certifications A+, Network+, and Security+, while working for my CCNA). This camera has proofed to be a pitiful excuse of a product.For starters, the box appeared to be an opened box. The internal packaging also seemed to have been tampered with, although everything was included. Looking past that, lets move on to the actual device.The camera itself is not as robust as it makes itself out to be. While it does do DDNS, ZyXEL does not offer the DDNS hosting, you have to go through no-ip.org. For the short period of time that the camera did work for me, the quality of the image was below par, not of 720P quality. The wireless is actually a USB adaptor that plugs into the device, so it is not actually built it. The wireless is also insanely slow considering I had it 5 feet away (direct line of site) of my wireless AP (Linksys E4500v1 - dual band wireless N). I don't consider myself a Guru of IP cameras, but I have installed cameras for my company including Axis and Sony IPELA's. This camera is quite difficult to configure (if you use the web interface). If you use the 'easy' wizard, it is relatively simple, but in order to do that, you have to use a Windows PC (and you can only view the web based image through a 32bit browser), Macs are not compatible with the easy wizard. Once I finally got it to work (which took me a little more than half a day of solid work), after rebooting the device (to move it to the location in which it was going to live) it stopped working. Now I cannot even get it to reset to factory following the procedure in the manual. No updated firmware exists for this device either...Avoid this camera like the plague. I am returning it immediately to get a different brand.", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Software does not work, & Tech support sucks!!!", "Author": "Gary", "ReviewID": "R3CPT1V28RKF43", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am a tech, & this cameras on-board software, & it's PC software both Suck!

They do not call you back, & cannot answer questions without putting you on hold to ask a higher level tech (level 2) about your issues. Finally asked for level 2 who gives you the run around, & never calls you back. They just tell you that the software manager is out of the country, & that they will call you back once he responds. This camera's software will not save video to a network drive (other cameras do this). The camera will not save any of the event trigger information, & Zyxel does not provide a Static IP like other manufacturers do.

The video is much better than my non 720p cameras (which I expected), but if you're expecting NBC style broadcast video, you shouldn't be looking at a camera in this price point.  I had a hard time getting it configured initially.  The iSecurity+ website seemed to be down when I first tried, so couldn't use the auto-configuration software.  It has since come back up, but I haven't gone through that process yet.  I was able to work with iCam Source tech support to get help on adding it to my network. They were great and the same advice also worked on the EvoCam software to get it added to my network of random cameras.  If you're looking for the video feed link, use http://yourIP/mjpeg.cgiThis is streaming the video perfectly, however I can't use the pan/tilt features like I can with some of my other cams.

After firmware update camera works almost perfect. I didn't set Cloud option. I use only PC web browser or IPCamViewer for iPhone or Android. I stay with 1.1 firmware. The 1.4 firmware makes my camera reboot by it self. I post videos on youtube so you can see how it works.First with 1280x720 settings:http://youtu.be/f4V-kUOUYvkand the other one with SXGA settings:http://youtu.be/JO-7C1rYbGoLink to night performance video:http://youtu.be/iDt9-zn7I0sLink to night performance video with 1280x720:http://youtu.be/5JFGQitM8Kshere another video showing picture from Zyxel on my iPhone 5 and iPad using IPCamViewer:http://youtu.be/hUanyffK8i8With this price ($139) I can't complain. I'm also using Wansview and Apexis clone VGA cameras (more than half of the price of Zyxel) but the quality of picture is horrible compare to Zyxel. I will update review later when new camera came.Also, like terry jm (check his review), I used the software only to find IP of the camera in my network so I can login and set all my needed settings. You can find the IP also by login to your router and check DHCP devices list. I'm going to try again the 1.4 firmware (just got the email from Zyxel and they said no any problems with it).To be able to view camera from outside of your home network you have to open account on free DDNS service. I use dyndns.org for years without any problems. Then just put you dns name and login (for your dyndns) in network settings in you camera and you are done. Also you have to setup you router, so address of your camera in your home network is accesible from outside (port forwarding or DMZ host).07/04/2013Just added one star to five stars.I think this is the best IP camera now, with the price $139 you can't find better deal.After one year on my balcony, still works excellent.

I like that these are made of metal rather than plastic.  Owned for 4 weeks.  Bought these to replace poor quality Wansview HD cameras.  I purchased from another site because amazon price was too high.  But amazon has now reduced their price to match the other site at $193.99.  I was lucky to get my first camera on sale for $163 at the other site.The biggest problem I had with this camera was the Easy Install software.  The easy install forced me to sign up for an iSecurity+ account on the Zyxel website before I could continue with setup.  The easy setup did not allow me to opt out.  If you sign up for iSecurity+, it automatically resets the camera to 320 X 240 resolution every time you reboot the camera because iSecurity+ only supports the lowest resolution.  Reset your camera to factory defaults and perform setup using your web browser to disable iSecurity+ and bypass the easy setup.I now only use Easy Install until it gives me the IP address of my camera.  Then I terminate easyinstall and enter the IP address in my browser to perform camera setup.The only defect I have found in my particular configuration is that the audio volume resets itself to default every time the camera is rebooted.  Customer support clams they are not able to reproduce this.  I have determined by doing their testing for them that the camera will maintain the volume setting if iSecurity+ mode is used.  The camera will NOT maintain volume level if iSecurity mode is not used.  Hopefully we will recieve a firmware update soon for this defect.I'm happy with the IR distance at night.  Much much better than my Trendnet camera which is pretty useless at a few meters without suplemental light.  I'd love to have a camera with 50ft IR distance, but I don't think that is possible in this price range without buying a separate IR device to supplement the onboard emiters.At first I was disappointed by the odd power connectors on these cameras, but then I realised that they allow third party POE connections to be used, or you can unscrew the wire from the connector so that you can drill a very small hole for the power adapter.  These were designed to support professional installation applications which is a plus.", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not worth the money.  Get an SD one instead.

I'm on firmware 1.4.Chose Zyxel over Foscam FI9820 because it seemed better built.  The Zyxel seems to be of a sturdier build but not sure what it means longer term.  A bit larger than the Foscam.  From memory, the Zyxel seems to have sharper pics but I believe the Foscam may have wider field of view.  The Zyxel has great IR for night viewing.Setup was straight forward enough to get streaming up and running.  The two stars are for the following reasons:1. http but no https option.2. camera will randomly change position.  I'm using it as a baby monitor and almost daily have to change the pan/tilt position to reset it to where I need it.3.  suppose to have onboard speaker but I can't get it to work.  The Foscam onboard speaker worked right out of the box for two directional conversation.4. admin is a default user for the Zyxel.  For security reasons, I always change the admin name or delete it from every device.  It's not hard to go online and search any device manual to find the default login and password.  Zyxel has made the admin account a permanent account so you can't delete it and you can't modify it to have non-admin privileges.  So essentially, anyone can type in admin and keep guessing the password as there's also no lock out for failed attempts.When the camera does a random motion and the reasons noted above, it makes you feel that someone out there is watching you...not a comforting feeling.I give the image and setup overall a 4 out of 5 stars (improve with wider field of view and smaller size to fit in more areas).Zyxel team, please respond to any of the issues above and I would be happy to test and update my feedback.Hope someone finds this helpful.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "An ok camera if you can get it cheap enough", "Author": "secstate \"Computer Geek\"", "ReviewID": "RA1M5JF54HXNT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased two of these from an online deals site for less than Amazon is selling them for.  For the price I paid they are OK.  I use them on a wired network and rely on BlueIris software for motion detection and recording so my review does not address either wireless with this camera or any of its built in motion sensing/recording functions.  As a camera for BlueIris it does ok.  The picture quality is decent (way better than the 480p Foscams but not as good as my 3MP Hikivision bullets) and the IR works well though it has more of a flashlight effect than some other cameras I have.The only problem I have with this camera is both of mine do randomly reboot and this can be seen in the BlueIris logs where it loses communication with the camera for a few minutes.  This happens on both cameras and remember I run them on wired network not wireless so it is not a wireless issue.  As another poster has stated version 1.4 firmware is more prone to random reboots and its reboots tend to resent where the camera is pointed.  The 1.1 firmware by contrast reboots much less and does not reset the aim of the camera.  For this reason I run 1.1.  Basically this is more or less what you get with the cheap Chinese cameras.
