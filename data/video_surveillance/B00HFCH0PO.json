Shortly after Swann released a whole new product line. Now that I upgraded to Windows 7 my system is basically non functional. I will say I had no product complaints when my system was running on older windows platform. I spent over 3 hours between on hold, and Swann tech support to no avail, and Swann sales wouldnt offer so much as a discount on new product. Swann advertises \"lifetime support\" which is obviously not the case! I am not going to invest anymore money into Swann products because who knows if it will work properly with next generation windows pc's? So buyer, please be aware and research before purchasing.", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00HFCH0PO"}}
