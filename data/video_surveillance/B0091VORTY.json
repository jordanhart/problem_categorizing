If you are reading this you might be new to the camera scene so I will point out a few things I would have liked to know before starting............1st - These are 3.6mm Lens which is a wide angle lens. If you need to narrow in on an area, object, or face, get a higher lens. If you want to see as much as possible, (During the day) these are the right cameras. Do some research, find a lens chart.2nd - These are CMOS cameras. You may get false colors, mostly purple in grass or trees. This is normal for CMOS cameras. Again, do some research on CCD cameras vs CMOS. CCD cameras are more expensive.3rd - LEDs. 12 LEDs are enough to give you a good night image on an enclosed area such as a hallway, porch, or spot close to the camera. Don't expect much night vision if you are pointing this out into a yard or driveway. You wont see 30ft. For broad coverage, a 3.6mm CCD camera with 36-48 LED's will give you far better night vision.4th - These are 480 TVlines. Dont expect to make a positive ID. The most you can expect from these is getting a good idea of who or what you see. (What kind of car / dog or cat / male or female etc)700TVL isn't much better.5th - Power. If you plan on upgrading to better cameras in the future, esp with more LEDs, you have to make sure you have enough power. This kits comes with a 1.5 Amp power supply which is the minimum to run these cameras. I bought a 5 amp power supply although this is something you can do later when upgrading.Overall, these are good to get you up and running quickly and for cheap. They are good to experiment with and get your system the way you want it. Once you have things in place, you can upgrade the camera by simply taking out the old one and putting in a new one. You can leave the mounts and wires in place. With these cameras and a 4 channel DVR, you can have a camera system for under $200.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great but be aware.", "Author": "Luis C.", "ReviewID": "R3UJ1VGYEMR40W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought two Zmodo upgradable dvr's with four cameras systems, one for me and the other for my mom's house... some weeks after  I bought various \"4 cameras combos\" (this ones) to upgrade the system... the surprise was that the cameras on this set have less leds that the ones that came with the base package.But anyway, they work perfectly and if you budget is reduced, you can have a security system for almost nothing.", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great With zmodo H.264 DVR recorder", "Author": "sammy toke", "ReviewID": "R22B5DOKQVLX2S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It goes along Great with the zmodo H.264 DVR!
