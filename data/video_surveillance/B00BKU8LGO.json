So far the only complaint I have is the angles I have to use make it difficult to make out faces, but this has nothing to do with the quality of the unit itself.  Pics are great quality and even at night I can make out images quite easily.  The way I hooked it up I can now see all cars going down my street, anyone coming up to my house and if I want to see what car is here I can easily look at the monitor instead of walking out front.  Works great.  I did not hook up to the internet so I didnt have to go through that set up.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,899.99", "Features": "16CH Alarm Inputs & 2CH Alarm Outputs: With alarm inputs and outputs, you are able to complete the whole surveillance system with external alarm devices or systems, which enable you to enjoy the convenience of advanced security.\nNot Baseline, Not Main Profile, It's H.264 High Profile: The High Profile is the most powerful profile in H.264, and it allows most efficient coding of video.
