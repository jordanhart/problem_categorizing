I purchase this device with the \"SVAT CCDCO Mini Indoor CCD Pinhole Camera Kit\" and I'm happy ever since.Here is what I have found after 30 days of use:**Installation:  Can't be easier, just plug and play, it comes with everything I needed and something I don't (a CD that I haven't found the need of use).**Setting up the system (date, time, video quality ...): I had a problem here, I hooked up the device on my LED TV but it didn't show any video signal (I don't know why), I tried using another monitor and it worked just fine (I purchased  the \"3.5 Inch TFT LCD Monitor for Car\" with a \"DC Female to 4 Male Power Splitter Cable\" to power it up), just fallow the manual to set up the device.**Recording Time:  This is my favorite part, with a 32 GB memory, in QVGA mode (320*240),  I get 9 days of continuous recording time, that's it much better than I expected.I hope this review helps you somehow, sorry if I misspelled something, I'm not good with English and this is my firs review.", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "No problems .. performs as expected", "Author": "J. P. Freeley", "ReviewID": "R1VZ5AF8Z0MK18", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "**UPDATE BELOW**** NEW UPDATE BELOW **1) First I had problems being able to write to the card. I think that you need a) to have power plug OUT .. b) insert card .. c) then power on. After this, I had no problems writing to the card.2) Playback from device seems to be B&W; only, however, playback via VLC on computer was color with timestamp in bottom right. (See update below)3) It's certainly compressed video, the playback isn't as clean as the original source. (See update below)4) The manual is in \"chin-lish\" .. but it all seems to make sense.5) Passthrough to external monitor image is as clean as original. (but playback is not see #2 & #3)6) All in all, really not bad for the money paid, I am waiting on a different model tomorrow which is 2x the price. I'll let you know which turns out to be tops.7) The size of this unit is about same as pack of cigarettes .. quite compact.8) It TAKES MICRO-SD cards (what the manufacturer seems to refer to as TF cards (tiny flash??))9) Navigation and setup very barebones and simple.10) I have not played too much with Motion Detection feature, but it does seem to have the feature.11) It comes default set to PAL TV output. Easy enough to change to NTSC, but this change is not done via the menu system. You need to add a file to the ROOT-DIR of your Micro-SD card called \"system.txt\" .. that file should contain only 7 characters .. F15V0S9 == F = Framerate (default 15) V = video system (default 0 for PAL .. change to 1 for NTSC) .. S = sensitivity (dafault 9) they say higher number = more sensitive. They say to remove the file once it has been read once since it will otherwise be read during boot each time which is unnecessary.1-star off for the obviously compressed video quality, which might not be fair to the unit, but I would have liked to have seen slightly better quality. FYI, I am running an Everfocus EHD730 Camera as input.**UPDATE AFTER A DAY OF PLAYING WITH IT**Regarding #2 above: The playback on through the device is IN COLOR. Maybe I just had it in a strange state PAL vs. NTSC in my initial experience.Regarding #3 above: lower frame rates (5fps) seem to have better playback quality (this is to be expected) .. but still not as good as original source (also to be expected).A thought: At the price of this unit, it may be advantageous to place it \"inline\" for each camera with a more standard \"security DVR\" for backup purposes perhaps as it's passthrough video is clean \"original image quality\" and for a small camera system, it might be nice to be able to simply pop a card and save/share the video.. again, just a thought.** NEW UPDATE **See my review of another portable DVR product, where I compare directly to this product .. http://www.amazon.com/VideoSecu-Detector-Recorder-Security-Surveillance/dp/B002QHBNXI/** Will update again should the need arise, but currently I'm very happy with the unit. I've added a star (total of 5) based on my new findings. **", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Can't go wrong for the price!", "Author": "Benefit of the doubt", "ReviewID": "R29ZZPLSNDJH7N",

Can't go wrong for the price! Below is some useful information on the machine.Storage Card Data (Continuous Recording Mode):On continuous recording mode the DVR will breakup the recordings into 30 minute sections. I found the motion sensor is not to accurate and has too much delay to be trusted. Thus, I prefer continuous mode. One commenter mentioned getting 9 days of recording on a 32GB card. I have done multiple tests and that is just not the case: not even close.QVGA Data = .8GB's Per 1 Hour of Video = 40 Hours on 32GB SD CardQVGA Mode (lowest quality) will more then doubles the storage space and the image quality is not much different from the VGA mode (highest quality). See video for comparison. Testing results equated to about .8GB's per 1 hour of video footage. This equates to about 40 hours of continuous recordings on a 32GB card. On my test I got about 22 hours of footage which took up 17.8GB on the card. The files are easy to navigate (see attached image).VGA Data = 2GB's Per 1 Hour of Video = 16 Hours on 32GB SD CardVGA Mode (highest quality) uses a lot of space at about 2GB's per 1 hour of footage. This equates to about 16 hours of continuous recordings on a 32GB card. My test got about 2 hours of footage that took up over 4.16GB on the card. Not recommended.USB Card: Make sure to click \"safely remove hardware\" for the SD Card every time you use the card on the PC. If you do this the card will work flawlessly with the unit. You could also use Notebook to make a simple system.txt to improve the image quality (see J.P.'s review for more info).Menu: Pretty easy to navigate with wheel. Just make sure that you press the wheel into the unit while making selections (took me a while to figure out). See video for what the menu system looks like and how to use the wheel.Update: Once the video card fills up it will automatically erase the oldest file and replace with the current recording. If recording continuously, this gives you a backup of 40 hours at all times. This product is even better then I originally thought. Instead of having to erase the card every day or so, it does it automatically. That is not mentioned in the manual. COOL!

Understandable, but the seller probably should have spent a little extra time or money to translate it correctly.  The menu is very simple to maneuver but the buttons slider switch seems very delicate (I hope it doesn't break with constant use).I connected the DVR to a camera and it captured video in continuous recording format.  After pressing the function button, it places the recording on pause and will automatically continue recording after 10 seconds.  I wished it simply had a record \"on\" and \"off\" button instead of resuming the recording automatically after 10 seconds.  I would rather control when to record and when not to record.  I guess you can power it off to stop the recording.Keep a small  ball point pen handy because of the possibility of needing to press the reset button if it gets stuck and won't function.  This randomly happened when turning the device on or changing the settings.Now the audio feature.......  I tried connecting to my cable box (video out/audio out) and had to turn the cable box volume up extremely high to capture audio. Upon playback, the audio was garbled and not easy to hear.  I would have hoped I could also use this device as a type of recording device to capture video and audio, but the audio feature was a failure.Bottom line: The video recording feature succeeded and meets the need of storing many hours of video capture, but relying it to also capture audio might be a disappointment.", "Date": "February 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "A good little DVR", "Author": "J.

I wanted to know if the deer, rabbits, or neighbors were grazing when I wasn't looking.  It records decent resolution pictures and works for my intended use except that the motion sensor is not sensitive enough.  It requires motion within 10 feet of the camera to start recording--this might be a function of the camera I have--I'm not sure as I only have the one camera.  When I tried to set it up, I had it connected to a 15 inch lcd TV--the set up screen would not work--just a blank screen.

By default it's PAL.  No good for me.  I tried 15 frames per second, 24 fps, and 30fps.  30fps is smoothest but at the cost of image quality.  Apparently it has a data rate around 4Mbps.  So image quality is inversely tied to the frame rate you choose.  24fps seems the best compromise between quality and smoothness.  In fact, unless you're moving the camera really fast I doubt you could tell the difference.  I import these files into a computer so the 24fps is not an issue.  It might be a problem for some monitors, I'm not sure.I will be using this to record my r/c FPV flights in a video ground station as a secondary video source - the main being a gopro.  I like that it's small and portable.  The buttons don't feel very strong though.  However I will set it to continuous record and only use the button to stop the recording.

This allows plenty of time for the suspect to move away from the camera before video recording starts.You could use continues mode and get one photo per second at the expense of recording space.No sensitivity or masking is provided, so the units records more events than you may want.The video compression in VGA mode creates files of about 550mb per activation based on the size of movement, so even the maximum 32GB storage may be too small. In QVGA mode the quality is too low for face detection.The Video in and out connectors are low quality pin jacks and unreliable, bumping any wire may disable the recording without you knowing it.The manual is translated Chinese, give yourself plenty of time to figure out how to use it.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just a waist of time for me", "Author": "bad", "ReviewID": "R3I0G69ZM1UPL7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I couldn't get this product to work .

I like the fact that it is a solid metal shell, sturdy and compact. The control which is a push button dial is basic but serves it's function well enough. The menu and software is basic which is fine considering the price, nothing fancy just basic file selection then push the dial in for play and it will reply what it recorded. If it was on montion sensor then it would only play from the time it picked up motion to the time seconds after it senses no more changes in the background. The deal breaker for me was the motion detect. It has settings for continuous, stills and motion. The continuous is fine so if you do not plan on using the stills or motion detect your fine. I however wanted to maximize my microsd and not try to review 24 hrs of pure nothing so I wanted motion detect. It barely worked!! I tried different spy cams, same result. It will only sense massive changes in background so in other words, I can jump up and down and have my wife and I walk thru the view range and it will not record. However if I took the cam and gave it shaken baby syndrome or blocked the most of cam with my hand for about a few seconds, then it MAY record. By that time, the nanny/burglar/whoever would beat everyone senseless, eat a sandwich and then leave the house! I probably only get a pic of the show out the door by then WTH!. I really was hoping this would work out but it looks like I will have to buy a full size DVR unit 4 channel and run some lines.Oh, did I mention it came with Euro power supply plug? They included an adapter but by the time you plug it all in, The stack is about 5 inches high or so, not including the power strip. Yea...It does support up to 32 gb microSD and the motion detect was the unit. I have good cameras (600 TVL)and while the pic is fine, it's the motion detect that kills this. Still images are fine, but if someone sneaks in and out of frame in less than a few seconds...it would miss them. I tried..it did not catch me walking from the doorway into the master bath and back out.1/21/14 - I guess a couple promoters of this product disagrees with me", "Date": "September 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Does not work - No Power", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R27ADGW2NSKBPL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Finally received item from my shipping agent.
