I was looking for a DVR System and I was searching for a couple of days to find one that was of good qaulity and reasonalby priced, and when I came across this product I thought wow this is what Im looking for and this DVR System also has a 1TB hard drive.  When I recieved it I was wondering why the weight of it was so light? when I opened the box I realized that this system did not come with any cameras at all??? I was so disapointed that I just put it back in the packaging box and went and sat down to process what I just received.  I saw this same brand Samsung  but the DVR system Hard drive was a 500 GB and it had 4 cameras and cables let just say it was fully equiped for $349.00 around Christmas time and now they are selling the same system for $299.00. So I was fuming because I assumed that this system also came with cameras!  I paid $479.00 for this system and there is no cameras?  So I emailed the company to let them know that I was diisapointed about paying so much for this and their was no cameras!! They emailed me back as if I should of known that.  A few days later I take it out of the packaging box and open the box that the DVR System was packed in and on the side of the box the made a label that said the system was a SRD-440-1TB and covered the original label up wich clearly showed that what was in the box was a Samsung 500GB DVR System!!!  WTF?? so open the box and looked at the model label on the system and lo and behold sure enough this was a Samsung 500GB DVR System!!  So I emailed the company again and told them that this was not the system that I orderd and how dissapointed I was.  They emailed me back and told me that Samsung has the right to take their products and switched them and put a 1TB into a DVR system that was originally a 500GB and sell the product as is. What?  so basically they are trying to tell me that the model in the box that cleary shows the model name and number was a 500 GB that Samsung can refurbish it and make it into a 1TB and not even change the model number on the DVR system and slap a label on the outside of the box and say it was a 1TB DVR System. I don't think that Samsung Did this at all I truely beleive that this company I bought it from did this and jacked up the price and was hopeing that I was a very dumb consumer and that I wouldn't know the difference!  Well I made sure Amazon was aware of what was going on and I returned this product for a refund.  Well they refunded me and when the refund hit they SHORTED me almost a $100.00 dollars!!! Can you believe that WOW.  So I had to email them again to let them know they shorted me and finally I received the rest of my refund. This was a very bad experience and I am pretty sure that this company was hoping that I was a consumer that didn't pay attention and that they could double their money. So Beware consumers Beware!!", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$620.00", "Features": "A quality product by Samsung", "Name": "Samsung SRD-440-1TB Digital Video Recorder - 1 TB HDD", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/311E9DsLVjL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007T99IS0"}}
