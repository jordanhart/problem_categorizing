I've even had success catching would-be thieves in the complete dark. The it's not lacking any features, and the improvements and services Swann is adding just sweeten the deal.Setup is simple enough- though I am somewhat of a techie. It includes a mouse for interaction with the UI, and you can even plug a usb keyboard in to make things easier. I've found, though, that connecting to the device on my computer and running the \"NetViewer\" app that is included makes setting it up way easier.New features include a dynamic dns service called \"Swann DVR\", free for customers, makes it much easier to open up your system outside your network for use with smartphones and web browsers wherever you might be. With a bit of port forwarding within my router, you can set it up with all your devices quite simply. Their customer service is very helpful with this as well, even taking control of your computer and configuring everything for you.The motion sensing features, along with the \"night vision\", make this an extremely efficient system. Just set it to only record when it senses motion (you can even specify where on screen to look, so if there's a tree that always moves or cars that go by it knows to ignore that area). This means I can just glance if there are any recordings, and if there are, I know something happened and I check it out. No more running through hours of footage just to see if something happened.The included cameras have good video quality, but if you're looking for very powerful night vision, just buy a separate camera to plug into the BNC port in the back. It's couldn't be more simple. You can even buy a \"PTZ\" (Pan, tilt, zoom) camera in case you want to want to control the camera wherever you are.Pros-Great quality-Great price-Good cameras-Plenty of features-Helpful supportCons-Night vision is only 33 feet with the included cameras-DVR UI can be confusingOverall it's a great unit for serious security or just peace of mind.

It seems to be a good unit for the money.  I use the Swann app on my Samsung Galaxy S III, not as intuitive as you'd like but it gets the job done for free.I would like to focus on some install and setup issues.For the phone app, if your DVR password is longer than 6 characters the whole password is not necessary, only enter the first 6 characters (this took forever to discover, very painful).  Also, the app/DVR only supports 4 cameras at a time for this model, so even though you get 8 cameras with this unit (2250), you can only view 4 at a time.  It's easy to switch to other cameras, but you get an error message when trying to access more than four at a time.I did set up port forwarding on my Linksys router (I ran a cat5 cable to the DVR), this enabled me to view my cameras on my desktop and will aide in setting up the more intricate details.  This .pdf helped with that process... do a google search for \"swann view easy setup DVR8 I6-8500\", should be the first to pop up.My wife has an I-phone/pad/pod (#ridiculous), so this should help those out there with \"those\" gadgets... google search \"swannview for iphone\"I ran all my cables through the attic, my daughter helped (small person). I connected the DVR RCA out to my 60\" TV...so I can just switch the input and view my cameras if needed, no additional monitor necessary.Additionally, if all your cameras don't appear, or you see \"signal lost\"...you might have a power issue, try adjusting your DVR power supply setup.Finally, the manual that comes with the unit is printed poorly in black and white, many of the images are of poor quality.  Go to Swann.com, DVRs and Monitoring kits, then scroll down for the DVR8-2550...there are a few there, just find yours.I hope it helps, maybe it will save you some stress.

It was purchased primarily to keep an eye on my front porch (we had some UPS packages stolen) and to track comings-and-going while we're out of town.For what we paid ($200), it's a pretty decent system.  It came with all of the essential parts -- cameras, camera mounts, cables, mounting screws, mouse, power adapter, DVR, etc.  If you're buying this system, I'd recommend that you pick up some quality wood screws (the heads snapped off the ones provided), a BNC-male to RCA-female adapter and long RCA cable (for running the output to a TV), an extension USB cable (so you can use a mouse at the TV, if the DVR is hidden), a few boxes of coax staples (for securing various wires to walls), and a backup power supply (the unit doesn't recover well from power failures).  I also bought an infrared repeater kit, so I could use the remote control at the TV (the DVR is hidden).The DVR has a surprising number of features -- motion activated recording, identifying only certain areas for motion sensitivity (handy if you don't want tree branches setting it off), the ability to access the device from a smartphone or computer running Internet Explorer (all in all, very easy to setup if your router supports UPnP, and Swann provides a free DDNS service), video/camera settings, supports different users, reboot schedules, etc.  The downside is the interface is very clunky and feels like an IT system ca. 1992.  The documentation is also pretty bad: Paragraphs will randomly end in mid sentence, you'll be referred to pages that don't exist, incorrect/inconsistent terminology is used, etc.The cameras work surprisingly well and even though the provided cables were definitely cheap, I didn't have any issues with ground loop interference or broken couplings.  The mounts are cheap but effective.  You'll just want to use your own screws, since the ones provided are incredibly fragile.If you want a kit, with everything provided, this isn't a bad system, especially if you can get it on sale.  Though, to be honest, if I were to do it all over again, I'd probably get a bare bones 8 channel DVR, buy my own hard drive, and then incrementally buy cables and cameras.  In the long run, I think it would be cheaper and easier, since I'll probably wind up upgrading the cameras and using shielded (coax) cables eventually.*****ONE YEAR UPDATE*****The system is still going strong.  I've upgraded two of the cameras to vandal proof domes with a wide angle lens and am much happier.  The cameras that come with the system, in comparison, are like looking through paper towel tubes.  For what I paid, I'm still happy with the purchase.  I did wind up running cat5 to the cameras, instead of the provided cables in order to future proof myself.  If/when this DVR dies, I'll probably go the digital route.For what this system costs now, if you're not planning on using all of the available channels right away, anyways...  Do yourself a favor and buy a higher quality DVR and one or two nice cameras, and then gradually install new cameras.  The all-in-one kits are handy but IMO, aren't really worth it when you factor in the cheap cameras, cables, and mounts.", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "pretty good", "Author": "wildcon", "ReviewID": "R1O6QL074MKJ9V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Camera system works great in motion detection and the daytime picture quaility if great.

I replaced it with this almost identical model and it's been running non-stop for over a month.It's important to set expectations though: be aware that you're not going to get fantastic image quality. It's adequate, but not much more. I wish the cameras were a little more wide angle - they have to mounted a fair distance away if you want to cover a broad area - for example - one camera mounted in the eaves above the driveway will not capture a view of the whole driveway unless you can set them farther back.Decent quality, great value - I liked it enough to buy a second after I moved.", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Second one - and died after less than 3 months", "Author": "rotwylrsrgr8", "ReviewID": "R1CRZGBFNDD5D2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had a previous version that worked for years and then the hard drive died.

The system comes with a 500GB DVR, 8 security cameras, a remote control unit, a mouse, and all cables/connectors required to connect the system. The setup is very easy and the cameras provide excellent day time visibility and good night time visibility (up to 20 feet wit dim light at night). The cameras are not too big and they are not too small. You can simultaneously record up to 8 cameras on the DVR for up to 30 days in continuous recording mode - even longer in motion detection recording mode.There are (4) four ways to access and/or monitor the DVR and camera system: (1) From the console itself. (2) From the remote control unit. (3) From a computer on your home network (LAN) or a computer on the internet WAN (by installing the Swann PC software). (4) From a mobile device (Blackberry, PDA, or other mobile device that supports 3G) by downloading the Swann mobile device software. I tested all (4) methods to access the DVR and I was able to access the camera system locally (as part of a LAN) as well as over the internet using an internet computer and my mobile device (Blackberry) over the 3G network.The Swann instructions are not that good but sufficient enough if you have a basic knowledge of how to use a VCR/DVD recorder/player. The hardest part of the set up was configuring the system for remote access using my Blackberry mobile device. Since Swann does not provide step-by-step instructions on how to setup a mobile device (too many devices on the market),  I provide step-by-step instructions on how to remotely connect a Blackberry 9370 Smartphone to the Swann DVR but Amazon.com will not allow me to publish the website address of my instruction page. Therefore, I can't even tell you the website address.What I can say is that the most important parts of setting up mobile access are: (1) Ensuring that UPnP is enabled on the DVR itself (2) Enabling \"Port Forwarding\" on your router with the proper IP Addresses and TCP/UDP protocols (3) Identifying the correct port numbers in the router and on your mobile device. Swann Customer Support can assist you if you do not have basic computer networking knowledge (Private IP address vs Public IP Address, Port Forwarding, TCP/UDP protocols, Port addresses, etc...)The bottom line is that this product gets 5 STARS from me because it does EVERYTHING that it says it is suppose to do and it costs under $400.

No complaints.We hooked the system up to an older monitor we have, no issues there, no keyboard support means you're entering text using an on screen keyboard and the mouse, but it's not a big deal.

The mounting system on the more expensive model looks much more professional. This Swann system mounts to a wall, then requires you to drill a hole for the camera wires to go through to the DVR. On the model I purchased for my mom (unfortunately I forget the model number, but I know it was Swann.) You actually drilled a quarter inch hole in the mounting surface, then screwed the camera into the mounting surfaces, and the camera wiring went from the camera mount to the dvr. The big advantage here is that it looks way more professional, and that there are NO EXPOSED WIRES. With the method this camera system uses you're going to have exposed wires and require some grommets to fill the holes you just drilled in your house/business.2. The night vision is horrible compared to the more expensive IR model.These two reasons alone make me wish I had purchased the same model as I got for my mom.

My biggest gripe is that it doesn't allow you to scan the alarm log (motion detect events)  for a specific camera or a time period.  So you are forced to start at the beginning (or end) of a possibly large log for a certain day, and  shuffle through it by clicking \"next\" (or \"previous\"), 8 entries at a time.  There is no indication in the log for the camera that caused the alarm, so you have to look at them all.Another example  of poor design decisions is in the interplay of \"full time\" and \"alarm only\" video recording.  If a busy camera is set to record all the time during the day, and then only on alarm (motion) events after hours, you still get many many alarm events in the log during the day.  And these are mixed in with alarm events from other cameras that are only operated by motion.  It makes it hard to scan the log for meaningful events from these alarm-only cameras.  It would have been much better if the logging of alarm events during \"full time\" recording was a user choice.  Even just identifying the camera causing the alarm (see above) would have helped.In one situation, the control software is really clumsy.  If you are setting up a camera to record on a schedule, you select \"schedule mode\" on the \"recording\" screen for the  camera, and then select \"schedule\" to actually set up the schedule\". Even though you may have been configuring camera 3, you are always presented with the schedule for camera 1.  You must select camera 3 again.  I have mistakenly set the schedule for camera 1 on more than one occasion.  Not a big deal, and it was my fault because I didn't pay close enough attention.  It just is not intuitive. even though everything is labelled.On the other hand, the connection to the time server is easy to set up.  The time server is absolutely necessary because the internal clock drifts.", "Date": "June 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent Swann", "Author": "andy999", "ReviewID": "R1L38IU831TA2T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very excellent product and good service.recommend this product .love it will buy again.anytime u need Swann service they will help u n guide u all the way,", "Date": "June 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Doesn't work with iPad", "Author": "Bob C \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "R1DZD46GKULZ4R", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Works well as a security system.

I had a remote monitor that could hook into the camera and took it into a dark closet and powered it up. I could see really good, but only about 10 feet.  Considering the camera would be mounted about 8 to 10 feet up, how far do you think it could see?

I cannot set up my kids i-phones or my parents devices to just view as a restricted user.3) Cameras are okay in light, but poor in low light.  Close up, such as inside in the dark you can make out and possibly identify a person.  They are very poor in the dark outside, very snowy and nearly impossible to see anything more than ten feet away.4) The manual was not clear nor helpful at all for more difficult things setting up email and alarm notifications5) Don't try to set it up using the remote PC Swanview app as it has limited functionality, use the mouse & monitor on the DVR itself.  The thing that got me was that I couldn't see which camera was triggering the motion recording as it doesn't show up on Swannview.  Once I looked on the DVR it marked the offending camera with a M (for motion), then I could adjust the sensitivity6) Amazon has removed the free Swannview app for Kindle.  Before I bought this system I checked & it was there, after I bought the system it disappeared and links you to some \"IP Cam Viewer\" for $3.99.  If you have a Kindle Fire you can go to Google apps and do a round-a-bout install and get the better free Swann app, but if you have a base Kindle you are stuck.Things that I liked:1) Tech support was fast, friendly and very helpful.2) Learning how to set up recording modes was fairly easy3) DNS setup was easy and free through Swann4) I can add better cameras as I can afford them, but for now I have the system up and running.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for price", "Author": "Jeremy Willis", "ReviewID": "R1VTQUZD468E7G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great value for the price.

Hoyer \"RH\"", "ReviewID": "RP2DYB25UWEI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased this product when Amazon had it on their Gold Box.  It is quite a deal for $199.  The setup of the DVR and cameras was quite easy along with the initial configuration.  Swann recommends that you use a router with uPnP (Plug and Play) configuration, but provides for routers that do not have this configuration.  I am in an all Apple environment with an Apple Extreme Router, Macintosh computer, with iPhone and iPad.  The Apple Extreme does not have uPnP included, so I was concerned.  It requires that it be configured with port forwarding  and the Apple Extreme does not support this mode.  The configuration is far from simple and I would call it very complex.One of the best things about this Swann system is their support.  On the Amazon site it says that \"Excellent\" support is provided, and indeed that is the case.  I certainly give them five stars for their support and more!  They were able to log on to my Macintosh computer remotely and assist with the configuration of Safari on the computer, the configuration of all the port forwarding on the router, and final configuration necessary for the DVR itself.I would say that they included documentation is less than satisfactory.  It would be nice to have a step by step process for the setup and configuration for the internet.  But the lack of adequate documentation is more than made up by their super telephone support.  I would certainly recommend that if you get one of these units, that you do the basic set up and then call for assistance with the computer, router, and DVR configuration.  It will save you a lot of grief.I would now say that this would have been a good product at the regular price on Amazon and it was only better because I happened to find it on their Gold Box deals.So YES, it does work in an Apple environment with all apple equipment.  I presume that there is no problem with a pc and windows setup, but apple is always a little more problematic with outside vendors.By the way, the DVR is quite simple to use and does a good job with the pictures.

I decided to set this up after my last security system had been destroyed by mongo running it over with his rascal. I felt that in a town like eureka with about 20 people here I wouldn't need it, but who knows where I will be next week and then it might be too late. Anyhoo installation was successful and easy. I couldn't wait to try it out and through out the day I sat and watched; swiching cameras and seeing people come and go. Then as night fell I noticed something peculiar. There was someone dancing in what appeared to be a horsehead and loin cloth around my trailer. He started on camera two then moved to three, back to two and finally stopped at one. There he stood staring into my camera with his dead horse head eyes. It creaped me out I had to get away from the screen. I tried looking outside but it was too dark to see and mongo and eugene went into town to celebrate the annoucement of a new star wars movie. I went back to the tv screen and the horse head man was gone from camera one. I started flipping through the cameras and he was on camera four so close to it that all you could make out was one giant eye! I started freaking out how was I going to get out of here; I quickly called the police. As soon as they heard I was from the carnival and that a man with a horse head was stalking me they just laughed and hung up the phone on me. right now I am hiding under the bed and I can hear the horse head man walking on top of my trailer. If I make it out of here alive I will let you know....", "Date": "October 31, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "View & record 4 channels of high quality video simultaneously in real time\nIncludes 4 weather resistant, clear resolution 400TVL cameras with powerful night vision to 33ft/10m\nSet & forget by recording continuously from 4 cameras for 120 days+ onto a massive 500GB hard drive, even longer with motion detection\nSurveillance in the palm or your hand with live viewing on 3G enabled Smartphone including iPhone, iPad, Android, BlackBerry, Windows Mobile 6, Symbian OS and more*, with remote notification via email\nSave time & have peace of mind by easily locating incident video, then transfer to USB flash drive", "Name": "Swann 4-Channel DVR4-2550 and 4x ADS-180 CMOS SWDVK-425504C Cameras", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rbKDIQ%2B1L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0058W5RQW"}}
