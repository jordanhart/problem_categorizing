This product didn't just meet my expectations but far exceeded.  Cameras do need a little help at night when it comes to the IR side but what do you really expect at this price point.  Easy to set up and install.  The operations is a bit more complex when the instructions that come with it suck so bad but a few days you'll have it all figured out.I wouldn't just recommend this system, I would instruct you to make this your purchase.
