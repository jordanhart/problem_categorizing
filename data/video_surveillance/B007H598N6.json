First you need to shore up the handle locking devices and then you need to add weights to the picture.  Aside from the weights, 1 trip to Lowes is all you need for all of the new parts.Locking devices.  Aside from the pivot point on the 2-part handle system at the back of this rig, remove both the plastic knobs and the carriage bolts that hold all three handle assemblies.  Replace them with the following: (ensure you retain the clear rubber washers!)1/4-20 2 Inch hex bolts. Can be full thread or partial.  Both will fit.1/4-20 Wing nuts.I bought 5 bolts and 6 wing nuts.Make sure that when you are putting everything back together you put the rubber washers back where they were!!  The first time you tighten this new locking system down you will notice the difference.  The previous system is just plain shoddy.To secure weights to the rig (great for balance and comfort when using it in the shoulder rig configuration and maybe for other uses but I haven't found any yet):On the same trip to Lowes:1/4-20 4 inch or longer hex bolt.  This will screw into the bottom of the 2-part handle bit at the back.Washers large enough to hold your weights on to both the rig and the wing nut (explained later)Go to Walmart and get yourself at least 1 x 2.5lb kettle weight and 1 x 5lb kettle weight.  Make sure they are disc-type.The order of assembly for the weights.Take the bolt and screw on a wing-nut (wings should be toward the open end of the bolt not the hex end)Put 2 x washers on the bolt and slide down to the wing nutPut weights on the bolt to suit your needs2 more washers on the boltHold everything together and screw the bolt into the rear of the rig.  The inside is hollow so you will not hit a \"stop\".  Instead I recommend screwing down about 1.5 inches or so to ensure you are using all of the available threads.Tighten the wing nut down to the washers and lock everything in place.Tada!  Instantly stable shoulder rig and whever else you can think of.PS:  Throw the plastic crap fasteners in the trash so you won't be tempted to ever use them.After these modifications I am more than impressed by this rig, and for the price it just can't be beat.  Especially when under $20 and a little ingenuity solves any real issues.Would have given 5 stars if I didn't need to fix those small issues.", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Stabilization!", "Author": "S.

I bought it for use with my Canon T2i for filming stabilization and let me tell you for the  price (compared to other high end steady cams) you can't beat this product. It is very lightweight, compactable and versatile. So it has exceeded my expectations. The shipping was fast, the price was affordable and the product was just as described.

Let me mention the cons first though because I know that's what anybody reading this is looking for.Its modular setup is awesome and makes a lot of sense, but it is pretty annoying if you need to shoot quickly or if you need to change the set up. It's not too bad going from one position to another, but if you're going from fully-closed to a shoulder support position, don't plan on it being quick.The other thing that I'm not too keen on is when you're in the shoulder support position, it places the camera (I shoot on a DSLR) a little too far away and a little too low. It would be perfect positioning if you use an external monitor.All of that being said, I really like this rig. It's very compact when collapsed and surprisingly light for how supportive it is. The different setup options are nice and I've actually been able to use many of them. You can also adjust this rig to fit whatever you need.There are 1/4\" screw holes everywhere, so you can attach tons of external components, such as mics or flashes, to the rig. The one issue there is that they're all on moving parts, so you'll likely have to remove those pieces before changing your setup.All in all, you can't beat this product for the price. It's a versatile rig with great support and functionality. I would highly recommend this rig, especially if you're on a budget.", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Get It, and Don't Look Back!!!!", "Author": "J.Robinson", "ReviewID": "RHTWVO16CYBCD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've seen plenty of camera rigs for more money but I couldn't afford them!

I don't think it's made of metal though, it seems to be some sort of plastic, so I'll have to wait and see just how durable it is. I changed some of the plastic nuts to metal wing nuts (please note that the nuts and bolts situated throughout this rig are comprised of BOTH US AND Imperial sizes, so you may have to actually take the unit to the hardware store to get the correct nuts matched). I interchange two cameras on it. Two Canon HF S200's. One with a Raynox wide angle lens and the other with a Letus mini adapter. It's pretty heavy with the latter camera attached, but the former seems like the perfect size/weight ratio.

My first one broke and it was slightly bigger and more heavy duty so I'm a little worried about this one. When you extend the shoulder slide part all the way and add weight to the back the plastic connector in the middle cant handle the stress and literally split. So for this one when using weights on the back I'll make a point not to extend the shoulder slide all the way.(sacrificing comfort and having the viewfinder a little close for my taste)", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "UNRELIABLE", "Author": "Dan", "ReviewID": "R24M4RGI1DQ83X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This rig has fallen apart at every junction that this rig is needed to work.

It has lots of mounting points for accessories and can be folded into a very small volume for storage or transport.Yes, as other reviewers have complained, it's possible to over torque the adjustment knobs.  But that's true of any mechanical appliance.  Use common sense.  If you don't know what \"finger tight\" means, get a lesson from someone who does.  And if you strip a knob, it's not the end of the world.  1/4-20 fittings can be found in any hardware store.If you'd rather pay four times as much for a \"Professional\" model, that's fine.
