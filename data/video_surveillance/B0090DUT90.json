I had 4ch DVR before with 4 bullet cameras, and needless to say: when you are cheap, you pay twice! This is finally it: 8ch/cameras cover single family house territory completely! All cameras are very good quality, deliver crisp image, true  colors. Dome cameras have wider angle, very good for the back yard. Bullet shows little closer image, good for entrance doors, gates. DVR is a bit complicated to set up, specially if you do it with the remote. Took me couple calls to customer service to set up network and mobile surveillance and couple additional calls to set up my PTZ :) Otherwise, all good.", "Date": "August 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works great", "Author": "Terry Hill", "ReviewID": "R36A1S1QFINX1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The only problem I had was the wires were just a little short on a couple of cameras.  When I measured them they should have worked out but a couple were just 2' shorter than advertised.  So I moved on camera closer and then ordered a 100ft wire for the other.", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "George's 8 cameras", "Author": "George Perich \"Penjun\"", "ReviewID": "R1CVDINEDUN5YJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best you can buy, works super, Have 8 working, wires need to be longer,Had to have 2 men run wires & it took them 6hrs.
