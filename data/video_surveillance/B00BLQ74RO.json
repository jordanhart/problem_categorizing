They were exactly as described and pictured. I had to bend in around dozens of corners while installing around my house, and the video quality was still perfect! I honestly didn't expect how clear it was, since previous cables always gave me low quality video. The electrical power through the attached AWG cord is also very stable. This product exceeded my expectations. These cables are very cheap, absolutely worth the money I spent. This product is a must own.", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "worked", "Author": "Tod Morrow", "ReviewID": "R2Y6V7RHPLVO4A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it was what i expected and worked just fine. we hooked up a bunch of cameras in a large facility", "Date": "February 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Value", "Author": "J.
