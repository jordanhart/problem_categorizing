Zmodo support was very helpful and I would recommend them if you have any issues with this system. Otherwise this system is a great for the price.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Daylight Surveillance System - Not for nighttime surveillance.", "Author": "LJ \"LJ\"", "ReviewID": "RE454A0BLQPA4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Good day videos when 960h enhanced is selected in the menu. Nighttime shots w/night vision are very bad. If you need a surveillance system to be able to view the surrounding areas of your home or business during the day and you don't need a lot of detail like facial recognition, then this will work for you. As far as nighttime, videos are to grainy to be any good to anyone, especially law enforcement. The alarm feature works very good. It beeps loudly when motion is detected. It works well for people walking on you property, but it can be a little late for cars. The playback usually shows the vehicle well pass the middle of the screen. If you need more video detail or you need to be able to see people moving around more than 15 feet from the camera, try another brand. FYI: 960h looks a little like dvd or 8mm video. It is analog, not digital. Good daytime colors with not much detail or resolution. I'm going to try using motion lights to improve the night vision.", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GG0TCQG"}}
