{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Product but Product Support is Awful", "Author": "Charles", "ReviewID": "R4AHYZ7BJKXYI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought and installed this product for one of my customer specifically for HDMI Monitor support.  Product was installed, setup and ran flawlessly for about 30 days.  Then, HDMi port failed and I needed to call Night Owl Customer support. After calling and holding for about an hour to speak to a customer support rep, it was determined that DVR need to sent in for repair.  I then filled our the requisite RMA request assuming that the request will processed promptly.  After waiting for three days, sent an email requesting status, received timely response stating that the RMA request was authorized and that the RMA shipping information will be sent in a few days.... This is the third day and counting but still no RMA return email.  I am still waiting and will call on Monday, 4/13/14 to request status RMA return shipping information.  Given that I am beyond the 30 day Amazon replace timeframe and my customer is still down, I might have to order another Night Owl DVR in order to get my customer back up and running.  This is third Night Owl system that I have installed and they all have worked well but their customer support is Awful.", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EDU50U8"}}
