This product is a very good value.  I have installed 4 of these for myself and friends and all are working great. I buy them from my local Sams club store for $399.00. I like the familiar brand name and the 3 year warranty. Also I buy the 500 gb model and add another 1T hard drive if needed. The cameras are Samsung's newer models and work great especially during the day. Night Vision range is limited due to the low powered LED's. I always set the recording quality to the highest setting and the resolution to 4cif at 7fps. This gives me about 2 weeks (depending on the amount of motion the camera sees) of stored video on a 500gb hard drive. Outdoor cameras will pick up more motion due to insects at night.  I keep my motion sensitivity at 5 (halfway up). I always recommend using the mouse instead of the remote because it us much easier to manuver around the menues. The backup to the memory stick is easy to do and the remote software works great on my Windows 7 desktop.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "its ok  not what I expected from samsung", "Author": "thomas spears", "ReviewID": "R3GYAAC8JP21DK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The reason is number one the way it was the way it was wrapped not in a box but with brown paper the bx was damaged everything inside looked to be ok  the second  is high resolution it supposed to be well if you call 358x246 high resolution then ok when you play back it skips the frame also when you move it is like it takes a second to catch up like the old karate movies. I had high expectations for this unit. I should have looked around and done my home work .besides that the unit is easy to set up . The 4 add on mics are nice especially for the money sound is clear and good .if you want simple with no options and not so good night vision then this is for you but if you want to add on a ptz camera forget it . Even the zmodo have them I have everything samsung and quite happy with all my electronic s but tbis one I am very disappointed I have tried everything to get better picture quality no luck and the funny thing is I guess this one was supposed togo to walmart it even said it on the package slip you will save almost 200 dallors buying ad Amazon then walmart .", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Samsung V4040N 8 Channel", "Author": "akbearpaw", "ReviewID": "R2CQ88LYMBET4J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like the product but do not think I am utilizing all its capabilities, because the documentation is barely adequate.
