It is time intensive to run the wires, but that is any system. This system is a bargain. I got the 8ch 700tvl domes, and could not be happier with the quality and low price. I am also pleased with the instruction ,and dvr. One cable was bad.hopefully the company will send another free of charge. The plug and play option cuts the technical installation time considerably. No port forwarding necessary for smart phone monitoring.", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GSA9CIC"}}
