{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Surprised!!", "Author": "Ella's mom", "ReviewID": "R11Y953B5V6HAY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After some intense research I decided to purchase this Samsung video monitor. I was skeptical due to the fact I couldn't test it before purchasing it. I've read reviews on other products of grainy screens, poor sound, interference with wireless modems etc. The fact is, this is the best purchase for a video baby monitor. I can't believe it was only $169. I've looked at other models in the $250-$300+ and not nearly as compatible.Pros- The picture is amazing. I do photography so I am very particular when it comes to resolution and clarity.The night view is wonderful- you can change the contrast and not grainy at all.On the camera you can set the sensitivity level as well as the volume for the music and voice intercom.There are two zoom levels, they are both very clear.From the hand held screen, you can activate the music in the nursery without going in the room, as well as turn on/off the night light.The temperature reading-I read another review stating it reads about 10 degrees warmer on this model- ours has been accurate.There is barely any delay-really it's about 1 second off.The battery life is fair- what I expected for a 3.5 inch screen. It will beep three times when you need to plug it in.You have the option of a beep or vibrate for the voice activation.You can set the screen on a timer- it will go off, but activate when she makes a noise or moves- I have it set on the more sensitive side.The intercom is great- my husband said it was very clear and she recognized my voice.CONS- there is not a single thing wrong with this model. (The more expensive Samsung models have a pan option- I have the camera on the wall in a corner and can see the entire nursery (12x14)and zoom in on the crib. Pan not needed!)A MUST BUY you will not be disappointed. I am very particular about the items I write reviews on. I hope this helps you make an educated decision on your purchase. Good luck!!Amazon is a plus- 2 day shipping, arrived the next day!", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "HOPEFULLY THIS WILL SAVE YOU SOME HEADACHES", "Author": "Mom", "ReviewID": "R2MV44PSP02VD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So I will start with the fact that I have purchased 4 different monitors :1) 2.4GHz DIGITAL WIRELESS BABY VIDEO MONITOR SYSTEM WITH NIGHT VISION -- 2.4\" Color LCD Screen (Two-way Radio communication) by Smart AV ,2) MOBICAM DXR DIGITAL MONITORING SYSTEM,3) SAMSUNG WIRELESS VIDEO SECURITY MONITORING SYSTEM w/ 3.5\" LCD,4) SUMMER INFANT BABY TOUCH COLOR VIDEO MONITOR by Summer infant. I have a 3yr. old and I was still using my Sony baby call monitor which I still love, but now I need to see when she gets out of her bed and I wanted the two way feature \"talk to the baby feature\" so I could talk to her and tell her to get back in her bed. I should also say that I want to see as much of her room around her bed as I could her room is 11 ft. by 12ft I put the camera in the corner on a shelf eight feet off the ground about 10 and \u00bd ft away from her bed, so if she got out of her bed I could see where she was. I could also see her during the day playing in her room. Well, let me say that they at least at this moment they don't make a monitor with a 100% \"clear\" picture for day and night vision. First up, I bought the 2.4 GHz MONITOR by SMART AV: It was good I could see her ok during the day, and at night with the night vision and I could hear her and she could hear me when I talked on it.CONS: Not the best picture but it was good enough. The camera did not adjust down far enough I had to put a coaster under the back half to get it to angle down some more and no sound bar (the lights that light up according to how noisy it is in the room). The big problem was it did not have the rechargeable batteries the other reviewers said it had. (Amazon told me it was probably because they bought it from a different seller not DBroth.) You can put regular batteries in it but if you want to plug it in you have to remove the batteries first. I tried to purchase the rechargeable batteries from them it has been a week and a half they still have not answered my emails. I returned it. Update: I never received a response. Next up, the MOBICAM DXR DIGITAL MONITORING SYSTEM: it had a ok picture during the day a little grainy but you could see. Night vision was grainy but ok.CONS: No sound bar, grainy day and night vision, when you touch the talk button to speak to the child it did not always work I would have to let it go and press it again to get it to work. I had it replaced with a new one thinking it might have been that one and the new one did the same thing. I called Amazon and they said they are not selling these directly anymore because of that happening to the batch of these they had maybe a bad batch they are investigating it, but you can still buy it from third party sellers on Amazon. UPDATE: Amazon is now selling them again. Next up, was the SAMSUNG WIRELESS VIDEO SECURITY MONITORING SYSTEM w/ 3.5\" LCD: this one had the best picture of them all but only for during the day (although it had a yellow glow at the top of the screen from the light in the room but the light was not in the cameras view I adjusted the camera down even further and it still remained. It has a nice night light and music that you can turn on and off from the monitor. I really, really wanted to like it.CONS: The camera did not adjust down far enough for me on my shelf, so I put a coaster under the back half to angle it down some more, There were also some \"delays\" (like when walking or just moving fast the screen would \"miss some frames/some of the movement\" in the picture.) The temperature gauge was not correct, the alarm for detection of sound in the room was a pain to adjust, I did not like that when It went in to sleep mode (the screen goes black to power save) the volume would shut off, till it heard a sound, I wanted it on unless I turned it down, (which is how the baby touch monitor operates in sleep mode the sound does not shut off but you can turn it down if you wish), the zoom function was a BIG pain you have to go into the menu out of the \"picture screen\" and put it on zoom then go back to the \"picture screen\", the volume was not very loud at all my husband was like it doesn`t turn up louder than that?  The \"talk to the baby\" function was \"choppy\"(not as clear as the summer infant baby touch) and my absolute deal breaker was, I would think the MAIN REASON you would purchase a monitor like this the night vision: at night with and without a night light on in the room I could barely see anything much less my daughter in her bed you would really have to stare and look good to make any thing out, the infrared led's must not be strong at all. (If you want it for close up it might work I don't know never tested close up tested all of them in the same place about 10 and 1/2 feet away from her bed up on a shelf I need to see at least part of the room around her bed.) I was so aggravated by this search, I printed out a twenty percent off coupon from the internet for Babies R Us and went and bought the SUMMER INFANT BABY TOUCH MONITOR,  the new one they have with the touch screen monitor and pan and zoom camera. I put it to the test compared it to the SAMSUNG and MOBI. My two most important things were the night vision to see her at night and the \"talk to the baby\" function so I could talk to her. This summer infant model has a secure private connection unlike the other summer infant monitors. Its picture is ok (not HD but none of them are) slightly, slightly, slightly grainy during the day but still really good, and its night vision although a little grainy was the best out of all of them for the distance, (again I did not test close up) plus I can move the camera around remotely from the monitor to see where she's at in the room and I can zoom in easily the functions appear below and to the right of the picture when you touch the screen although the closer you zoom in the grainier it got but that was with ALL of the models I tested. AFTER A LOT OF TESTING AND DEBATE, I RETURNED THEM ALL EXCEPT FOR THE SUMMER INFANT BABY TOUCH MONITOR. I really like it. I am glad I just went ahead and spent a little more money and bought it. The pan and zoom features work great. (THIS IS THE ONLY MONITOR OUT OF THE ONES I TESTED THAT HAS THE ACTUAL PAN FEATURE. THE ABILITY TO MOVE THE CAMERA AROUND THE ROOM REMOTELY FROM THE CONTROLS ON THE MONITOR. The Samsung does not have the pan feature.) I can see her WHOLE room day or night. After a certain amount of time it goes into power save mode when it is not on the charger and turns off the picture but you can still hear the sound you can still adjust the volume and if you want to see the picture again just press the button on the top. If it is on the charger the picture will stay on unless you press the button on the top to turn the screen back off. The monitor has a lithium-ion battery and the camera has the option to put regular batteries in it if you can not plug it in a outlet. The monitor also has a belt clip that doubles as the stand for it when the monitor is not on the charger. I called summer infant to ask about recommendations for the rechargeable battery for the monitor the company says not to charge the battery more than eight hours and let it run down before you put it back on the charger for maximum battery life.UPDATE: IT HAS BEEN TWO YEARS.I have since purchased a second extra camera so I can watch her in the play room too I love it.I STILL USE IT EVERYNIGHT. I HAVE NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT AT ALL. I THINK I SHOULD JUST MENTION. I ALSO HAVE NOT DROPPED OR POSSIBLY DAMAGED MINE IN ANYWAY.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pleasantly surprised!", "Author": "Josh Herod", "ReviewID": "RGOF0MFQ28QGE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Was a bit hesitant buying this monitor given the fairly reasonable price as compared with other monitors with comparable features.  However, we've been nothing but impressed by this unit. For the money, you can't go wrong! We've been using it exclusively as a baby monitor, though it's not limited to just that.Pros:- quick and easy set up and use- excellent image quality, especially in low/no light situations- portability of the monitor display (small, light-weight, doesn't have to be plugged in all the time)- zoom feature allows you to zoom in (x2) and then adjust screen area accordingly- can connect to your Skype account to view from any computer (have not attempted this yet, however)- able to add up to 4 cameras- can connect display unit to computer or TV for enlarged viewing- includes date/time stamp on the display- lots of additional featured not found on other monitors in this price rangeCons:- the temperature monitor seemed like a cool feature, however, we've found to be very inaccurate.  It usually reads about 10 degrees warmer than actual temp in the crib.  That's it for the cons!Overall, extremely satisfied with this purchase. I wish we'd bought it from the start, rather than messing with the audio monitor we had first.", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "I really wanted to love this baby monitor!", "Author": "Babyboojk", "ReviewID": "RPL5GPLQV6MO0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First of all, I've tried 3 different baby monitors with the screen. What I expected/wanted from the baby monitors are these:1) Good quality of the screen so I can see my baby (even breathing: chest going up and down at night)2) Easy of use (I just hate anything that is a pain to use)3) Camera pan/zoom option (My baby moves around and I like having camera close to him, so this is a really good feature to have)So, let me explain how those three monitors performed.First one is Motorola Digital Video Baby Monitor with 3.5 Inch Color LCD Screen (At Amazon regular price: 229.99)This one is the winner. It has a good picture quality, zoom in, is really easy to use. That's it. It satisfied all those three categories. Other feature I also liked but not necessary are,, talk back, lullaby (well, kinda useless for my baby). I wish it was made with a little better quality plastic (compared to other two I've tried) and wish it had clock on the screen, which is very helpful at night when the baby wakes up! One thing I noticed though, was that battery of parent unit goes out SO QUICK when it is not plugged in, and use rechargeable battery.Second one is Samsung Wireless Video Security Monitoring System w/ 3.5\" LCD (At Amazon regular price: 179)This one,, sigh... I really wanted to love it... I always trust Samsung quality. and YES, it comes up to that quality standard (both physical material that is made out of, and some great added features) that I look for. BUT there are a few cons that I just could not live with.First of all, this one is LOADED with FEATURES. It has the best quality screen (almost like a digital camera! which is very impressive for a baby monitor! Both day and night time, it showed consistent great quality), talk back, Date/Time, viewable from the computer, etc etc... Just a lot!However what threw me off was that vibration/beep when the parents unit wakes up from the sleep mode. Basically this thing goes to sleep when the baby does not make a sound or makes a sound that's not too alarming. It is trying to give parents some time to sleep unless baby cries so much. HOWEVER, I noticed that it did not pick up small cries that I also wanted to hear. And that VIOLENT vibration would just startle me every time the unit wakes itself from the sleep mode. I almost had heart attack every time it did it. I mean it is VIOLENT vibration. It is way too powerful and hear this, you can not control it, nor you can turn it off. You can either choose between vibration or loud beep, which is also annoying. I guess they did not test this out themselves. If they had a baby, they would know that just sound of a baby crying will wake parents up.Another thing that made me return this unit: lack of zoom and pan feature. OK. I should have read before purchasing this one, but so sad it did not have this feature, while having all other useless ones?! weird.The Last thing I wanna point out on this: freaking annoying to go around the menu and hard to use! This thing is loaded with features (a lot of not so necessary) and but failed to organize it successfully under the menu. Also, it has way too many buttons around the parents unit that I do not think are the \"most-used\" buttons for parents. Once again, did they really test this thing with real parents with real babies?!! It's like having a cell phone, trying to figure out where/what category the feature I want to use might be hidden under. A lot of them were where it did not make sense to me. Basically, very annoying to use.Third one is Summer Infant Best View Handheld Color Video Monitor (At Amazon regular price: 199.99)I had a high hope for this one, as I heard good things about Summer Infant baby monitors. I will make it short. It has the best \"Ease of use\" amongst all three. The parents unit had buttons (shapes and placements) that made most sense out of three I've tried. Plastic (or any other material that were used) quality was great. It does not have bells and whistles as other ones, such as talk back, lullaby, etc etc. It also has zoom in/panning feature that is very helpful.BUT, this is why I returned this thing: the BAD, BAD, I mean BAAAAAAAAAAAD screen quality, especially at night. It made my baby look like those \"ghost pictures\" people take. Like those grainy pictures that people claim that they have captured the ghost in the picture... Get what I mean? It is super grainy I could not recognize my own baby's face! My baby's face filled up the whole screen (I'm saying this to say that I did not have the camera far from my baby) but still I had to guess, oh those two black blobs would be his eyes.. and another one below them is his nose?? no,, mouth??? Yes, basically, if you are looking for a baby monitor with a screen, why would you waste money on a screen that is useless? Move onto other monitors.Finally, after using three, I realized that Motorolla had to be the winner, and I've been using it over a month and very pleased with it.

This is the first one that we feel safe using since it pairs with your camera ONLY, so you dont have to be looking at someone else's baby when the camera is turned off.The only real issue I ran into, is my wireless was affected. This unit uses 2.4ghz frequencies and that cut my wireless bandwidth by 75% on avg. Luckily I can switch the router to 5ghz and that took care of this problem.The range of this unit is perfect for my house layout and the battery is decent too, but I have not really tested the time till full discharge.As far as the alert issues that people are complaining about, there is none. Sorry for all caps, but please read below.THE UNIT HAS AN ALERT FUNCTION, EITHER VIBRATE OR SOUND. YOU NEED TO LEAVE IT ON SOUND IN THE MENU AND THEN TURN THIS DOWN WITH THE ALERT VOLUME BUTTONS ON TOP OF THE RECEIVING UNIT. YOU CAN ACTUALLY MAKE IT COMPLETELY SILENT THIS WAY.

Tucker", "ReviewID": "R1JFJB17ACL5H0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As a basic video baby monitor, this camera works about as well as most, albeit at a premium price (especially if you want additional cameras).However, many of the extra cool features advertised don't actually work as advertised - such as the Skype feature, the temperature sensor, auto-mute and the rechargeable battery pack.  It's like Samsung's product engineering department fell asleep halfway through completion and Samsung's marketing department took the half finished product and ran with it like it was completed.And speaking of non-working features, let's sure hope you don't have any problems with your camera, because their tech support is the worst I've ever encountered (and I work in the IT support industry).  I don't mean they have long hold times, I mean when you call them, you will almost assuredly get their voicemail, and when you leave a voicemail, they will most likely never call you back... as in ever.  Same thing if you email them.Go ahead, try and call them right now and see if you get a hold of anyone:1-877-349-3149Over the last 4-5 months I've made 10+ phone calls and sent 10+ emails and I've heard back all of twice, and only after I escalated by contacting Samsung corporate to let them know their tech support appeared to be on permanent vacation.  Even then, the two replies I got back were extremely short and quick to blame Skype and Microsoft for 'being incompatible with their camera'.If you're curious about the issue, this monitor badly crops and distorts the video resolution of the camera when it's used with Skype on Windows 7.  I've verified it with three separate Windows 7 machines.  It works fine on Windows XP, though.  For some reason their support group believes it's not their job to be compatible with Skype and Windows 7, but instead it's Skype's and Microsoft's responsibility to be compatible with their camera.  But that leaves me begging the question: why are you advertising this camera works on Skype if it doesn't work on the world's most popular desktop operating system?Regarding the other issues (which I haven't even bothered to try to get resolved through tech support):- The thermometer feature in both of my cameras reads way high (85 degrees in a 72 degree room), which makes it pointless.- The auto-mute sensitivity adjustment to wake you up if your baby is crying is impossible to calibrate.  It's either going off all the time or not at all, meaning I can't use auto-mute at all.- The manual claims that you can put rechargeable batteries in the cameras, but the batteries don't actually recharge inside this camera when you plug it in, and even though the manual makes reference to an optional battery pack that's sold separately, it doesn't give a model number, and after extensive searching on the Samsung website and even contacting their sales department, I've finally realized that it doesn't exist.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Disappointed...", "Author": "slattmoan", "ReviewID": "R3QHNY9A1M3YGP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The picture quality was pretty good condiering the price, but the monitoring device vibrated/beeped every 30 seconds with an alarm of some sort.

Everything works great, but they do not tell you about this trigger alert on the camera and it makes the entire product horrible. The trigger alert feature on the camera can be set on a Beep or a Vibrate but it can't be turned off. The only way not to hear the alert is to turn down the sensitivity on the camera when you do that then your baby will start crying and the camera won't turn on until the baby has cryed for awhile if you turn up the sensativity then you and your husband will be awakend all night because even if the baby makes the slightest movement, like sucking his thumb or rolling over to a new position the camera will start to vibrate or beep, and not to mention it doesn't just vibrate a little bit it is just as loud as the beep. Also the lullaby feature is great but there again is were the trigger alert feature is horrible if you play the song to your child the camera will vibrate or beep for the whole entire time. So if you are looking for a camera because you want to get some sleep so your not up all night worrying about your baby this is not the camera for you because if you have the sensativity up so you can hear your little one sleeping then you can't sleep because the of the Beep and the Vibrating, and if you turn the sensativity down then your up all night worrying if you will hear your baby at all!

This Samsung blows them away, and is nearly half the price.

Only noise you hear is if baby wakes up.  Temp gauge is off, but I don't use it and don't care.  Intercom feature is nice, but I hardly use it.

Picture quality during daytime viewing was fine (not great), but the night vision was dismal (the screen was mostly black and we couldn't really see anything at all). We did not test the camera at close range -- this was only mounted in the corner, near the ceiling, about 10 ft. away from toddler in his bed. Also, even with the camera sensitivity set to the highest possible, we could not get the monitor to engage when \"asleep\" when there was noise in the toddler's room (as it was supposed to do). The stand on the monitor was poorly designed, and we found the controls to be somewhat cumbersome.Because night vision was one of our #1 priorities and the Samsung failed there, we returned the Samsung in favor of the Summer Infant BabyTouch, though it was considerably more expensive. We now love the Summer. Not only does it support up to 4 different cameras (like the Samsung), but the cameras MOVE (have the ability to pan around the room). Night vision is amazing, even mounted in the same spot as we had the Samsung (about 10 feet away from our target). Daytime picture is also pretty good. If you're expecting to get TV quality out of a baby monitor, you're not going to find it, and this unit does not have it (neither does the Samsung). But you can certainly see what you need to see. The controls are easy and intuitive, and the touch screen is great. We love that you can turn the video portion off to conserve battery, but still have continuous audio (unlike the Samsung). Video turns on and off with a single button touch. The camera silently pans around the room as well using controls on the touch screen, which the Samsung does not do.If night vision at varying distances is important to you, then the Summer BabyTouch is going to suit your needs better than this Samsung unit.

We were happy with that model other than the fact it interfered with our wireless.We purchased the Samsung Wireless Video Security Monitoring System to replace the Summer model since they have discontinued the model that we had.

We do (did) not have this issue with a Graco monitor we still have and the Summer monitor that was lost-The built in lullabies again are very tinny and annoying so probably won't use-The skype connection was a failure (at least for me) all I got was a black screen when connecting the unit to the computer and skype-Camera does not pan.

In this regard, if the monitor is not fully charge a very annoying alarm will start every few minutes. Therefore, I cannot sleep.2. Every time you turn it off or it gets discharge, the time and date will reset. So, I have to set the time and date EVERY day.3. The AUTO MUTE feature DOES NOT WORK. Supposedly, it cuts off the all environmental noises except for the baby's noises and cry. This is not true, if you turn on this feature you won't be able to hear your baby even if he/she cries very loud. In conclusion, the AUTO MUTE blocks every noise even the baby's cry.4. The beeping sound on the monitor, when you use any button cannot be turned off, so in the middle of the night if you need to change something it beeps.5. Short battery life.6.  The Temperature feature, does not work as well. It always gives you a few degrees above the actual room temperature.7. The vibrate or beep alert function is probably the worst and most annoying feature of this monitor. It is to sensitive, if you have any noise, even a very light one in the baby's room, the beep or vibrator (which is very loud) will go off CONSTANTLY!

No interference most times, although not completely interference free. If you happen to be right next to a lot of electronic equipment (wi-fi router, tv, phones & others) you will have some interference.2) Two-way talk. It works but the baby can hear ONLY IF the volume on the camera is set at maximum or close to max. If volume on the camera is even a little lower than the max. level, the voice won't be loud enough (read: not audible at all) in the baby's room.3) Remote music activation - works, however the music and the lullabies are useless. The speaker quality on the camera/receiver in baby room is horrendous. VERY VERY BAD. It's like the first computer speakers from 20 yrs. ago, they buzz and the sound is metallic with white noise in the background. That is not baby-calming music, just the opposite. Also, be aware that the 4 lullabies are very short (about 1 minute each). The unit plays one and automatically jumps to the next, always in same order. You cannot program it to play one song only.8) Finally, the sleep mode. You can set the receiver to turn the video off after 1,2,5,15 minutes or never. The screen turns off automatically but the alarm that makes it turn back on  doesn't work properly, which makes this an UNRELIABLE monitor.Here's the biggest problems:The camera/transmitter has 2 buttons: volume and sensitivity. The volume controls the music and the incoming voice feature. Unless the volume is set at max., no music or voice comes out of the unit. The speakers on the camera are horrible making the quality of music and voice very bad. The sensitivity button controls how sensitive the receiver is, obviously. On the highest level of sensitivity, the parent unit triggers the alarm non-stop, even if there's absolutely no sound in the room. You need to lower the sensitivity significantly (more than half down) for the parent unit not to trigger the alarm every other second with no reason. However, when you decrease the sensitivity, the parent unit doesn't work reliably. Sometimes the alarm is triggered by low intensity sounds (ie, baby cooing), but about 2 in 3 times you need a really loud sound to trigger the alarm. Because the sensitivity level doesn't work properly, many times you'll end up with a screaming baby before the monitor actually triggers the alarm.

We keep the camera plugged into an outlet 24/7, so we don't know how long it lasts under battery power. We use the monitor both plugged into an outlet and battery powered about an equal amount of time.  The monitor is able to last a reasonable amount of time away from the power cord and it gives you plenty of warning when it is getting low on power. The signal seems to be able to travel a reasonable distance, our house is on the long-ish side and we are able to pick up signal *almost* all the way on the opposite side of the house. The picture both at night (with the infrared) and day seems to be reasonably good, but the point of a camera/monitor in this price range isn't so you count every single hair on your baby's head while they sleep. It is interesting that the displayed picture can be a combination of visible light and infrared light - it will use the picture from the visible light (in color) when its intensity/brightness is greater than that of the picture from the infrared light (displays on a grey scale). We like that we can have the sound only kick on when he is making sounds over the background noise (we also have a white noise machine). Other features we use include talking and turning on a night light (built into the top of the camera). We haven't used the music feature at all. I also have not tried to hook it up to our computer(s) to view the camera online. Our son still sleeps in our room, so we only use it for his naps and for a few hours when he goes down in the evening before we go to sleep.Things we don't like include the temperature reading (which is usually about +10 degrees from the actual temperature in the room), the talk button right next to the power on/off slide, and, most recently, the date/time read out. Apparently there is a leap-year bug in our device. When the date set is associated with any leap-year, the device will reset to June 10, 2010 12:00AM when we turn the device back on (it will not do this with any other year). While we would like to have these features work/arranged better, not having them perfect is more of an annoyance than anything else.UPDATE (01/04/2012) - Samsung is aware of the leap-year bug and is working on a fix. [Knocked it down to 3 out of 5 stars.]UPDATE (05/30/2012) - The signal from the camera does not display on the device anymore, only works when video is output to TV (or some other external display). The only work around (as crazy as it may seem) is to take the power cord (unplug from the wall) and plug the end that would normally go into the power-in slot into the video-out slot... somehow that provides the necessary connection/resistance to signal the onboard display to come on. Otherwise... no dice! The device also has issues charging (connections are not so good). Since we mostly have the monitor output signal to the TV, we wedge a non-electricity conducting object between where the power cord and where the video/audio output cord is plugged into the device. That seems to help the connection... for now. Too many workarounds to recommend this device to a friend. [Knocked it down to 2 out of 5 stars].UPDATE (05/06/2012) - Just in case anyone else has the same display issues I have... I ended up going to Radio Shack and purchasing the power adapter tip thingie that is the same size as the one at the end of the power adapter cord that comes with the monitor, so we do not need to lug around the entire power adapter cord to get the display to show up on the screen when we are away from an external display.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic monitor", "Author": "Lola", "ReviewID": "R3R1C3ELAHVL7Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have been extremely happy with this purchase.

Since you have to turn down sensitivity all the way to rid yourself of the annoying beeping (or vibrating), automute stays on short of a tornado warning in the room.Skype : If you have a computer on, monitor connected to computer, computer logged into skype and set to auto answer,  external camera selected as the video unit within skype ... then you can call said computer and SEE your baby. no voice supported either way. kinda gimmickyScreen - Large screen is great in the house, brightness is lacking outside on a cloudy day. To adjust the brightness you must enter the menu. Not a big deal in my book, just one extra step.Range - Works great in my house and yard. Cuts out in the exact same spot as the mobi did. I assume they all get the same range being on the same frequency, etc.In summary, it is almost a great unit. I would definitely recommend it on build quality over other $150 monitors. With that said we will be returning and buying the motorola.

The downside is that the sound alarm (trigger) function is fatally flawed.The unit has a sound level alarm which makes the remote unit beep (or vibrate).  At least I think it is a sound level alarm.  The alarm does not always go off when there is noise... it just seems to go off randomly all the time. With sensitivity up the remote will beep constantly.  If you set the sensitivity dial on the camera to it's minimum sensitivity setting the remote's sound alarm will still inexplicably beep every few minutes (there was no sound in the room).  You can turn the remote's alarm sound down but not off or set it to vibrate only which is actually louder than the soft beep.The remote also has a auto mute function which mutes the background noise that tied to the same sensitivity setting.  With the sensitivity turned down you will not hear anything short of all out crying.  With the sensitivity turned up you will hear normally but the remote's alarm will go off several times a minute.To get it to work acceptably, I had to turn down the remote's alarm volume and the camera sound sensitivity down as far as they could go and turned the remote's auto mute off.  This results in a monitor that relays all the sound, including the background white noise to the unit.  With these settings the alarm softly beeps a couple times every few minutes.Another negative is that while there is a volume control for the alarm, there is no way to control the volume of the relayed sounds of your baby.I do not recommend this unit for the purpose of monitoring a baby due to the flawed alarm function.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "2nd time monitor mom", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "R325HCV2DC8QF0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First we purchases the Mobi7602. Great monitor but it died and we did not have time to send it back to the manufacturer to get it repair before going on vacation and needing a monitor. So here are my observations of the pro and cons.PRO's-Great video, comparing side by side the Mobi and Samsung I was surprised to see how poor the Mobi video appeared.-Clear night vision-No internet interference. Our Mobi monitor didn't just interfere it totally shutdown out wireless internet.-Large screen our Mobi monitor had a 1.5in screen and no matter how we mounted the monitor we could not get the whole monitor in the screen.  With the Samsung we do not have this issue because of the size of the screen and the mounting.-Great range of motion with the camera, because the camera swivels 360 it was easy to adjust to view the entire area I wanted viewed. The Mobi monitor we had only adjusted up and down making this feature with the Samsung such a joy.-Remote turning on the nightlight and music. Easy way to keep kiddo happy with him seeing us come in to turn either on.-Easy mountCON's-When the monitor is close to being out of charge the range is under 350ft. Places that the monitor normally reads start showing out of range the closer it gets to low charge.-No battery level indicator. We never know how close we are to an empty battery until the monitor dies.-Temp level is inaccurate it picks up on the heat coming from the camera. No big deal for us.-Wish it had remote on for the camera as well-Buttons need a little extra push to get a reaction-Feels a little flimsy compared to our Mobi monitor.When we purchased this monitor we saw a handful complaints that I understand but are easily fixed.FIRSTMonitor does have an alarm for when the baby makes noise, out of the box it is set on vibrate. Yes it is super annoying but easily fixed. The alarm can be changed to a beep and then the volume on the beeping can be turned down to mute. That eliminates that issue.SECONDThere does seem to be lots of white noise. There is an \"auto mute\" button what this does is mutes out the white noise and then amps the volume when the baby makes enough noise to trigger it on. For my son he is a restless sleeper, he rolls around all night, the auto mute picks up on that, which for me is ideal. I want to know when he wakes up and being sneaky and quiet, thinking out climbing out of his crib.Overall I would say that this monitor is great, it is very portable, easy to set up and great for what we use it for.

We've only had this unit for 6+ months and after 1 fall on a CARPETED FLOOR it stopped working. I am stuck buying a new system (parent unit + camera), since the parent unit can't be ordered separately. All in all, this was not a good purchase: no support for multiple cameras in web cam mode, no calibration for the thermostat and no durability. Stay away.***We put this monitor through the paces this weekend.  Since we are having twins, we bought an additional camera.  Using the main screen, the images are bright and after some adjustment everything seems to work fine.  I have STRONG words of caution if you are buying this because of the \"Skype\" features or are planning to plug it into your Windows computer.*You need a CD drive to install the drivers.  There was no place to download the drivers.  You cannot find the product under the main Samsung.com website, you have to go to Samsungsv.com.  Something not smell right? Yeah...  But SamsungSV.com is no help either - no driver download, nothing.*There is no software that comes with this camera.  They don't mention any software and in fact there is nothing, only a driver that allows the camera to be used like a web-cam.  So officially you can't complain about this... but I do find it very odd.  I was expecting at least a lame viewing interface for your computer.*The image when viewing through the main monitor LCD screen is way larger than what appears when you view it as a web-cam.  So if you are aiming that camera at your baby and it looks great on the screen you are carrying around, odds are that most of your baby will be off screen if you try viewing it as a webcam.  This is aweful - in 2011 isn't digital information being carried through a USB cable still digital information?  Shouldn't the image information like image size and format stay the same??  But no.*When viewing as a web-cam, you can only see one camera.  This is very annoying. When using the main viewer, the cameras can be set to auto-rotate.  Works great.  When in USB web-cam mode, this is disabled for some unkown reason.  You CAN change cameras, manually, if you sit and hit the button on the viewer that is hooked into your computer, but that makes no sense if you are trying to use this device over Skype.  And the reason has to be just poorly written software.  Why sell a unit that can support 4 cameras but then not support all 4 cameras for internet viewing?  Sad, for an otherwise great looking product, especially if you have multiple kids/cameras.*Skype - well it \"works with\" Skype - sorta.  I was able to create a Skype account for the monitor that is hooked up to a dedicated computer.  It can be set to automatically connect to video calls, BUT for whatever reason the camera does not automatically come on, I just get an icon without video.  If I'm with the Samsung unit and the computer, during the call I can hit the \"video\" button and vwalla! it works.  But again, that doesn't work if you are trying to use it over Skype.  So I am very dispointed with the internet functionality of this unit.  I think the description is misleading in selling the Skype functionality.

This is awful!  There is already audio, so if the baby makes noise you can hear it.  It is not necessary to be subjected to a BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ every time there is a slight noise in the nursery.  As most parents know, part of creating good sleep habits is letting your baby learn to self soothe.  That means you can't go running into the nursery with every peep from the baby.  With this monitor, my baby is self soothing and falling back to sleep while I've got a buzzer going off in my bedroom all night long.  The point of a baby monitor is to help the parent get sleep knowing the baby is fine.  If I wanted buzzing every 2 hours, I would just set my alarm clock.  Not to mention that while it is buzzing, the actual baby audio cuts out.  So in order to determine what is going on with your baby, you must wait through the 4 buzzes.  Also, the temp sensor is not accurate, so if that is a deal breaker, look elsewhere.  I think the feature, had it worked, would be very nice.  But it has been way off since we got it.

For those of you who have the constant annoying beeping alert problem I recommend checking your cord. After 3 sleepless nights of continous beeping found a tear on the cord close to the actual adaptor. Basically the unit was not always being charged so the unit would then turn off and on all night.

I used it the money form Amex to buy the new (2013) model thinking it would work with the old camera, so I'd have two. It doesn't, AND the 2013 model has less features (no temp, for example, not that the old one ever told the right temp).

The picture quality/night vision works great, it has wonderful reception, and the built-in music feature helps calm my daughter down. Now for some negatives:1. As other reviewers mentioned, the temperature reading is wrong. Very wrong. I don't care because I don't use that function. It might be important to some people.2. Over time the battery life has dwindled to a pretty sucky level. It now only lasts a few hours, and often doesn't make it through my daughter's long nap before needing a charge. I feel more comfortable leaving the picture on the screen instead of letting the unit hibernate when there is no sound/movement. It would probably last longer if I did.3. My daughter moves around a lot in her sleep, so it would be nice to have a camera that can pan/tilt. She also responds very well to white noise, which this unit doesn't have.4. The time stamp on the picture resets itself often, even if the battery hasn't died during use. Not sure what the reason is for this, but it's just a minor annoyance. I am not using the device as a clock, so it doesn't bother me.For the price, however, this monitor is a steal!

Unfortunately we don't love ours and the one purchased for the grandparents stopped working on the second use. Below are all the problems we've experienced:- Temperature gauge does not actually work - It consistently says it's 80+ degrees in our son's room which is not true.- Each time you turn the monitor off and back on, it loses the date/time settings.- There is a really annoying sensitivity setting that either beeps or vibrates constantly. You can't actually use this setting because it would be going off all night long for no reason.- There is no way to turn the picture off but keep the sound on in order to preserve battery life. We'd like to be able to hear our son while we're sleeping at night but obviously don't need the picture because our eyes are closed. But there is no way to shut the picture off while keeping the sound on. This means the battery dies quickly so we have to keep the monitor plugged in all night long. And the picture is so bright in a dark bedroom that we have to cover it or place it face down so it doesn't light up our entire room.The picture is great and you can literally hear every breath our son takes so the audio is great too. However, there are too many downsides to this monitor for me to recommend it for the insanely high price.The one we bought for my parents (our son's grandparents) stopped working on the second use.

It's the best looking by far of all the monitors, and feels expensive.  The picture is decent (much better than our neighbor's Summer Infant) and the screen is bigger.  However, calling this a color monitor is a stretch - nightvision is obviously not color, but even in broad daylight the colors are washed out.  Overall the camera works great, and since the whole thing can run off wall power or batteries, we are pretty pleased.  Here are my major gripes; it would be a perfect product of these were fixed:1. Beeping - Every time you press a button on the monitor (and you have to click several to do anything), it beeps.  There is no mute.  So when my wife tries to zoom or adjust something, you get a loud beep every time.  Considering baby monitors are used at night, this was not a wise choice.2. All or Nothing - As far as I can tell, there is no option to hear only sound and turn off the video - and the lowest level of brightness will light up a dark room.  Audio mode would have been a great feature at times.3. Temp Alarms - As others have mentioned, the temp sensor is always way off, saying it's 90 in a room that is 75.  But you can just ignore that, right? Well - there is an alarm that goes off when the temp gets high.  Yes, you CAN select to disable this, but in our extensive experience, it's hit or miss to actually turn it off.  It either vibrates or beeps EVERY 5 SECONDS until you turn it off, on, disable, enable, etc.  Wish this would have been a hard switch as the menu setting doesn't always take.4. Monitor Stand - we keep the monitor on a nightstand, as you'd expect. The little built-in kickstand is wimpy, only comes out about an inch, and doesn't lock.  Most of the time, reaching for the monitor means knocking it over.5. Skype integration a little misleading - So we were excited that this camera could possibly display video of our sleeping baby over Skype, wow, how high-tech!  Well, when they say \"Works with Skype\", they mean you can output the monitor (wired) to a running computer that has Skype and use the camera as a remote webcam.

The \"singing\" function is useless as it plays very soft and, as mentioned, the speaker is mediocre.

When the monitor is plugged in there are never any lapses in the screen. When it is unplugged and I take it into my mancave (third floor down) it can lose picture and go black because its \"out of range\".

There is also a USB cable that is supposed to make it so you can use Skype, or various other instant message programs to view your baby on your computer. The computer feature was attractive to my husband and me, mainly because my husband works from home and to be able to click a window and bring up a picture-in-picture image of the baby seemed an obvious (and very cool) choice - but it doesn't work - at least that we know of. We both installed the software on each of our computers - his is a Mac, mine is a PC - and we've tried several times to get it working to no avail. We did conclude, though, that since the actual monitor has to be plugged into the computer for this feature to work, it's not the end of the world. The image and sound may not pop up on the computer like this monitor boasts, but it's not like you can't just pick up the monitor, which can't be more than a couple feet away, and see and hear your baby just the same.

I have it installed to the left above the baby's crib, which is not a large distance away. Saw another reviewer complaining of the night vision when installed at a distance, but mine is good.  I haven't tried a long-distance installation as I don't need that.*The audio is excellent with absolutely no white noise!  I can hear the baby breathing and it is just like I am sleeping in the bed next to his crib.*The walkie-talkie feature is very clear.*Night light is a nice feature and you can control it from the parent's unit.  So, if he is crying I can turn it on for a little light.*The range is good with the little antena up, considering our old house has solid wood walls.  It works even from the farthest room in the house.*Parent's unit plugs in and stays charged a long time.  I can get 6-7 hours on a single charge.  No batteries to buy!*Time based alarm on the parents unit allows me to set it to wake up to pump w/out having to set and re-set my regular alarm.*Very small and sleek, smart-phone like appearance of the parent's unit.  Lightweight and very portable.Bad:*The temperature is about 10 degrees off i.e. if the temp is 72, the unit reads 82.  I saw another reviewer complaining of the same thing, so I don't think the issue is isolated.*The sensitivity of the sleep mode audio alarm is very hard to get adjusted.  The intent is to adjust the level to where it doesn't go off for normal rustling, but will go off when baby is crying (when you use the sleep mode, the audio and video goes completely off and only comes back on when the alarm is triggered based on the audio sensitivity you have set).  I had it set where the alarm was constantly going off.  And then barely move it down at all and the alarm doesn't go off when he cries.  It's been a pain to get it at an acceptable level.  So, instead, I've set it to the least sensitive, which is like turning it off. There is no offical off switch.*The volume is tricky as it only works in 1x view and not 2x view.  See the discussion related to this post for instructions from a helpful poster.*No audio only option so that I am not bothered by the screen light glow in my room at night (I prefer not to use the sleep mode and keep the sensitivity at the lowest level).  However, I get around this by just setting it face down on a microfiber cloth.  Speaker is on the back of the unit, so this works just fine.*As another reviewer stated, the beeping when menu items/buttons are selected is annoying for your partner in bed still trying to sleep while you are playing with the monitor.*Support is horrible.  I called to have a question answered and every time got answering machine.  No response after 1 week and counting!!  This is unacceptable and will make me reconsider future samsung purchases.Overall, it's a great monitor and cheaper than other monitors with the talk feature.

After reading the manual I figured out that the trigger alert was completely superflous since the screen and audio turn on automatically once the sensitivity is set properly.b) It does take trial and error to setup the sensitivity properly, but the camera does a good job ignoring atmospheric sounds. Once we had the sensitivity dialed in, the basic functionality was absolutely clear and static free in a cluttered frequency building where all other monitors suffered from static, popping, and interference.c) The lullaby music playback is unusable since the quality of sound from the small tinny speaker is awful.  Push to talk works OK, though.d) The temperature monitor is also completely unusable and is consistently ~20 degrees higher than actual.e) the charger door on the receiving unit is flimsy and just gets in the way.  Mine fell off after a few days but I discovered it was better not having it in the way when I needed to plug it in so I ripped the small charger flap off and threw it in the trash.  I also think the Summer Infant stand design is better.f) It's true that if plugged in without power it doesn't operate.  Be careful that if plugged in for charging that there is electricity coming from the outlet or else it will be off without you knowing it.Now, all that said, how can I give this FIVE stars?! Simply put, the basic functionality as a video monitor is the best out there after trying every major brand.  The bells and whistles don't work well, but we never use those features anyway.  What we need and got was a rock-solid, dependable baby monitor with excellent sound/video reception, no static/interference, and surprising range even through multiple walls.  The additional camera support is a major plus as I was able to position multiple cameras on different channels over several common locations with no issues whatsoever.  Finally, the search is over!***UPDATE***: After 10 months of use, I ran into a few problems.- The date/time wouldn't stay set after turning it off once 2012 hit. There is a firmware update available to fix this problem (which BTW slightly refreshes the look of the UI). Call 1-877-349-3149 to have a technical representative assist you. If you'd like to try updating the firmware yourself, you need to know that you'll have to hold down the select (center button) key when plugging in the micro-USB cable. The firmware download has no instructions, either. Basically, you need to download the firmware from samsungsv.com, plug in the mini-USB holding down the select key, then update the generic driver, then run the ISP application to update the firmware.- The AC power adapter went belly up.

All I can say is if you like vibrating plastic on your end table and lack of reception beyond a 20' radius, this is the monitor for you.1st, if the volume is at 0 and the alarm is put into the \"off\" position on this, it constantly starts vibrating at the slightest noise made by the baby. Baby burps, 4 rousing vibrations to wake you from a dead sleep. This is when it is in the off position. Off should mean off. But in this case off means there will not be a shrieking alarm from the hand set. Just vibrations that make you think you are trying to sleep though a moderate earthquake or low earth atmospheric meteor strike. Eventually you get used to it. My dreams now always have a black hawk helicopter hovering over me releasing sound in 4 ominous vibrations.2nd, the range is fantastically horrible. My 3 year old can throw a 1986  Pontiac Fiero further than the range on this bad larry. Sometimes when I turn it on in my hallway, where I am one foot away from the monitor, it reads no signal. I am literally within one foot of the base camera and I have no range. I do not have lead paint in my house. I stripped the walls and fed the paint chips to my first two daughters and the dog. The dog is no longer with us. I had to shoot him because he barked every time this thing vibrated. But maybe the paint chips made him edgy. And yes, the monitor did vibrate after I shot him, but then it lost signal.3rd, Temperature gauge is off, by about 10 degrees. I have central heat. It is 70 degrees in my house. It is not 89 degrees in my daughter's bedroom. The monitor must be picking up temperature readings from where it was cast in the dark calloused hands of the fallen angel Satan. I am sure he takes great pride in this Korean relic of parental anxiety. Between this and my mother's mental issues, all I can say is \"Thanks a lot Obama\". I tried throwing it away. Later that evening I heard 4 vibrations outside my window. It was Obama riding on the back of 7 headed dragon Satan. He said he had something of mine. He threw the monitor at me. I asked him how he knew it was mine. He said because it had no signal, but if it did it would be 89 degrees in my daughter's room. Well played POTUS, well played.4th, Demon baby night vision eyes. I don't know if its just me, but I don't like correlating my child's night vision supervision with the same raccoon eyes seen in \"A night in Paris\". It's just weird. It's your kid, not a deer, so put down the deer camera. I was a little bit freaked by the night vision on our first baby monitor, but the definition on this one is eerie. That is when I can get a signal, which is even more of an eerie event. I am constantly looking for other glowing eyes in the room, like Obama's or Satan's.Samsung makes a great television. They should leave baby monitoring to others who don't have the dark lord creating their product and Obama sponsoring it.

The one feature that had me going was a rotary switch on the camera which sets the sensitivity for an alarm in the monitor whenever the sound threshold in the baby's room is exceeded.  It was set for maximum sensitivity and the alarm was reporting continuously.  Took me a while to find out what the cause was.  A couple downsides to the system.. if the noise threshold sensitivity level is set high (so you can hear a pin drop in the baby's room, the the alarm will go off when you remotely switch on the music.  Also, the camera has a room temperature monitor, but it is mounted so close to the camera, that it reflects more the camera temp than the room's.  So it reads about 10 degrees warmer on the monitor and is virtually useless.  (not a deal breaker though). Overall it seems like a great system..", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY THIS MONITOR!!!", "Author": "Ally", "ReviewID": "R3OWJB6845E2NN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this monitor on Amazon because it got decent positive reviews.

The picture is great. One thing I really dislike about it is how you have to set the sensitivity on the camera just perfect for it you to have the ability to put it in sleep mode. If the sensitivity is too low the monitor will not come out of sleep  mode when baby crys. If you have sensitivity set too high the monitor will continuously beep/vibrate. It is really irritating. I have yet to find the perfect sensitivity setting. Therefore I sleep with the screen on and it puts off a very bright glow in my bedroom. Other then that major flaw. I love it. best of luck to others", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "UNFORTUNATELY, A HORRIBLE PURCHASE", "Author": "kymkash", "ReviewID": "R227MQ71MP44VA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this video camera anticipating a great product because it had the \"samsung\" label attached to it. I will say that I ordered from a 3rd party seller \"ziotech\" so it wasn't necessarily amazon's fault. for one, i ordered one day shipping, and it didn't get sent to me on time, amazon happily refunded my shipping costs. I ordered this product with an additional camera. this could be due to the seller, but when i received it, it looked used. there were what seemed like to me, fingerprints on the monitor screen already. SO, with that being said, it could be a bad unit that was sent to me by ziotechs fault but regardless i am going to write my review. for one, the image quality was NOT clear, it looked like night vision and was extremely grainy. i made sure it wasn't on night vision and it still didn't have the \"crisp\" picture its reviews boasted about. secondly, when i tried the two way talk feature, there was a delay and it came through choppy. there indeed was no \"pan\" option, but I knew that when i purchased it. I live in a 1000 sq ft town home, and as soon as I went upstairs, I was \"out of range\" and the only way to get a screen shot was to turn it off and on. but as long as I was upstairs, i could not get a picture. i actually laughed to myself thinking how horrible this product was. secondly, when i tried to pair the additional camera, it would not, and i followed the directions exactly as they stated. i finally resorted to calling customer service, but of course, they were not open on the weekends. ???? i decided to do something i had NEVER done before. i placed everything back in the box and called amazon to return it. amazon apologized, let me know it was from a 3rd party seller, issued me a one time advanced refund which was in my opinion great of them to do, because they didn't have to. I went ahead and purchased the Motorola Digital Video Baby Monitor with the 3.5 inch screen. Just arrived this morning and I am blown away at how clear the screen is, and easy to use and able to function with. I would like to say that maybe it was a problem by the sellers, but I don't know. Just my opinion. Maybe it worked for you, but it definitely did NOT for me.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do not buy", "Author": "Ashley Byrne", "ReviewID": "R3479C4PLRYJGT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We had a previous samsung monitor that we were replacing.
