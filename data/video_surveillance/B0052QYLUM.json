I have to admit I was a bit skeptical about it because it was so low in price compared to other video monitors but I am so glad I took a chance.  It is the perfect monitor if all you are looking for is a monitor to keep eye on your little one while she sleeps or plays.  The IR night vision is perfect, you can see your baby clear as day.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a video monitor whether you are on a budget or not.  It doesnt take a genius to figure out how to work, no bells and whistles, just basics.

I spent the first week sleeping in the same room with him and as we transitioned back to \"normal\" I have been comfortable which I am sure makes him more comfortable.I mounted the camera high at the end of a small room where Bear sleeps.

The plastic is cheap and its very light weight. But, we don't care as long as it works. We can see and hear our little guy very clear no matter day or night. I don't know why we waited so long to get a video monitor. It is well worth the extra $20 to upgrade from just the audio to Video and Audio. Our last audio monitor had major issues with cutting out, shutting off and major wifi interference issues. No such issues with the Infant Optics. We are very pleased and we LOVE the ability to have the monitor battery operated so we can bring it downstairs or outside while he sleeps. The more expensive systems had bigger screens, but had to be plugged in which was a deciding factor FOR this one. The only thing is I wish it had is the ability to shut off the video and just use audio. We have a white noise machine in the nursery and that keeps the video and audio on constantly at night which even at the lowest \"brightness\" setting is still bright at night. So the VOX setting doesn't work for us because of the noise machine.

But being $100, it's not a 5 star product.  Take into consideration that this is the only monitor I've owned.  We've used it for 6 months now.Pros:- Price.  Seriously great price- Video.  The quality looks great.  There is definitely better quality out there but you don't need better than this.- Night vision.  I've been really impressed with how well it switches to night vision and how good it looks.- Auto sound.  This thing detects what is background noise so well.  So the general hum of the room doesn't cause the monitor to make sound.  It will hum for about 5 seconds and then silent until a noise is made.  It is so nice to not have that hum always going.- Signal lost sound.  If it loses it's signal, it's a loud beep.  This is nice because you want to be aware and wake up when it happens.  Rarely ever happened to us though.- Design - Easy and intuitive to use.  Stands up nice on a desk or clipped to your shorts.  Camera was easy to mount and position.Good enough:-Sound quality - it's got some static, but no more than I've heard from friends monitors.  And you get used to it pretty quick.  The volume levels are nice.-Camera width - You have to place the camera pretty high up the wall to get a full view of the crib.  I don't know what is normal but it seems like they could make a wider lens.  It works for us though.Cons:-Battery Life is short.  You basically have to always keep it plugged in.  I think we get maybe an hour.  This was annoying at first but we got used to it quick-Video won't turn off.  I think some models allow this but we can't turn the video off.  It would help battery life and keep our room from glowing all night.-Signal lost sometimes.

The VOX setting where it turns off the sound and picture after 3 minutes of quiet is unnerving at first, but seems to kick back on when it should.But I noticed my Apple TV was buffering really bad when trying to stream Netflix, and my wife's Laptop had dial-up speeds trying to pull up websites, with the monitor camera on.I have a Cisco E2500 Dual band WiFi router.  Using Speedtest.net app on my phone (and standing by the camera), I had 18mb download speeds with the camera off, and when I turned it on, it dropped to .20 to .50mb speeds.  Upload speeds were not affected and stayed around 3MB.After trying different settings on the 2.4Ghz band, I found that setting to Channel Width to 20mhz (default is auto for 20mhz or 40mhz) and setting on Channel 11 instead of Auto, did the trick to ovoid the conflicts.Channel 1,6,and 11 typically do not overlap and might work better then the others.  A 2.4GHz wireless network can have up to 3 routers working in a small area with no overlapping by using channel numbers 1, 6 and 11. If you have a lot of neighbors with WiFi (and who doesn't these days) this might help as well.EDIT:Well, the next night I still continued to have issues with WiFi in the house with the monitor on.  I was able to move my 2 iPads and Apple TV to 5Ghz N network, as the E2500 is a dual band.  However this leaves my Wife's laptop, Kids Laptop, and our iPhone's still with WiFi issues when this is on.Will see what workarounds I can find....EDIT:Well, it still creates havoc on our 2.4Ghz network when in use, but most everything we have can also run on 5Ghz so really a non-issue.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "A must have for parents that plan to sleep train", "Author": "Lindsey Carol \"Linds\"", "ReviewID": "R25Y9VC7ZUUOTX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, I always said that I was not going to need a video monitor.  A sound monitor is perfectly fine...then came the torture but necessary sleep training in our house.  This is HUGE when it comes to piece of mind while feeling unsure about your baby crying.  There is no need for an expensive video monitor, this one works perfect.  I would suggest buying an extra cord (they are not expensive, mabye $6) because if your cord frays like ours did, you won't have to worry about what to do until you can get another one.  A great idea would be to leave a cord in your bedroom as well as another room (living room/kitchen) so you don't have to constantly plug and unplug which is what caused ours to break.There is a con to the device, it definitely interferes with our wireless internet signal.

Essentially, I was using it as a cheap security camera (CC TV).The video quality is average to slightly above average. If you want to see fine detail, this is not the product for you. However, the video quality for the price point is good value. I have not tried out the night vision yet, so I cannot comment on that. The audio quality is about the same, average to above average.There are nice auto-mute and auto-off features where if no sound or motion is detected the units go into stand-by mode. Upon detecting movement or sound, the units re-activate. I found these features very helpful for the purpose for which I use the units.The unit housings are made of light-weight plastic. Some people dislike this, however, I think it make the units easy to mount and move without the use of tools. The camera unit can be mounted using those 3M adhesive strips and the monitor unit is light enough to carry around with you. The monitoring unit also has a built in stand for hands-free convenience. This characteristic is really a matter of preference and I don't mind light-weight plastic housings.In October, the audio cut out while the video continued to function. I called the customer service line to no results. Then I emailed the company and within 48 hours, the representative emailed me back with instructions on how to ship back my defective unit. Once I provided proof of shipping, they shipped me a replacement unit (brand new, not refurbished). I am quite satisfied with the customer service I received via email.Bottom Line: Considering that it is cheaper than most audio and video monitoring systems, you get good value on your purchase price--especially if you can get it on sale. Both video and audio qualities are average or slightly above average. My experience with customer service was good via email, but poor via telephone. In the end, the company replaced the defective product and all I had to do was pay for shipping the old product back to the company.

However, there's one caveat you should be aware of: this baby monitor, like most others, operates on the 2.4 GHz wireless band.  Your router most likely operates on the same band (unless you've upgraded to a dual band model).  This baby monitor WILL interfere with your wireless internet.  It repeatedly jumps channels in order to find the best channel and hold great video.  Therefore, there's no way to set your router to a certain channel and avoid the interference.  However, you can minimize the interference by 1) selecting a channel on either extreme of the band (channel 1 or 11) and 2) keeping your wireless device as far away from the monitor as possible.  Nevertheless, you will encounter interference.We got this monitor from our baby's godfather as a present off our registry.  I almost returned it.  I couldn't stand the interference.  However, this is the best baby monitor I've used.  I tried a WiFi camera (Dropcam) but discovered it's just not reliable/safe to use as a baby monitor.  The sound sporadically came through, which meant that I missed my little girl screaming until I heard her on my own through the bedroom door.  I promptly returned it.For $99 you can't beat this monitor!  The video quality is great (including night mode) and audio is too.  I feel very comfortable using it as a baby monitor for my beautiful little girl.  Tip: Hit the brightness down & volume up buttons at the same time to turn auto-mute on/off.  I love this option!Here's what I've done to deal with the interference: 1) wired as many devices as possible (my computers and Roku), 2) changed the router's operating channel to 11, and 3) tried to use my iPhone as far away as possible from the monitor (while still being able to keep an eye on my daughter).  When interference is particularly bad I just turn off WiFi and use data for a few minutes, or hop on my wired computer.Even with the WiFi interference I highly recommend this baby monitor.  I'm giving it 5 stars because ALL baby monitors that operate on the 2.4 GHz band will have this problem.

The power button is right on the side where you place your thumb or fingers.3) Tends to hold onto ghost images and sounds. I can be flipping through the cameras and it will show something that isnt there or actually play a sound that is not there. It will refresh within a second, but can be alarming at times.4) Battery could last a while longer. Cannot make it through an 8 hour night unplugged.All in all, we like these units and would recommend them. The negatives are annoying but nothing that is a deal breaker for us.

Our older son is not quite ready to be in his room at night without a monitor and our younger son is already sleeping in his own room.What I like:- No frills such as playing music or being able to talk through the monitor.  We've had too many grandparents and babysitters press music and talkback buttons on our older monitor (and wake up a sleeping baby) to want to have to deal with that.- Pairing a second camera was pretty easy.What I don't like:- When using two or more cameras, the audio alert and VOX features only work on the active camera.  So, if you have two children to monitor you would need to manually switch between cameras to see what's going on.- The VOX feature is off by default and, more importantly, there doesn't seem to be a pattern to making it stay on.  Sometimes you can turn the monitor on and it's in VOX mode and sometimes it's not.  There's no way to force it to stay on.  The instructions and Infant Optics customer service give you steps to turn it on, but it doesn't seem to stay on.- The VOX mode lasts for three minutes and the audio alert is 10 seconds.  I'd prefer to see the VOX turn off after a shorter time.I had a nice email conversation with Mae at Infant Optics.  She answered all of my questions and confirmed the information above.

It was on par with an iPhone box.3.  Good Range - we've used it from opposite side of our ranch-style house.  Appears to have a pretty good range.4. Battery life is pretty good on the monitor; over time we will have to see how many charge cycles it can endure.5.  Image is crisp -- looks a little like Paranormal Activity, but the night vision gives you a good look at your little one.Con's1.  Plastic used to build isn't great - a bit thin and brittle - but for the price I wouldn't expect much, so its a mild Con.2.  The camera has limited vertical range (good horizontal), so it makes it difficult when positioning on a shelf above the height of the crib.  I ended up rigging a weird balanced tilt that gave the right view of most of the crib.3.  It picks up very slight audio and this gets echo'd back into the unit and I find it disturbing at night4.  It doesn't have a dimmer!  Very bright display lights up the room . . . takes a week or two to get used to.Overall, I think its a great product for those looking for a little more than audio.

Unfortunately when we had our second we found that while you can ADD more cameras to the parent unit, there's no way to scan between the cameras. It only monitors the camera you're set to. We ended up buying the Motorola mpb36 with two cameras because it can scan back and forth all night, but it doesn't have VOX or the battery life that this unit had. I wish this one would scan between the cameras, and if they were to make an upgraded version it would be nice to pan/zoom, and have a temp readout. The VOX on this is perfect, it would light up whenever my daughter cried but never picked up the music or white noise in her room.

And I am using it to monitor older children (2.4 and 1).  So I didn't place the camera so close to baby.  We're past SIDS risk so I don't need to use this camera to check breathing.  I want to see what my boys are up to when awake.  We have not tried to add another camera.Pros:  This unit is much more affordable than other video monitors.  It was simple to set up and operate.  The picture is pretty good even with the infrared.  I love how portable the monitor is.  We live in a tri-level home (a basement and 3 half levels split up).  The nursery is on the top level and the camera has perfect reception in the basement.Cons:  We had to get creative on placement.  We wanted the camera to watch the whole room, not just the head of a baby in a crib.  This monitor is not designed to be hung in the corner of a room.  We improvised by installing a small corner shelf and setting it up there.  And that means we had to use an extension cord coming down the wall and we can't easily turn the camera on or off.  It just stays plugged in and on all the time.  We also experienced major wifi interference, like many other reviewers.  We had to buy a new wireless router that was dual band to be able to use the iPad in our bedroom (right next to the nursery).  We still have trouble with the smart TV but that might just be the TV's problem.  Battery life on the monitor isn't that great.  And if the battery is running low, the light just blinks (no audio alarm) so if it starts blinking in the middle of the night you might wake up to the monitor having turned off sometime in the night.  I just plug it in when I go to bed and let it charge all night. Problem solved.Overall I like this camera.  It doesn't have a ton of features but gets the job done.  I didn't need anything fancy and didn't want to pay for features that I wasn't going to use.  I would recommend this system to anyone who wants just a basic video monitor.

At a glance from across the room, I can tell whether my daughter is moving around, sitting up, changing positions, etc. I keep it at a low volume, and I can still hear her crying over the volume of my TV, but it's not super distracting.I like the VOX feature that turns off the screen and sound when there is no sound detected for 3 minutes. I wish this was a programmable time (like say turn off after 1 minute), and I wish it could monitor multiple channels for a multi-camera setup. You can add cameras, but it will only kick on if there is sound in the room of whichever camera you have selected at the time. I wish there was a feature where say you have it on camera 1, but the child on camera 2 cries, it would switch to that camera and kick on.

My son's room is upstairs and this monitor works even when I am all the way down in the basement or in the yard! It was also important to me that the line/camera have 100% privacy..I have read that some monitors have picked up other video from neighbors' monitors! - This uses digital 2.4 Ghz wireless transmission that says it is 100% private in addition to using Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum for interference free connection. It also has an option that turns off the monitor when there is no noise (to conserve power) and it re-activates or turns back on when any noise is detected -  I should say I have not tried this. I have that feature turned off so that at night mine stays on so I can't say how well that feature works. The volume on the unit seems perfect to me - not too quiet- not too loud.

I can hear the noise machine a little bit, but it's helpful to know that the monitor is working!The picture quality is pretty okay.

And the screen went blank on it's own. It's an easy fix and I suggest keeping an eye on the monitor when you have it on battery power.

If he wakes up at night and fusses, I turn the monitor on to see if he really needs me or just needs to go back to sleep. He's at the stage now where he plays in his crib when he wakes up from a nap. It gives me peace of mind to be able to keep an eye on him.Setting up was a breeze! We hung the camera on the wall next to his crib, turned everything on, and we had video! You can pair the monitor with multiple cameras, but we are only using one at this time.The picture quality is fine, and the night vision works great. The voice activation is a nice feature to save the battery.My only negative comment is that after six months, the battery on the monitor does not keep its charge. It used to last for 4-5 hours. Now it lasts 2-3. This isn't a deal breaker for me, though.

The camera is small enough that it doesn't look ridiculous (we mounted it on the wall by his crib) and has awesome picture quality (even w/ the night vision feature). The handheld portion is lightweight (almost seems cheap..but so far no issues) and again AWESOME picture quality. My only complaint is the battery life of the monitor. THe camera stays plugged in so that obviously does not die, but the monitor portion loses battery life fairly quickly. We keep ours plugged in all night but if we try to keep it on all day it dies. My advice would be to turn it off when your baby is not napping to conserve the battery. We only have this issue on weekends when he is napping at home (otherwise during the week he is at daycare and we only use it at night). All in all an awesome product.

The camera itself can tell whether or not its dark or light thus automatically switching to night mode when needed. Having a nightlight on does. It impair the video at all on night vision which was a concern of minebefore purchasing but glad to find it not a problem.and the night lights i have are super bright.

buy.It displays color in day time, black & white/gray scale in night time and also transmits any small sounds the baby makes to alert you.  It supports upto 3 additional cameras so that you can monitor different kids/babies/other kids in different rooms or just as a security camera.What is not so good ?  * The Unit is cheaply built  * Not good viewing angle - just 20 deg tilt will blur out the image  * Does not support WIfi - means if you want to watch your kids/babies being taken care by a baby sitter you cannot do it.  If it were Wifi enabled, then you could have watched your kids/babies and baby sitter from your iphone/ipadBTW - setup is very easy, infact virtually no setup required.", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Low price for great monitor", "Author": "Sizsaw", "ReviewID": "R3F0GQ4K54DJ88", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent hours looking at the reviews to decide which monitor to get.

It's exactly what I wanted. I didn't need a camera that could play lullabies or that I could talk to baby through the monitor. I just wanted to be able to see and hear her from the other room.I had one complaint which was that the stand the camera comes on tilts the camera up and I couldn't figure out why it was built that way. When are you ever going to need the camera to look up to see the baby? The camera can swivel left to right but I was propping the stand up on a rag to tilt it down. Then, yesterday, I realized you can tilt the camera down without moving the stand. (Again, new mom brain or I might have realized this earlier.) So the camera is perfection!I understand what people mean by \"cheap plastic feel\" but I really don't care. It performs well. That's all that matters to me. I'm not sure what people mean when they talk about the monitor beeping at them. The only time my monitor beeps is if I turn the camera off but the monitor is still on, which makes sense. If the camera goes out, you want the monitor to let you know.The only other thing I would note is that the monitor doesn't really give you a heads up on battery life. It just starts blinking and then within a few minutes it dies so you have to plug it in to turn it back on. I've just made allowances for this and make sure to plug the monitor in whenever I'm not using it so when I do need it I can carry it from room to room with me.So glad to save money AND get exactly what I wanted.

At just $30 more to add the video feature, this is a must-have. We won't be turning back to audio monitors ever again.The VOX mode is really nice.

Christensen \"my review\"", "ReviewID": "R38H7MIHQ65W26", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Monitor works great but it essentially shuts down the wifi in my home when the monitor is in use.  I have tried what it said in the trouble shooting guide and it does not work.  I have manually moved my router to each of the 13 channels available on the 2.4GHZ spectrum and it still hasn't done anything to alleviate the issue.  I read a bunch of reviews where the monitor did not interfere with the wifi and I have a feeling that it's probably because of the design of my house.  If the router and camera were on opposite sides of my house it would probably not be an issue for me but as it stands they are in rooms that sit next to each other.  I have a newer router that I purchased on amazon (medialink 802.11n) so I don't think it has anything to do with the routers age or the firmware that's installed on it (which is up to date).The wifi interference doesn't show up as wifi disconnected or the inability to connect to your wifi network.  When the monitor is on the wifi signal strength remains the same as if it were off.  The interference shows up in the form of packet loss.  Doing a speed test with the monitor on yielded an initial burst of 3Mbps which after about 3 seconds degraded until the test fails to finish.  With the monitor off the speed test comes through at 18-20Mbps and the test completes as it should.  Anything that taxes your connection or attempts to consume a constant amount of bandwidth (downloads, gaming, streaming, speedtests) deteriorates the connection until it is unusable.  Standard web traffic for the most part goes through just fine with some noticeable slowness but it still loads most pages.I have contacted Infant Optics tech support to see if this monitor jumps channels and have yet to hear anything back.

I am so used to dealing with rather poor customer service when it comes to baby products (don't even get me started on when our son's crib was recalled!), that I just have to thank Infant Optics and specifically, Candice Monique, for their five star customer service. Now to rate the product itself. I WISH we had purchased this for our first born. I can't tell you the peace of mind this video monitor gives me with our 5 month old. Our kids are sharing a bedroom, and with this monitor, I can keep an eye on our infant without waking up the toddler. It's fantastic! And now it'll be even better once it's portable. Every parent with a new born should have this monitor.

We liked the night vision mode as well - the picture is crisp enough to make out everything that is needed.We have encountered two major problems with this device:1. The battery life is not long (which is to be expected with 2.4GHz and a screen like this) - only a few hours, but what's worse is that battery dies without any warning. Once too often we found ourselves thinking that the baby is fast asleep only to discover moments later that the monitor is turned off and the baby is wide awake and seeking attention actively. So, the device is only reliable with wall socket connection.2. The device interferes with WiFi networks when turned on (either both sides or only the transmitter). What's worse, it does this in completely unpredictable fashion - you can work with no problems for hours and then all of a sudden your devices will be able to connect to the network but will not be able to download anything or will download very slowly.

Here's what I like:*Easy set up - Plug it in, turn it on, and you are good to go.  The camera unit also mounts easily to the wall, which is great if you're looking for a \"bird's eye\" view of your baby in the crib.*Decent image - The image is clear enough and refreshes often enough that I can actually see my son breathing, even in night vision mode.*You can mute the sound while leaving the video on - My kid is old enough now that I don't want to hear every breath, grunt or roll.  I like that I can leave the video on at night without having to listen to every little thing going on in there.  Surprisingly, a lot of the video monitors that I looked at do not have a video on/sound off feature.*Excellent value - Seriously.

I'm constantly knocking it over (especially at night, when I'm bleary eyed and reaching for the monitor), and it's fallen over spontaneously a few times.  Not a deal breaker, but annoying nonetheless.*The VOX feature comes on automatically each time you turn the monitor on - This is really just a small nit (and likely individual to my preferences), but I wish I could just change the default to leave the VOX feature off.

The quality of the video is perfect, even in pitch black it looks like theres a light on in the room. I was very surprised at how well the night vision worked. Slight downfall is the sound doesnt work very well, its automatically voice activated so the only time the sound will come on is if the baby actually cries or makes a somewhat loud noise unlike audio monitors which you can here the covers moving or baby breathing or something. But considering this is a video monitor it doesnt really make a big deal that the sound isnt great..not to say you shouldnt get this monitor if your worried about the sound! It does work fine! I'm just not particularly fond of the voice activation setup, i prefer the sound be constantly on. But the video is so amazingly clear, i guess you dont really need sound anyways since you can always see your little ones every move! I would highly recommend buying this monitor over any others because I'm guessing any other monitor around this price range will not be as great of quality and you really dont need to buy anything more expensive than this one because this one has everything you need in a video monitor..including multiple camera function if you wanted to buy the extra cameras for it which I definitley will!

In addition to the cheap quality feel, I didn't like how it constantly put itself into sleep mode to save battery power. It states that it will turn back on when the baby starts crying, which is true. However, the microphone doesn't pick up the baby's sounds unless they are really loud. Unfortunately, if the baby is awake and talking quietly, the microphone will not pick this up.

Even with level on 9(the hightest) it's not enough. I had to constantly held it to my ear to hear something. If you are doing dishes forget it, laundry forget it, watch tv - don't even think about it. Also most newer monitor has a visual sound level indicator (green low noise - red loud noise).

It now just beeps and goes out of signal constantly. Another complaint is that the screen is way too bright even on the lowest setting and keeps me up at night if I keep it on. I do like the VOX feature but that doesn't always work, especially if you keep a fan in the baby's room. Lastly, our battery stopped working after just a couple weeks of use.

Yes, the \"feel\" of the product isn't as heavy and feels a bit \"cheap\", but who cares! For a product that is about $150 cheaper, what does it matter that the plastic is lighter weight?So far, the one issue I'm not liking is the fact that the sound level of the monitor is much quieter than our old (Summer Infant... an ancient model) video monitor unit. Even with the volume at full blast, the sound is fairly quiet. For the three-year old, that's not such a big deal. However, i am a tad bit worried that I won't wake up with the baby unless she is screaming her lungs off. During the day, the sound level is no issue. I'm just worried that it's too quiet to wake me up at night. I suppose time will tell.All in all, this monitor is great for the money, easy to use, doesn't have a million extra bells and whistles that you're paying for, and the picture quality is great.

It was a great product, thoughtfully designed and with the exact set of features needed. Unfortunately that product has been taken out of the market and the  Infant Optics DXR-5 seemed to be a good replacement. We have had this for about 2 months now and it seems to be adequate for our needs. Having said that, I'm not comfortable giving it more than 3 stars for a few reasons1. Price: Definitely the #1 reason for purchasing this product, There are hardly any sub-100 day/night video monitors out there2. Design: Pretty nice looking, but does definitely feel flimsy and rather lightly constructed. One annoying quality is that the camera has a pretty limited degree of motion because of a rather strange hinge-like contraption that holds the lens. It is a little annoying to position it right and get adequate coverage of whatever you are trying to cover (the crib in our case).3. Picture/Sound: Again, these are pretty adequate and the night time is definitely a lot grainier than our old monitor. My wife sometimes calls it the ultrasound picture (to be fair, it is not that bad :-) ). The sound (very) occasionally cuts off and then comes back. I'm guessing this is more to do with connectivity between the camera and the monitor4. There have been some comments in this thread about how bright the camera is on account of the night-vision. Frankly we have not seen that nor has out kid been distracted/disturbed by this. We have a relatively bright night-light in the room, so he may be used to some light5. We turned off the other features like Vox, power-save shutoff etc. The manual has clear instructions on how to do so. I have seen quite a few negative ratings on account of this. I cannot comment on the features themselves since I turned them off, but they are easy to turn off and (atleast IMO) should not be the deciding factor against this", "Date": "July 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Check your router before buying", "Author": "JB \"JB\"", "ReviewID": "R2346G79G79AA0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm sure this is a great baby monitor but it wouldn't turn on for us at all because our router interfered with it. \"Out of Signal Coverage\" is all we saw so we have to sell it since we are outside of the return range.

It has been great.  It is the perfect BASIC video monitor, and I think people forget that it is a BASIC video monitor. Heck, it's only $99!There are other reviews on here that complain about screen size and when the monitor turns on due noise or lack of motion.  The screen size is fine for what it does.  I don't need some HD top of the line screen.  Just something that I can see if my child is awake on.All I can say is that with as much noise as a baby makes and as much as a baby moves in the middle of the night I would not want it to go on every single time, no one would ever sleep because the monitor would be turning on every 5 minutes!  Now our bed room is close to our child's room so I can hear when he makes small noises and I am fine with it not turning on, but if he crys, coughs, sneezes, it turns on.  But that is good enough for me.The only con would be the beep the monitor makes when you have the sound turned on when it goes into VOX power saving mode.  It is a bit annoying, but at night we sleep with the sound off because like I said we can usually hear everything from his room, and I am such a light sleeper that the light turning on is enough to wake me up.Overall I love our little monitor.

We are going to continue to use the monitor for now (once we receive the new battery).  Once the review was written the company was very fast acting to rectify the situation which was great and showed their customer service as a high priority which is nice to see.I ordered this after reading the reviews and thought we would be happy.  Well, our son is only 6 weeks old, and has only slept in his room 8 days, and the monitor is dead already!!!  I'm soooooooooooo upset about this.  It keeps turning off, and not going to VOX, but actually turning off.  Then it won't turn on when he's crying. If not plugged in, it only stays on, maybe 20 minutes.  And last night it was turning off even when it was plugge din. Might I add that his bedroom is on the 2nd floor and ours is on the first, so between him being fussy and colicky we're already run upstairs enough.  Don't need this added issue.So I emailedInfant Optics.  There first response was that \"as with all electronics, batteries will die if kept below 50 degrees.\"  What!?!?  Where the heck do you think i'm keeping this monitor, outside?!?!?  So I wrote back and said that wasn't it.  So then I was told I had two options.  1- order a new one from amazon and return this one. 2- send this one to infant optics and they will send another.My big concern to them was that I'm then without a monitor at all, for probably at least a week if not more.

It has simple (yet awesome) features that I have recently found as well, like a built in clip/stand on the monitor unit so that it can be placed within view on the nightstand. The night vision is also great as our son is extremely light sensitive and won't asleep unless it's dark. Another plus is that it doesn't use WiFi to send the video feed so there is no worries of anyone hacking into the connection.The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is that the monitor's auto stand by and auto mute functions don't work with the sound machine we use (the sound keeps it on and we can always hear the machine through the monitor).Overall, we would definitely recommend this to friends and family!

Instead of buying an audio monitor and then a video one later for sleep training, we just bought this cause what can be better at $99!- There is nothing on the market that beats this price.- The set up is super easy - you really just plug it in and the camera and monitor find each other and you're good to go.- The sound and picture clarity is very good.- We took it when we traveled.  We even took it to India and it worked in a duplex house.  We could keep an eye on the kids - it really is a life-saver.2.  I love the company too cause their customer service was impeccable:- Not only did they respond quickly, they were polite, helpful and understanding.- It's great to see small companies making quality products and doing good work.

However, I still tell all my mommy friends in need of a video monitor about the DXR-5! It is fairly inexpensive for a great product.I accidentally dropped our monitor on a very hard cement floor and broke the antenna cover.

I have 3 other children and only used a Sony monitor for them, but this is great!  I can watch in my room and see if he is just making noises or if he is making noises and kicking his legs or turning his head (signs that I can go and give him a pacifier).  If he is just making noises and I get up and go in the room to give a pacifier and he is actually asleep--well, that's just annoying.  I mounted it up on the ceiling looking down into his crib.  At night the picture is black and white, but color in the daylight.  The resolution is not good enough (at the distance I have it from the crib---about 9 feet) to be able to watch him breathe, but I can see well enough to make sure there isn't a blanket over his face or if the paci is in his mouth.  The audio is sound activated only so it isn't on all the time---only if he makes enough noise.  I like sound on all the time when they are little (mine is 8 weeks right now) so I have a Sony baby monitor in there also and the two do not interfere with each other.I have my wifi Kindle fire within 2 feet of the monitor without a problem.  There are a lot of options for angling the camera that I didn't know about until I opened the instruction booklet.  :o)  Also, if you buy an extra camera they are super easy to set up, but do NOT come with the camera stand like this one does.  Also, this camera comes paired with the unit out of the box so no set up required.  It is super easy to pair additional cameras to the monitor though.

That night, as my husband and I were soundly sleeping, suddenly the monitor beeped loudly and reported that it was out of range, and wouldn't connect even when I was on the other side of the door from the camera unit.  I finally got it to connect and dropped sleepily into bed, until later that night when it happened again! We ended up shutting it off.  The second day was better, though I experienced some interference with my phone, and had to separate them by 6 feet or more.  Which made it a pain tp walk around the house.  On the third day, the receiver suddenly reported it was out of range again (I was only on the other side of a thin wall from the camera) and wouldn't connect no matter what I tried. After several hours of beeping and frustration, I gave up and got another brand of video monitor, which worked perfectly and still is, 30 days later. I'm not sure if my experience is a fluke, but it sure was frustrating!I was also struck by how \"cheap\" the receiver felt in my hand, and I was afraid to handle it too roughly in case it might break. There are also bright red lights on the camera unit that lit up my son's room, which isn't too concerning, but the second unit we got (Motorola) doesn't have those lights.  I also did not like how \"tinny\" the sounds were coming from the monitor - it didn't sound anything like my son's voice and was kind of creepy.  The auto-on feature was cool, but it doesn't have a way to only have audio, so in the middle of the night when he coughed, our room lit up with the bright screen for a while (waking me up every time).  Also, the \"out of range\" beep was SUPER loud and obnoxious, and would continue to beep every few seconds until it re-connected.  It seemed to take a really long time to reconnect, so I wasn't ever sure if I was within range again, or just needed to wait longer.All those problems are not present with our new video monitor (Motorola), so I am very happy to have paid $50 more for our new one to avoid those frustrations.", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Can't beat for price and quality", "Author": "Rayna Rhode", "ReviewID": "RW9FH45887Q9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This has been an awesome investment.

It is very clear that many users did NOT read the directions.There are three ways to use this monitor.1. With video and sound on at all times (Yes, It will drain the battery quickly).2. With video turning off after 3 minutes of no sound above 60 dB (Therefore, conserving battery by not continually showing the video).  *It will turn back on if it senses loud sounds (baby crying, yelling).3. With video AND sound off - only turning on when there are loud sounds heard. (This is what other monitors call \"sleep mode\"...so that the parents aren't hearing the baby moving around in the crib...only the sounds that need to be heard at night).If you're having problems with no sound, or not video, or it cutting in and out.  READ THE DIRECTIONS.Now.....why am I returning it?1. There is a constant \"hum\" and \"crackling\" sound coming from the parent unit.  It didn't matter that I turned off my wifi.  It continued to happen.  I know a lot of users complained that this messed up their wifi...well I don't know if mine did or not. I even followed the directions in the manual to fix the problem. I can tell you that it continued to happen despite my router being turned off.  And it didn't matter how close or far away I was from the camera with the parent unit, so it wasn't a reception problem either.2.  The video quality wasn't as good as I expected.  There was a lot of \"noise\"....you photographer people will understand.3.  Even on the highest volume setting - it was hard to hear my daughter.  The high setting on this monitor compared to low-medium volume setting of my old monitor.4.  The manual states to point the antennae down if you have this monitor on a higher floor.  That way it's always pointed down toward the below floors where you most likely will be with the parent unit.  Well now you can't turn the camera on and off.  The antennae blocks it.5.  It's light weight and cheap feeling.  I have a feeling that if my toddler accidentally got a hold of it once...it'd be toast.

It was a baby shower gift. I really don't understand why it is so popular when there are MUCH better options out there for the same price.First off, this camera interferes with our wifi. That may not be the case for you, as every configuration is different, but very frustrating nevertheless.Design flaw #1 is the antenna sticking out. It will break. If you ever drop it, that thing will be the first to go.Next, we have battery. My goal isn't to talk anyone out of buying this monitor, because it works OK...I just want to give you a few warnings and tips. Buy an extra battery when you purchase this. I tried buying a replacement locally, and couldn't get one anywhere including battery only stores and Radio Shack.Cords. Buy half a dozen to start with. This monitor has the worst connection jack on the receiver.  Just from the normal charging, it will wear out every couple of months. I think I purchased 4-6 of these cables. They are cheap, and Amazon has them...so do yourself a favor and get a few to have on hand.The biggest feature lacking is the static placement of it, meaning you can't remote control to change angles. So, when you go in to move it so you can see...at 3am, you wake the baby (feedback in the receiver).For nearly the same price you can buy the Foscam FBM3501. No antenna to break off. The charging jacks aren't cheap so you're not buying cords all the time. You can remote control the angle, zoom in when you can't quite see something, set a reminder for feedings, see the temperature of the room on the display...not to mention the LCD is bigger and has better night vision. VOX mode also has three sensitivity settings, unlike the one on the Infant Optics.The angle stand on the Infant Optics is also complete garbage and it falls all the time (so that's when you break the antenna).Bottom line? We're talking about two totally different classes of monitors here.

Unfortunatly it was a defective product that broke the second time we turned it on.  It feels like a cheaply made product and customer service was extremely difficult to work with to get the issue resolve.  Stay Away!We were excited to recieve it as a gift in the mail one day and immediately opened it up and tried the set up.  We're we sorely disappointed.  First of all it's very cheap quality feel and I just had a bad feeling from the get go. Each piece has a cord adapter to plug in and I found the set up to be a little difficult especially with the camera. Once we got it plugged in you have to synch the camera to the monitor and it was difficlut to get it to synch.  Lots of annoying, loud beeping as we tried and tried and finally got it to synch.  Then it would un-synch for no reason so we tried again.  The camera itself is difficult to place so that you can actually see your baby.  It points upward but we wanted to place it on an adjacent dresser and point it down into the crib.  Well that required using an extra stand/adapter that they provide, but it's extremely flimsy and tips easily.  Also the placement of the on/off button of right where you want to hold it so just picking up the camera means you're probably going to turn the camera off or on by accident, AND have to go through the whole synch process all over again.  BUT unfortunately when I turned it on again the camera didn't turn on at all.  I couldn't get to work.So the next day I called customer service and they had me test to see if it was the adapter cord or the actual camera.  I determined that it was the adapter and called them back at which point they asked me for the details of the order.  Well, I knew this was going to be complicated becasue it's a gift.  She refused to send me a new adapter until I was able to provide this order information. Why, when a company has a defective product, do I feel like I have to do all the recovery work for them and explain myself.So now I have to call the kind, generous person who purchased the product for us and explain that their gift was defective and ask them to find the order information in their email and send it to me, so Infant Optics can enter it into their system and send me an adapter that probably costs them 50 cents.  Even when I finally get the adapter probably well after our baby is born, I'm not going to be happy with this product.I really wish I had gone with the Dropcam and probably will just end up buying it anyway.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for...", "Author": "KYgirl5", "ReviewID": "RX1BNOEE4FOL1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Previously we had a summer infant video monitor.

At one point, the power cord stopped connecting with the monitor (We must have wrapped it around itself one too many times), and I just figured we had worn it out and after the 8 months of serious daily use, that we should get another.

I learned to keep it on the \"VOX off\" setting and it no longer clicks, the image just stays on.  Even on the lowest brightness setting it's still bright for me so I wear an eye mask.The biggest flaw in my opinion is that there are 8 red lights on the camera component which stay on all night.  My baby stares at these lights, transfixed, and cannot get to sleep.  There is also a bright green \"night light\" on the top of the camera which is also too bright.  We ended up putting a few pieces of blue painters tape over the green light and that has helped.

Audio quality is crystal clear. Never had any problems with static. You can mount the camera on the wall or use the included stand.There is no audio warning if the battery is going to die on the parent unit. Just a flashing light. Which doesn't help you if you forget to plug in the unit and it dies while you are asleep. The monitor does however make a very annoying beep noise on the parent unit before going into sleep mode. There is no way to turn this off. Those would be my complaints.The camera does not turn unless you do it manually. And while you can buy additional cameras, the parent unit does not \"scan\" automatically between those camera. This means you only see or hear one camera at a time, even in the night.As with all baby monitors, we do have some issues with it slowing down our wifi.

I leave it plugged in during the nighttime and keep it on all night. That way I don't hear it turning on and off and it waking me up. I keep it at a volume that I can hear if our baby wakes up, but also that allows me to sleep.

He's 2.5 years old and starting to skip his naps, so I wanted to see if he was standing up or trying to climb out of his crib or anything like that. I wanted something relatively inexpensive (mid-range) that works without interference, nothing fussy or difficult to use with a zillion buttons and controls.Well, I got what I wanted! This little monitor feels light and cheap, but it works just fine. The plastic casing and everything feels cheap and I'm worried that if I dropped it everything would crack, but so far, so good. I really like how the video camera can be mounted in different ways and a little stand comes with it if you need to set it up high and look down. Because the camera is so light, it tends to tip forward, so I had to secure it with some masking tape to make sure it doesn't fall off the shelf, startling my son in the middle of the night. The monitor itself is easy to use and the picture is fine. I can see what he's doing and that's enough for me. Also we do have WIFI in the house and a medley of other electronics, and I've never encountered interference.The audio though, is REALLY bad.

We have a white noise machine going in his room and I don't hear that at all. Even so, the audio sounds tinny and buzzy, really poor quality. We have an Angelcare monitor which we only use for audio now (the sensor pad was nice for the first 6 months but useless now....and it is under a recall....), and the Angelcare monitor's audio quality is by far better.Some features that would have been nice to have:1) A real on-off button with a physical \"click\" when the camera turns on and some clear indication whether the machine is on or off. Right now the on-off switch is a button which you depress to turn on and you press the same button once to turn off. A tiny tiny light turns on in the base of the camera to show that it is on, but in a rush, sometimes I don't notice it. Then I leave the room and find that the camera wasn't on, and it's too late to go back in to turn it back on because I would wake my son up. I need a real switch with color coding or something obvious so I KNOW the camera is on.2) Pan and tilt. For the price, I understand that this is beyond the little camera's pay-scale.3) A heavier, no-tip base for the camera.All in all, for the price, it's good enough. It does what I need it to do, no complaints. I haven't used it for long enough yet to know how durable it is. If you need a video monitor that can pick up enough noise to know if your child is crying, good. But if you are the type who wants to sit there and listen carefully to what your child is saying in the next room, this is not the device for you because of the poor audio quality.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great value and works well", "Author": "Janell", "ReviewID": "R14RTBA4BYYUYR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this video monitor after a bad experience with a different brand that had a similar price point.

The product is very nicely priced compared to other camera systems.  I have a two story house and my daughter lives on the top floor in the back and am able to go out well into my front yard without any issues.  The camera is very clear and I LOVE the night vision. I'm actually able to take pictures of the video monitor on my cell phone and they are still clear in both day and night.  I have not used any other camera system so I can not compare quality, but for less that $100 this camera is amazing.  The best feature is the auto screen off (VOX on/off) that after a certain amount of quiet time the screen blacks out until noise is detected.  This makes my room stay dark at night and is a good indication if you can't be right by the camera all the time.  I recently took it camping and was able to set it up inside and see the screen flicker on if my daughter woke up.  You are able to set up four camera but I do wish the cameras were a little cheaper (one camera is as much as the whole system) so I haven't tried this feature. This unit does cause interference if you are an Xbox gamer using Turtle Beach headphones (which probably doesn't apply to many of you but for those it does the interference is annoying but manageable if you move the two systems around), but I don't even know its on with other WiFi using electronics.  This also has a one year hassle free warranty (my unit recently stopped working and they sent a new one out very quickly even before receiving my old one) which is pretty good and the customer service representatives are so very nice and friendly.

We've been using it in conjunction with our Angel Care monitor. I did a LOT of research on many different brands and types of video monitors out there, but when it came down to it, this one seemed to have everything we were looking for and I'm so glad it's the one we chose!We already have a fantastic baby monitor with the Angel Care unit so we didn't need all the \"bells and whistles\" of some of the more expensive video units out there. Just wanted to be able to see her and have a unit that was easy to travel with. The Angel Care is not a very portable system. The Infant Optics DXR-5 sets up super easily and transmits a very clear image of our child whether her room is full of light or completely dark. The resolution was much better than I expected for a unit of this price and though there's a bit of lag within the video feedback, it's so little that you don't really notice it. It's certainly not a problem. We've used it in our apartment and various family members' homes including my in-law's very large house and it continued to receive a signal without a problem, on a completely different floor. One complaint I've seen on these reviews was the \"plasticy\" feel of the unit. It's true that it's all a light weight plastic but in my opinion it doesn't feel flimsy to me. I'm not sure what people expect for $99. I've handled units twice this much and they don't feel that different. The \"flimsiest\" part of the unit to me is the plastic flip-out prop on the back of the monitor. It folds and clicks in to lay the monitor flat and then pulls out with a click to prop the monitor up. I'm gentle with that. Otherwise, it doesn't seem fragile. This monitor has accompanied us on multiple flights and road trips, tucked into our suitcases, and hasn't sustained any damage.If you're looking for an affordable baby video monitor which simply does what it's supposed to do -- offer a good, clear, reliable, video feed for a great price, look no further.

It can also easily be removed from the wall (without worrying about messing with nails or holes in the wall), so we've also taken it with us on domestic and international trips. When we travel with it, we don't worry about trying to install it on a wall--we just hang it over the corner of the crib or pack n'play, adjust the angle of the camera, and it gets the job done. We can't live with out it. The picture is sharp, the sound can be as soft or as loud as you need it to be, and there are nifty auto-mute and auto-LED settings that you can activate with the touch of a button. It also starts beeping to let you know if the battery is low. The monitor worked perfectly until one day the sound stopped working. We contacted the manufacturer asking if we could be sent a replacement unit, and they responded back to us the next day. They first walked us through how to test the unit to see if it was the camera that malfunctioned or the monitor. Once we figured out the issue, the customer service representative said she would be happy to send us a brand new unit. All we had to do was provide our original Amazon order number, and proof that we had shipped the unit back to the manufacturer. We sent her a scanned copy of the UPS receipt, and that very same day she put in a request for a replacement unit, and expedited the shipping. We received the replacement unit less than 2 days later, which means we were only without a baby monitor for a total of 2 days. That was so important to us since we use the monitor everyday. We were terrified that we would have to wait weeks for a replacement unit, but Infant Optics was so helpful and responsive. We were also thankful that we received a brand new unit, rather than a refurbished unit, which many other companies tend to do. We were amazed at the high level of customer service. To top everything off, the customer service representative reached out to us about 1 week later just to check in and make sure the replacement unit was functioning correctly and that we were satisfied. Another great plus: InfantOptics makes it very easy to register your product for their one-year warranty--you just have to go to their website and put in your information and the Amazon order number.

Being able to see her seemed important to know whether she was staying in the bed or had crawled or fallen out. She also sometimes cries out in the night but very quickly puts herself back to sleep so seeing her on the video allows us to judge whether we need to go into her room or whether she is fine on her own.I did not want to pay $250+ for a video monitor so I opted for this version after reading many reviews online. You get what you pay for, and this is one of the more inexpensive options in video baby monitors. The reviews that say that this monitor has a cheap, plastic feel are absolutely correct. I worry a little about the stand on the receiver snapping off. This version has a VOX mode, which allows the monitor to go to sleep when there has been no sound above a certain decibel for 3 minutes. I really appreciate that feature because it means that we don't have to contend with the light from the screen in our bedroom at night. HOWEVER, we have found that the monitor does not always wake up from VOX mode when our toddler cries. The battery life is also very short. We absolutely have to keep the monitor plugged in overnight.The night vision is blurry but adequate for our toddler. We can tell if she's lying down in bed, sitting up, or out of the bed, and that's about all we care about at this point. If you really feel like you need to see more detail than that, buy a better monitor.Overall, I don't regret buying this model. If our daughter were younger, I would have bought something more reliable, with clearer night vision, and a sturdier build with a couple of receivers (one for upstairs and one for downstairs), but at this point, she is mostly beyond needing to be monitored.When our daughter was an infant, we used the Sony Baby Call (no video), and that worked fine for us.

So you are sitting there thinking all is well because you hear nothing...and then you glance at the monitor again and realize it turned itself off and the baby is wiggling her arms and waking up.3- It doesn't even have a charging station. It just has a crappy plug in adapter. It would be great to have a stand to sit it in so you could have it standing up in front of you, but I find myself having to hold it to view the image.4- The cord that came with the camera attachment was ridiculously short.

If you push the resolution button and the volume button at the same time you can turn off this feature and the baby monitor will pick up all noises. We ended up taking this feature off as our son got older and no longer cried when he woke up. It has some good features, the picture quality is very good and it has a long range too. It is very easy to see the baby in a completely dark room and there are only a few red led lights visible on the monitor as to keep the babies room dark. There is no annoying white noise sound when the monitor is on either. The only problem we have with this monitor is that it interferes with our wifi signal (it informs you on the box that it can).

We decided to get a video monitor and this one looked like a great value.  We have used it for 2 weeks and here are my observations:PROS:-Easy to use.  I love how easy it is to toggle VOX on/off.-Auto-mute feature is great.  After 5 seconds of no noise, the auto-mute kicks in (you can turn this feature off) so there is no white noise.-Decent picture.  I was able to see my son well during naps and at night.CONS:-You cannot pan or zoom the camera. I understand that most baby video monitors don't pan or zoom MUCH, but there is something about staring at the screen of your baby that makes you WANT to move the camera.  Maybe a side effect of having a smartphone..-When on VOX mode, after 5 minutes of \"quiet\", the monitor goes to sleep and will come back on automatically when noise is detected.  When the monitor goes to sleep, it switches from the black & white picture (mostly grey) to the white start-up/shut-down screen before going black.  This flash of white woke me up several times.  I eventually turned the parent unit face-down on my nightstand so I couldn't see this \"flash\".-When the volume is turned all the way down, there is no \"beep\" to alert you of a lost connection with the camera.  For example, if you have the volume turned all the way down, there is a power outage, power comes back on (camera stays off until you turn it back on manually), there is no beep to indicate that you have lost connection w/ the camera.-Similarly, when the volume is turned all the way down, the parent unit doesn't beep to alert you that the battery is dying.  That is a major design flaw, in my opinion.All in all, I wasn't thrilled with the monitor, but was willing to live with it because this is a great price.  However, after four days of use, my video display completely malfunctioned.  When displaying black/white at night, it now either displays black/hot pink or neon green/white.  I am sure I just got a lemon and could easily exchange this for another, but I plan to exchange this for a different brand instead.

This is by no means a full featured monitor that will meet everyone's needs; however, if you can live with its shortcomings it is a good video monitor for the price.We use a sound machine in our baby's room, so the VOX and auto mute features of the monitor are not useful for us.  We tested these features with the sound machine off and they worked as described.  Since VOX does not work, the battery only lasts for 3 to 5 hours because the video is always on.  We usually have the monitor plugged in by late afternoon and it is always plugged in overnight.  If the battery gets low, then the monitor beeps very loudly.There is no on/off switch or button for the video.  Our workaround for that is to turn the night vision camera off by pushing the volume down and contrast down buttons at the same time.  The video is still on, but at least the screen is dark enough for us to sleep at night.  Signal strength is good within the house and we get a signal within 15 feet of the house outside.  Good enough for taking the monitor out into the yard.  We have not had problems with wifi interference.  When put in close proximity with our Summer Infant monitor, the summer infant monitor loses signal.  We cannot keep the two monitors together on the same nightstand.There is an on/off button on the camera.  If the camera loses power for any reason, you have to push the button to turn the camera back on.  With our summer infant monitors, the cameras are always on when plugged in.  After mounting this camera high up on the wall, I can only hope that we won't need to access the camera very often to turn it back on.  My guess is that this will be a rare inconvenience.The video quality is surprisingly good for the price of this monitor.  The night vision quality is also very good (we have the contrast set at the highest level 5).  Not as good as our first Summer Infant monitor purchased in 2010, but still very good.  The sound quality is also very good.  The monitor itself is lightweight.  The construction quality is ok.  I have concerns about whether it could withstand being dropped.  The belt clip that doubles as a stand is made of very thin plastic and seems like it could break very easily.  We don't plan to ever use the belt clip; the monitor is small enough to fit in a coat pocket.We have been using this monitor for less than a month and reliability has been good so far.  Once I woke up in the middle of the night to find the screen covered with green pixels and the sound was not working.  Powering the unit off and back on cleared that up.  A couple of times during the day the monitor has restarted on its own.For the price, this monitor is a good value if the available features meet your needs.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bought two", "Author": "dmcginn2", "ReviewID": "R1QVU84IE8NL3Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have been using this monitor for a couple years.

We returned that as well because it didn\u2019t make sense to button it down to a baby!

Our baby is turning one soon and I am so glad we bought this unit and stayed with it! We put it on 'Vox On' and the monitor comes on only when baby makes any noise or if there is a noise in the room. Sometimes it even picks up a noisy motor vehicle on the road! It gives me a lot of freedom and I am not constantly monitoring etc. I get great signal reception all around my house including the basement and also outside in the yard which works great for me!Recently I was beginning to have issues with the monitor\u2019s adapter and would not have bothered to contact the seller if I had an adapter I could use, but I couldn't so I reached out to them and they were great!

It worked, now he would still be awake when we put him down and he would entertain himself until he falls asleep by himself. This camera saved our lives (and our good night sleep)! With our daughter, we only got the audio monitor type of some other brand and we failed to sleep train her (and still paying the price, she still sleeps together with us in the same bedroom, but different bed).

I am blown away by the level of service she provided. To add, she was very courteous and friendly (which is rare these days).There was another occasion where I thought the night vision was broken so I emailed her back. She asked if I might have turned the Infra Red option off (something I wasn't aware I could do at the time), otherwise if the camera was broken, they would gladly send a replacement camera. Turns out I did accidentally turned the Infra Red option off (If you press the \"-\" on both volume and brightness button simultaneously, it toggles the IR on and off - the screen would show \"IR ON\" or \"IR OFF\" or \"IR AUTO.\") so a replacement was not necessary!Bottom line, it works, it's very affordable, but the most important aspect of all, superb customer service.

The screen is very clear, and it works great.  Being a paranoid new mom, I am easily able to see that baby is still breathing.  You can adjust the brightness and volume easily.  There is a setting that allows you to keep the sound muted and it automatically un-mutes when baby cries or there is an unusual noise in the room.  This is a great feature, it saves you from listening to static all night long when baby is sleeping soundly.  There is a similar feature for the screen, but I personally prefer to keep the screen on.  I have never had a problem with the unit malfunctioning.  You can even use multiple cameras with the one monitor unit.  It is very portable; I can charge it and clip it right to my belt loop or set in on a table or nightstand near by.  There is no dragging cords around the house or having to keep it plugged in.  I have even dropped it a few times and it never broke!  It is surprisingly durable for being made of plastic.  However, my clumsy bulldog knocked it over 2 nights ago and the screen got pushed in on one side and it no longer holds a charge.  I have to have it plugged into an outlet or it shuts off.  (I am surprised it even worked at all after that, but it did!)  Since we live in a 2 story home, it is very inconvenient to unplug it and plug it back in every time I go up or down the stairs.  I contacted the Infant optics company via email and received a prompt response.  The representative that replied to my email, Mae, was very helpful and addressed all my concerns.  I was able to exchange the broken unit for a brand new one.  They didn't give me the run around or make me jump through hoops.  It was prompt and simple, and they even ship the new one before they receive the defective one!  Best customer service experience I have had in a long time.  They seem to be a great company and I have recommended this product to friends.CONS:The only cons with this monitor is that the lowest brightness setting could stand to be a bit lower and the buttons are all very loud.  The brightness/volume buttons range from 0 (the lowest setting) to 9 (the highest setting).  The buttons don't allow you to push and hold to turn it all the way up or down.  For example, if you had the volume all the way up to 9 and wanted to mute it, you would have to click the down button 9 times and its really loud.  It actually wakes my husband up sometimes if I change these settings in the night.  A mute button would be nice, as would quieter buttons, but it isn't that big of a deal considering how well the product works!

So far so good. We've been using it every night for a month and it's been working great.PROS:* Very affordable compared to many other baby video monitors! Literally half the price of other cameras and from what I gather really no significant reduction in quality or features.* Pairing the monitor to the camera is straightforward and simple.* The audio sensor is smart in what it picks up and what it ignores. We have a ticking wall clock in my son's room, but that never sets the audio sensor off. Also, if my wife or I go in there and whisper it rarely sets it off. But my son moving, fussing or crying seems to set it off about 99% of the time, which is pretty much perfect.* Video quality is excellent! And the night vision works great (I was skeptical it would work well, but honestly it's pretty awesome!). Initially positioning the camera takes some trial and error, but once set up it's fine. Just don't bump that camera once it's set up!* The monitor unit itself can be mounted to a wall or just sat on its own little stand. And when mounted on the wall there is still decent (but not excellent) directional flexibility.* Instructions/manual were okay. A bit on the light side, but well written and easy to follow.* Quality and reliability both seem okay. The monitor feels a bit \"cheap and pasticy\" but not too bad. Our monitor and camera worked right out the box with no problems. But I don't doubt some other buyers ran into problems. But I think that's the same with any product - there are always the occasional duds.CONS:* Battery life on the monitor is pretty terrible. But you can run it while the charger is plugged in. So as long as you have a power socket near by it's not a real problem.* The audio sensor is a bit unreliable. If our son hasn't made a noise in a long time the monitor kicks on 100%, so that's good. But then after about 10 seconds it switches off, and doesn't come on again for another 45 seconds or so, even if he makes noise in the meantime. But overall this isn't a big problem, but a minor annoyance.* Despite what it says, this device doesn't play nicely with some wifi devices. The wifi connection on my smart phone often (but not always) dies as soon as both the baby monitor and camera are switched on - even when just downloading very small data footprints like small text/HTML pages. And my Roku 2 box consistently loses its connection within about 20 seconds of both the monitor and camera being on and connected. I tried changing the channel for my wireless router (as recommended by the manufacturer) and it didn't help at all. They say in the manual that there are known problems with the unit sharing a wifi connection, but they wrongly blame the wireless router, saying some nonsense like \"it's being too greedy\". Simple fact is, when I run into connectivity problems it is NEVER with the Infant Optics monitor or camera. It is always with other devices. So it's fair to say the Infant Optics units are the ones being greedy. The wifi hogging is annoying, but we really just use it at night, so it's manageable. But the lame customer service responses were frustrating. Oh, and the wifi hogging is only a problem when BOTH the camera and monitor are on and connected (this should be pretty obvious, but I thought I'd clarify just in case).* The kick-stand for the monitor unit doesn't lock open. So any little nudge to it and the kick-stand will close, sending the monitor falling backwards. Again, not a show-stopper, but an annoyance.* It would be nice to have a setting where you could turn off the audio sensor so you always hear audio via the camera. But that's not a huge deal.Overall I would definitely recommend this product. But just know its limitations and take those into account when deciding on a purchase. Most of the \"cons\" above really weren't a big deal for us, although the wifi hogging can be an inconvenience.

We got it nearly a year ago and have been using it regularly for the past 10 months or so. It works great and IO has great customer service. Did lots of research on video baby monitors before asking for this one because of the high price tag and many poor reviews I'd seen on Summer Infant monitors breaking just after the replacement period, all with the same problem, and SI seemed to be unhelpful.PROS- Image quality is great.- Clear night vision image.- Voice-activated feature and auto-mute were a must for us. These features work great, though we have encountered a few quirks, explained below.- There is a stand for the camera, and it is wall-mountable.- EXCELLENT customer service, super-responsive. This is truly the selling point that makes me wholeheartedly recommend this with 5 stars, and strongly recommend to all my friends. If you are going to drop a lot of money on a video monitor, at least make sure the company will do something about delivering a product that will perform. I read so many reviews about terrible customer service responses to apparently wide-spread experiences.CONS:- This isn't a $300 model with room temperature sensor, talk-back feature, remote camera adjustment, etc. As far as we were concerned, we didn't need those bells and whistles, we just wanted to see what the baby was doing if he was crying (did we need to go in to help him back to sleep or not, was he safe) so I didn't want to have to pay for all those features anyway. If you need them you are probably looking at a Motorola purchase. Summer Infant seems to break down too often.- red ring of lights around the camera for night vision, but I don't know how you get around this for night vision feature.- cant use vox with wave sound mahine but works fine with static white noise- It interferes with our wifi signal sometimes. Not all the time, but sometimes. So if we know we need to do something on the internet after the baby goes to sleep, we just don't turn on the camera until after we are finished with it. I have found that it is generally fine when we don't have the receiver turned on.- we have experienced some quirks with the voice-activated function (VOX). sometimes when we turn on the receiver, it automatically goes into VOX mode where it is essentially sleeping until it detects noise or movement. I have found that most times when this happens it doesn't properly activate when the baby starts crying. I would hear the baby crying on the other side of the house and the receiver is still in VOX mode. This is obviously a problem, and unfortunately, sometimes it isn't a problem and works fine even if it flashes \"VOX entering stand-by mode\" when turned on. However, so as to avoid the problem, every time it flashes this when turned on, I still adjust the volume or brightness to engage the camera image, then let it drop into VOX standby mode. If I do this, I don't experience the aforementioned problem.A note on our customer service experience and possible troubleshooting if you experience some similar problems:- charger stopped working 6mo in: easy peasy. Emailed Infant Optics and they immediately sent me a new charger. I live in NC and it took 2 days to arrive from CA. Could not have imagined better service.- VOX/Auto mute issues 6mo+ into use: For some reason, VOX and Auto mute stopped working sometimes. And sometimes the standby feature would engage but not reactivate. I encountered this problem right after getting the replacement charger cord mentioned above. It was so bizarre. We stopped turning on the receiver if it didn't go to VOX or auto mute because my husband couldn't stand the noise it made, then we contacted infant optics who offered to send us a replacement if we shipped it back. They even offered to ship out the replacement as soon as we sent shipping confirmation that our faulty unit was in the mail! BEFORE they would even have received our faulty unit! I was impressed with their going out of their way to ensure we had a properly functioning unit. However, the camera still worked, so we actually found that it was more useful to have camera access for the two days it would take to receive a replacement, because we just left the camera on and if I heard him crying down the hall, I could still \"look in\" on him by turning on the camera momentarily. Anyway, I kept going back and forth about taking IO up on the offer to replace the unit, then I'd try turning on the receiver again and sometimes it would work. It was really bizarre.  I'm still not sure exactly what was going on there, but it seems to be working fine now. VOX works again and so does Auto mute. Here are a couple of my guesses as to what may have caused the quirks with VOX and Auto mute being testy (except if the receiver automatically goes to standby when turned on... we still sometimes have problems with it activating when noise is made, as mentioned above):*we have an air filter in the room. The placement of camera and air filter may have played into it. I noticed when I didn't turn the camera so far over (toward the air filter) we didn't have the problem. we also played around with the placement of the air filter in the room for several days. perhaps the blowing air was picked up by the microphone sensor. not sure on this, but if you have the same problem, I would try to play around with it if you have an air filter.*maybe our outlet was struck by lightning which caused the charger cord to stop working (not sure, but there were storms around that time and only the monitor was plugged into that outlet) which may have affected the receiver, but I don't know much about electronics. if it was affected, then after a few days rest, could it have bounced back like that?", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Monitor", "Author": "M.

People have commented on the \"cheapness\" of the feeling of the plastic in the monitor. I do agree with this, although the quality of the image more than makes up for it. I mainly watch the baby at night and the \"night vision\" clarity on the screen is so superb, we actually rely on it when putting baby to sleep *while we're in his room* to make sure his eyes are closed and he's not moving. I like the range of motion on the camera; we have it sitting on the corner of the crib right now and will be moving it to atop his dresser soon. The camera covers quite a bit of the width and depth of the crib. I also like that it takes a charge very well and the charging cord is long. I leave it plugged it overnight with the monitor next to my pillow.Two things I don't love: The red lights surrounding the lens and the green light emitting from the camera attract baby's attention when he awakes in the dark. He will look right into the lens which creates the \"light in the eyes\" effect that you sometimes get when you take a picture of your dog. It distracts him somewhat from trying to go back to sleep. Also, it somewhat interferes with the WiFi signal in my house. When the monitor is on (not the camera; we leave it on all the time) my phone and computer take a while to load web pages.Still, this is an amazing camera for the money.

I give this monitor a lot of points for how durable it is. My toddler was obsessed with the monitor and it took quite a beating. I assumed that the charging issue was the result of heavy abuse and after it stopped charging entirely, purchased a new unit. When the new unit came. I plugged in the old monitor to the new charger and it worked like new. I kept the new unit anyway since the old one had been damaged and even purchasing two at $100, I hadn't spent what I would on one of the other monitor systems plus I could use a second camera now and we plan to have another child. After 5 uses, the new monitor stopped charging. I didn't let my son near the monitor, so I know it hasn't been damaged, but it will not charge at all. This has lead me to conclude it's the charger that is defective and not the monitor unit. I'm ordering a replacement unit now and will give it another shot and will update with my experience.As for the quality of the monitor, it's basic video and sound. I never found myself wanting more from it or extra features. The on/off feature where the monitor turns off unless there is sound didn't work for us because we use white noise machines when my son sleeps, so they always triggered the noise level and the monitor never turned off, not a big deal. The picture quality was good, night vision works well and sound is good an can go quite loud. The first unit we had interfered more with our wifi than the second unit, but we found that the situation improved when we changed the channel on our router.I still recommend this monitor.

Now, after the third monitor broke, the same way, I'm done. The major problem with these, and the reason you should look elsewhere for baby monitors, is the plastic antenna on top. With a simple drop or bump, it breaks. And if you have small kids, trust me, you or someone else in the family will drop or bump the monitor and the plastic piece that protects the antenna wire below will snap off. Why not super glue it back on, you ask? I tried that. All three times. But inevitably that breaks and what ultimately happens is the wire gets twisted or crumpled, which leads to so much static that it's unusable. These things are so cheaply made (both camera and monitor are super lightweight pieces of plastic) that it doesn't take much to damage them. They are also extremely basic in terms of functions. It's incredible they're asking close to a hundred dollars for something this cheaply made. We had the previous version of the Summer Infant video cam and monitor and it worked great.

We are very happy with our purchase and for the price, you get a very practical and useful baby monitor.  A couple features my husband and I find particularly useful are the auto mute so that you don't hear every little sound the baby makes, and the VOX standby mode.  Another perk to purchasing this product is the exceptional customer service you receive with this company.  Our monitor got wet and I wanted to purchase a new screen, so when I contacted customer service, they offered to replace the unit at no charge because we had purchased it within the year.  All we had to do to receive our new monitor was send it back and scan and email the shipping receipt.  The new monitor arrived promptly and the customer service representative was in constant contact with me via email until she was sure I had received the product and I was happy with it.I gave the product four out of five stars for two (relatively minor) reasons: first, even with the VOX standby mode enabled, the monitor has to be plugged in or the power does not last throughout the night.  Second, the inner part of one side of the screen on our first monitor sank in after a few months of use.

We live in an apartment building in a densely populated city, so we needed a secure video monitor that wouldn't have interference problems - this does the trick.  Occasionally we experience interference with our wifi network, but only if the monitor unit is turned on and held less than 2 ft away from a wifi device (such as a smartphone or laptop) - this will cause the wifi on the smartphone or laptop to slow down, but it won't cause any problems for the monitor/camera nor does it completely cut off our wifi.  The only feature I occasionally wish the monitor had was the ability to talk to the child through the monitor (ie talk to the camera via the monitor).  I don't use most of the other features such as auto-mute, so I can't speak to their utility.  We recently ordered an additional add-on camera from Amazon Infant Optics Add-On Camera for DXR-5 2.4 Ghz Video Monitor (DXR-871) before our second child was born and the camera that we received didn't work very well - the image was out of focus no matter how we adjusted it.  I contacted the customer service at Infant Optics via their website and they shipped me a new camera right away, no questions asked.  They then emailed me a week later to ask if the camera was working or if they could further assist us.  The new camera works perfectly and I was most pleased with their customer service.  Now that I have the monitor linked to two cameras, I can say that it may not be a good choice  if you plan to link it to more than one camera because it doesn't automatically alternate between the camera views - you have to press the pairing button to switch views.  This means that you can't just go to sleep with the monitor on and rely on it to transmit audio/video from both cameras - it will only do so from one camera until you actively switch it to another.  This is fine for my purposes because I only rely on it for video - our home is small enough that I can hear both my kids from anywhere, so we sleep with the monitor off and only turn it on to see what's going on in if we hear crying.  So from my perspective, I have zero regrets about buying this monitor and the add-on camera.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Its okay.

I very much like that the sound will turn off if she is silent.I am giving this a 4 star because I wish we could turn the SCREEN off at night and keep the sound on low. That screen is still so so bright when we sleep, even after we turn it down as low as it will go. I have to put a towel over it to cover the light up.Warning. if the battery starts to die on you it will make an incredibly LOUD beep noise and if you are around the sleeping baby it will surely wake that kid up.

Miller", "ReviewID": "R3K6APGASAOE8Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Like many others who reviewed this monitor, I had a summer infant monitor.  I was going to get a second camera for that monitor, but the reviews on it were bad and just a camera cost as much as this whole system.  So I got this as a second so we'd have a back up if our old one (2 years old) died.As previous reviewers commented, it is not the most sturdy plastic.  But that isn't a big deal.  It also has a clear picture compared to our old one, which I like.  However, it does interfere with our wifi, which is older, so I can't check email on my phone when it is near-by.There are a few features our old one has that I really miss:1. the volume lights: the old one has lights (green through red) to show the volume in the room.  this is really nice when your spouse is sleeping but you want to keep an eye on the baby crying since you don't always want to run in there.2. turning off the image: with our old one, you can turn the image off or on but the sound stays on.  This saves the battery life and also the light can be very bright in a dark bedroom but you'll wake up if they cry and need you.  Then you can turn the picture on to check on them.  The infant optics one instead has something called \"VOX\".  with the vox feature turned on, the monitor goes into a \"sleep\" mode when there is no sound in the room for a certain period of time. It then \"wakes up\" when there is sound above a certain level. However, this is why I'm giving it a 1 star.  If you don't have it plugged in to the wall and it is in vox mode, then it won't just go to sleep, it will turn itself off completely (battery dies???) without ANY warning.  So, you think the monitor is on, but it isn't and then you don't hear the kid crying (and crying and crying).  BAD!  This thing should beep like crazy if the battery is dying (again, assuming this is the cause) but instead you just think it's asleep.  We haven't had this problem if the monitor is plugged in. If it wasn't for this, I think this would be a darn good monitor for the money but because of this, I wish I'd looked at other options.

Also, when it is not plugged in, when it runs out of battery life it does not beep to let you know, it just silently shuts off -- so unless you are constantly visually checking the monitor you have no idea it has just turned itself off.

We use the Marpac white noise machine (love it) for our daughter, and it's apparently loud enough (from the other side of a 12' room) that the monitor never goes into standby mode.

It works, and works well.  It is easy to set up, is in color during the day and has night vision for night.  It's not exactly HD but who cares. It's easy enough for us to see if our little one is standing or lying, the difference between if she will fall back asleep or if we need to go comfort her.  It is also very durable as it has been dropped and dragged around and keeps on ticking. As a negative it does affect our wireless speed, but if we really need the speed then we just turn the monitor off until we go to bed and everything is fine.  Overall, 5/5Nor for the customer service review.  We bought this in July, 2012.  Last week the monitor quit charging so I checked and it has a 1 year warranty.  I emailed them about the problem and they quickly responded with some helpful tips to determine if it was the monitor or the charger.  After it was determined it was the charger, I informed them via email again.  They again responded very quickly (within 30 minutes) and sent me a new one with simply the order info from Amazon and no fuss or need to send back the old one.

The camera part is not wireless, so you do have to mount it somewhere where the cord is safely away from baby. The cord is black, which isn't attractive running across the wall of the nursery.

I can appreciate the value of it - you DO see and hear your baby. The range seems good - my son was in our living room and we were out in our driveway and it worked just fine. My main issues are the grainy picture and the automatic night vision adjustments. My camera, unless it is super bright in the room (or we're outside but who puts their baby to bed outside), thinks it's night time and I get a black and white grainy picture of him with scary night vision eyes. Lol. Like I said, I CAN see him so that's nice but I was expecting the clarity in the pictures in the description and in neither day nor night mode do I get anything close! The sound is also a bit fuzzy - the monitor emits (or the camera picks up) a static like white noise. I could hear him fussing/crying but when he's silent the monitor is not.For those skimming reviews:1) Camera thinks it's night time unless the room is very bright so you get IR image a lot of the time2) Day and night images are grainy at best, nothing like the advertisement pics3) Static noise comes out of monitor even when room is silent4) NO ZOOM so to get a close up of your baby's face like in the advertisement image your camera would have to be IN the crib with him!I think I will be returning this one. While it's a steal at $100 (the amazon sale price) that's still 100 bucks that could perhaps be put toward a better monitor for maybe just a little bit more money.Hope this helps!UPDATE 07/09/13 -- From 3 stars to 2! I held on to the monitor thinking it was working well enough for my needs and not wanting to spend more money. Bad idea! Turns out on a full charge, I can watch my son with the monitor only for up to two naps (about 2 hours total) before I have to charge it again! It just doesn't hold a charge and it's a real pain in the butt!Also, I have realized the importance of the zoom feature that the higher quality monitors have. The company's image in their ad showing the baby's face isnt attainable unless your camera is right next to the crib, in the perfect spot (there's no pan/tilt either) which is tough with a short power cord. I don't know about you, but I'm trying to keep cords and electronics AWAY from his crib.

Small and fairly inconspicuous.  Decent battery life.Cons:  Very cheaply constructed.  I've had to superglue parts (particularly the antenna) back on several times.  The screen cover pops off at the slightest bump.  The first time I ordered this monitor, the antenna and screen cover came off, so I returned it, thinking it was defective or damaged.  When the new one arrived, the antenna snapped off AGAIN, so apparently that's just the way it is.There aren't any lights on the monitor to indicate when your children are making noise.  So the only way to know if they're making noise is to keep the volume on.  But even the lowest volume setting is too loud.  I find myself constantly turning the volume off, then back on a few minutes later to see if my child has fallen asleep.  Once my child is asleep, I need to remember to have the volume turned on, otherwise I won't know when she wakes up.There isn't a warning beep when the batteries get low.  The monitor just goes dead.  Several times I've realized that I can hear one of my children crying upstairs, and glance at the monitor, only to see that it's turned itself off.

For the price it is legit and does what it needs to. We could have purchased a $200-$300 monitor, but we live in a small house and can hear our baby even without the monitor (once she gets really worked up)and we aren't made of cash (thus we shop on Amazon). The monitor is great for peace of mind and does everything we would want. We have the same complaints as many people 1) The monitor interferes with our wireless internet router (supposedly we can update the firmware on our modem) 2) The fan in the room with the baby (creating white noise) keeps the monitor from going into hibernate and thus keeps the monitor on all night (I just cover it up with a sock :)) 3) The clip is not super strong etc.However with all the \"downsides\" mentioned above the monitor is GREAT and I would definitely recommend to friends on a budget. If you are rolling in the dough and are upset that you \"wasted\" $100 bucks on a monitor that was not up to your standard then go ahead and spend double, but quit complaining and leaving poor reviews for buying a budget monitor and expecting a deluxe machine. I read reviews about the battery life being terrible and that it won't last through the night, but I have not had a problem with the monitor lasting through the night due to the monitor actually coming with an AC PLUG!!! Sadly my nights are pretty unadventurous and I usually do not find myself wandering from room to room at night so plugging in my monitor when I got to bed seems pretty uhhhh easy. The battery life throughout the day is usually perfect. It almost always makes it through the day during her naps. Oh did I mention I turn the monitor off when I am not using it and just leave the cameras plugged in... another great battery saving technique.One thing I was a little bummed about was that after much much use/abuse over a 7 month span our receiving unit started acting finicky so we contacted Infant Optics about a replacement. They ask you to just pack up the monitor and ship it back (seven buckeroos at the post office). Upon providing proof of shipping (a picture of the box with their address on it) they ship a monitor to you. They say it takes 2-3 days for the replacement to arrive, but just know that it takes more like a week to get to you. Maybe if your monitor is finicky just send in a picture of the monitor, wait a few days, and then drop it off at the post office to minimize time without a partially working unit. All in all their customer service was AMAZING. They handled our return with much professionalism and we have a brand new working monitor set up in her room again.I would buy this unit again (even though it was a gift from our registry).

The instructions clearly state not to place the camera cord anywhere within 3 feet of the baby's bed.  Well when the camera HAS to be plugged into the wall, this is not the easiest task.  Most wall plugs are found near ground level, not ceiling level.  This is my main complaint about this camera.  I like that you can completely turn off the sound, but on our next camera I plan to find a bit bigger screen and one that has the communication feature.  I have found that if I sit in the hallway and speak loudly my twins listen to me since I know when they're out of bed, so being able to not \"yell\" for them to hear me will be nice.Another slight con is the screen size.  I have to pick up the monitor and get a close look to actually see what's going on in the room (and i'm not old!).I have not heard any beeping noise that others mention, but I did notice that the battery on the parent unit doesn't last very long and there's no \"low battery\" warning.

It was easy to set up and gives a clear picture. I have had no signal problems in our smallish house, and it worked even in our backyard. The power-saving mode (where the video turns off if there is no noise for a few minutes) is nice because the light from the screen doesn't keep me up if the baby is just sleeping, but it turns on if he wakes up and I can push a button to check on him any time as well. I read a review that said there was a beep when the monitor went into power-saving mode, but mine doesn't beep. The video just turns off after a few minutes of quiet.My only issue is that the battery (even fully charged) does not last all night (9 pm to 6 am), even in the power-saving mode. We don't have an outlet near enough to our bed to have the monitor plugged in and in view all night. And if you are asleep, you can't see the light that is supposed to flash when the battery gets low. But this is a minor complaint since I can still hear when baby wakes up if the monitor is plugged in across the room. You just have to know that it needs to be plugged in after several hours.I purchased it in an open box from the Amazon Warehouse, so it was a great price and I am pleased with the quality as well.UPDATE Nov. 2013: I am still happy with this monitor overall, but I have noticed the power-saving (VOX) mode is kind of inconsistent. Sometimes the noise of a car driving by the other side of the house turns it back on, but my child crying does not. So I would advise NOT using the VOX mode if you are not within earshot of your child. Your child's cries may not wake the monitor up from power-saving mode.UPDATE April 2014: The charger for the parent unit has failed, the insulation on the cord separated and exposed the copper right where it meets the end you plug into the wall. I am not sure exactly when it happened. In the last couple of weeks, I had trouble getting it to charge, but I rarely unplug the charger from the wall, so I didn't notice until yesterday that there was damage to the cord. I emailed Infant Optics, and even though I was a week past the 1 year warranty period, they are replacing the power cord for free. So while I am disappointed that the cord only lasted a year, I am very impressed with their customer service.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "battery is dead after 2 month of use...", "Author": "Qiaolin Huang", "ReviewID": "R3J3QLCHKO6DHC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "battery is dead after 2 month of use...now it is not portable.

Infant optics works OK, but there are just too many little things that make it pretty annoying.- the most important of all is that the sound quality is barely ok. I have clearly seem my baby babble through the video, yet the auto mute remained on. Last night I heard her coughing through the door about 5 seconds before the monitor woke up and the sound turned on. I know 5 seconds isn't much, but it is a mild annoyance. I guess more importantly, with our old SI we could hear the baby breathing if listening hard enough. No way is that happening with the IO- the alarm noise. Wrong channel and some other inexplicable things cause the monitor to emit a loud alarm like noise. This is by no means necessary, the message on the screen is plenty to realize you're on the wrong channel. And very disruptive when it goes off at night for no reason- endless toggling of buttons. To do anything... Change channel, volume, brightness, mute, sleep mode, infrared.. You must press one or combination of several buttons. These are also not super quiet. Toggling through these, especially when your significant other is still asleep in the quiet of the night is like nails on a chalkboard. The fact that the monitor doesn't always respond on the first try just adds to the problem. Our old SI had scroll wheels for these purposes that was much easier to deal with- Cord for camera is too short. If you're trying to hang this on the wall, say 7 feet off the floor and your outlets are about a foot off the floor the power cord for the camera unit is too short.I'm sure I'm forgetting many other things that are making me regrets buying this monitor, but above is plenty.All in all, does the monitor work for it's intended purpose?

It doesn't have any bells and whistles, just a video and sound monitor.  In VOX mode, the screen will turn off after a few minutes of no/low, background sound, which saves battery life and doesn't light up your bedroom at night!  Additionally, it will auto mute after about 30 sec of background sound.  The picture quality is great and the infrared lights give a nice, clear picture.  I used mine at a friends house in which the guest room was downstairs and we hung out upstairs on the other side of their average sized house and there was no interference.Overall, I am obviously very happy with this monitor.

My husband and I have frequently stated, \"I wish we had spend that extra $125 to get a decent monitor!\"Pros:-You can see your baby, and it is a totally decent view. Never had a problem.-It does have the auto voice and screen turn on, but this turns out to be a con for most people.-Works totally well. No glitching, blackness, etc.If you are on a SUPER tight budget, I would say you should get this for the video monitor. Keep in mind that you will probably have to modify in order to not be driven INSANE! We currently have cotton balls and tape over the speaker, and keep a sock over the screen for the light.Cons:-The volume control is TERRIBLE!! The lowest volume you can put it on is way too loud! I can hear my fridge humming, birds chirping outside, etc. on the lowest volume. Hence the cotton balls muffling the speakers.-There is no way to have the screen off and audio on. That's right. All night long you get to have the screen lighting up your room. Unless you turn it onto the VOX auto shut off setting, but that becomes a problem addressed below. This is why we keep a sock over the screen.-There is a way to keep the screen on, and the audio off unless a noise is made over a certain decibel. There will be silence, then lets say the heater turns on, or your baby makes a coo in their sleep, the audio turns on and due to the loud volume, you hear loud static for however many seconds until it turns back off. This happens day and night, and can sometimes disrupt your sleep with it turning on and off making the auto function almost useless. I'd rather just have the constant static as to not be disrupted.-There is also a setting that mutes the audio and shuts off the screen until sound is made. This would work too, if you couldn't HEAR the screen powering on and off. Kind of like the sound some tv's would make powering up. This woke me up CONSTANTLY. Especially with the screen turning on and off at any little noise.-It interferes with my wifi on the ipad. I can't watch netflix in bed (where we keep the monitor) without it constantly freezing up or not loading. Once I turn monitor off, then netflix plays.-It will randomly beep and say \"out of signal coverage!!!\" Your monitor wont work, and will continue to beep until you turn it off and on again. This happens at 4am sometimes, when the monitor hasn't been moved all night! Totally random.-Battery life is bad off the charger. It can last a few hours and that's it.As I have said, if you are on a budget, this will work. But you will find yourself annoyed by it constantly.

Good audio: Good enough to actually hear the sounds the baby is making AND be able turn up the volume on the receiver to a fairly high level without ridiculous amounts of background noise. (As I said above, the DXR-5 audio does not work.  Only 1 out of every 10 sounds is picked up and the volume on the reciever is so low you can't even hear those unless you are 2 feet from the receiver.)2.  Basic video: Video's sole purpose is to help you decide if you need to go into the baby's room or not. You might think you are going to use it for more than that but you aren't. You need to be able to see the whole crib, and be able to tell what is actually happening in it - that's it. (The DXR-5 meets this criteria.)3. Easy set up:  I should be able to put the monitor on a shelf, mount it to a wall and easily be able to point it at the crib. (The DXR-5 fails here as well.  The only way to set up the camera is to mount it to a vertical wall.  Because of the way it is made you can not set it on a shelf and point it down at a crib. Not possible.)The Infant Optics DXR-5 is not worth buying.", "Date": "April 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Save yourself!", "Author": "Gillybird", "ReviewID": "RN7IF0TR4NVSS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As I said in the topic, save yourself. I rated it 1 star because it was difficult to use. I bought this baby monitor for my 5 month old daughter because my first one broke and saw that this one was a really good price!  When I got it I saw that you had to move the camera back and forth manually. It also could not go up and down at all.When you try to set the camera up it is hard because the bottom is rounded and will slip very easily! Once I was just done trying to keep it balanced and had to tape it to my crib to keep it in place. I don't really understand why people say that the pictures on the monitor are great because on the one I had it would keep still every know and then. It would also make the baby white because it thought it was bright when it was really dark!  It had a really cheap feeling to it too. It is a big waste of money and if you just listen it will keep you the trouble. Trust me I had it for 2 months and it didn't work for me. You can try but it will not work!

With all the strong reviews, I thought this would be it but it has caused more headaches than my Summer Infant monitor every did.Pro: Nice large screen; adjustable camera angles when mountedCons:1) Interference issues with wi-fi - we had to buy a newer router that used another frequency just to decrease the interference enough for the signal to \"hold\". Our house is less than 1200 sq ft on the main floor and the signal was not strong enough to transmit across the distance of the house. It would frequently flash \"out of range\" but the worst part is that the monitor spontaneously shut off not once but THREE times because of persistant out of range warnings.2) Volume shutting off - yes, this has an auto-mute feature that is nice. But sometimes if the monitor and camera don't sync just right, the volume defaults to mute and will not activate when the baby cries. This has happened a few times and causing my 2 month old infant to \"cry it out\" unintentionally.3) As mentioned in a few reviews, the product feels cheap in hand. To be fair, it is half the cost of other video monitors but I'm not sure if it would survive a hard toss onto the hardwood floor by my toddler.I am on the fence about returning it but if I had to do it over, I would have spent the extra money on the SI monitor to avoid all the signal and volume challenges we had especially when our child is still so young.", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Broke after a week", "Author": "Dustin Bruening", "ReviewID": "R1J1YMSTJ3TM6B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It's on its way back in the box to head back to Amazon.

I wrote the company and I will be buying a different monitor- this one is junk!This is my second video monitor (my first was a summer infant color monitor that is no longer produced).  I have had it for over 3 months now.Pros:Easy to assembleLightweightMultiple Cameras possibleNight vision is clearEasy to use- not a lot of buttons or settingsCons:No way to tilt camera up or down (not useful if the camera is up high- who wants to see an image of a wall?- I ended up putting a towel under that back half, but I am constantly having to readjust as it slips)The loudest volume setting- not loud at all.  I can't hear my baby screaming when the monitor is on the loudest setting if I have some sort of noise in the room I am in (water running etc)- not helpful because I use naptime to clean.My biggest beef with this camera?  It shuts off constantly.  I get that it is a power and sanity saving feature for parents- but I dont like that it turns itself off.  Yes, I know it turns back on when it detects noise, however on more than one occasion I have noticed that it shuts off WHILE my baby is crying (not whimpering).  If I don't catch the crying in the monitor immediately- I may not know that my child is crying.  It is a little unnerving- the Summer infant models had a visual cue (color bar to show how loud the noise in the nursery was) and louder volume.If I had the opportunity, knowing what I know now- I probably wouldn't buy this one again.  Yes, other monitors are VERY expensive.  However, my first monitor was on 16 hours a day for almost 3 years and worked very well- it was worth the money.  I am disappointed in this model.

At the time, this monitor was great.  Yes, WAS.  After about 6 months, we noticed that the battery life had dramatically shortened.  After about another month, 9 months in, the monitor stopped working unless it was plugged in.  As soon as you unplugged it, it wouldn't work.  And finally, 2 weeks ago, it completely stopped working all together.  So I now have a cheap piece of plastic that is good for using as a hockey puck, and that's about it.Now, let me say this...the monitor itself was pretty good when it worked.  No static, very sensitive to sound, and of course, night vision, however, it did come with some kinks.  The whole, auto-off unless there is a noise really sucks.  You can't have a sound machine on or you can just forget the whole auto-off feature.  Also, it doesn't really work anyway, when there is no sound machine.  Many times, it would randomly come on even when our little peanut was dead silent.  Also, when keeping it on, sometimes in the middle of the night, it would randomly beep really loudly and say out of range.

It was acting up recently so we decided to give video a try. We were deciding between this and the Levana Jena monitor but went with the DXR because of its longer track record and poor reviews of earlier Levana monitors.As a monitor this is pretty terrible. Our basic requirement is that we hear the baby crying when the monitor is 6 feet away while we are watching TV. This is way too quiet for that, even on its loudest setting. The other huge problem is that it seems to turn itself completely off (not just a \"sleep\" mode) with no warning or predictability.It's slightly better as a video camera to keep watch the baby during nap time. I can only comment on the night vision mode since our child naps in a dark room. To actually get a color picture you basically need direct sunlight beaming into the room. In our experience even with the ceiling light on in the room it is pretty grayscale. As others have mentioned the \"infrared\" lights that circle the camera are visible to the naked eye but fortunately it doesn't bother our baby. The bigger issue is the green power light on top of the unit which basically lights up the whole room (we put black electrical tape over ours).I don't know how anyone could give this high marks for video quality. To call it pixelly would be putting things mildly. You can basically tell what's going on but it's almost like an impressionist painting. The viewing angle is extremely limited; you almost have to look at it dead on. Glare is also a big issue. It's OK at night in a room with incandescent lights but right now I'm experiencing significant glare just with natural light on a cloudy day. I suspect it would be completely unusable outside.We also don't like the limited options for mounting the camera. I'm not sure what other models use but I wish there was some kind of clip option. This would be fine if you have a decent ledge where you want to mount it or are willing to drill holes in your wall, but we were stuck taping it in place.Having said all of this, we decided it wasn't worth returning. Our old Sony is working again as a monitor but this is mildly amusing to watch the baby move around in the crib.  It has also proved useful in that our baby doesn't reliably cry or make noise when he wakes up. Being able to see him moving on the monitor has saved us from waiting until he makes noise to go in and get him.", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great, if you only care about the picture and don't need sound.", "Author": "Erin N.

A couple of times I've woken up at 5am to a screaming infant with no idea how long he'd been crying (luckily both times have been since he has started sleeping until 4-5 consistently).  That is a terrible feeling for a mother.  I know, I know - \"How hard is it to remember to plug it in?\"  I'm a first-time new mom.  I'm tired.  I shouldn't have to worry about this.  Oh and one more minor thing that I'm able to overlook but someone else might not be - the VOX feature doesn't work if you have a white noise machine in baby's room.  This may contribute to the crappy battery life in our house, because the monitor is on all night and never guess into battery-saving mode.

But I don't like that I can't just wake at night and glance at my baby and see/hear him breathing, moving, or whatever. It is voice activated and there's a slight delay before it kicks on. So if he wakes up happy and just plays in his crib, I don't get to see that like I did with our old monitor (that fell and broke). I would have to know he was quietly playing and click it on. It does click on a split second after he cries or makes noise, but you don't always know what kicked it on. A cough is often too short to hear the cough, you just see the monitor went on. And then it beeps when it goes back off. So if the baby is going back to sleep in the middle of the night and you are falling asleep quickly with the quiet, you get woken up a couple minutes later with a beep when it turns back off. There's supposed to be a way to override that and make it stay on, but that feature doesn't work on my monitor.I like how small the monitor is so I can easily carry it around. I love that the battery recharges when it is plugged in. I like that the picture is in color during the day. I LOVE how clear the picture is and the sound. There is no loud buzzing to put up with just to hear when there's a cry.When we first bought this monitor we had no problems with it. I could take it everywhere in the house and it worked. Then we moved. For some reason, this house has lots of interference. It's not the monitor's fault. It's the house. We have the same problem with wireless internet. However, because of this problem, there are many places in the house where the monitor doesn't work.Also, if the electricity flashes off for a moment, the camera in the child's room shuts off. Then you get nothing until you turn it back on. My son sleeps lightly so I do NOT go in there. I keep an old audio monitor on all the time so I can switch to that when I need to. That old thing buzzes loudly and makes me unhappy that my video monitor turned off.So overall I think it's great.

After some initial problems, we got it working ok.  But now, after using it for just a short while, it is starting to have multiple problems.  Since it is supposed to have a one year warranty, I contacted the company and their solution is that we pay to ship back the item to them and they claim that once they receive it, they will give me a credit on Amazon to re-purchase the item.  Having recently watched some friends of friends lose a baby to SIDS, being without a monitor is not an option.  Additionally, since the problems with the monitor are at no fault of my own, I am not inclined to waste my very little free time to package this up, mail it, be without it, all at my own expense (on the company's promise that they'll give me a credit on Amazon once they receive it back).  This is very, very poor customer service.  They should ship me a new monitor plus a mailing label to return the faulty item.PROS: 1) it is not expensive compared to other video monitors; 2) the video feature (including the night-vision), works fairly well; and 3) compared to our audio monitor that we discarded due to terrible sound interference, this monitor is fairly quiet and doesn't seem to get much interference.CONS: 1) the VOX feature (video-activation), stopped working; 2) the auto-mute function stopped working; 3) the battery life is TERRIBLE and does not last through the night (one great feature of our audio monitor), so the monitor has to be plugged in all night; 4) the monitor makes no noise when the battery dies so you can be unaware that the battery died and the monitor has turned off; 5) you cannot purchase an extra monitor in order to keep one upstairs and one downstairs if you live in a two-story house; 6) the camera has several lights on it so it can be bright and distracting for some babies.Basically, this is a one star item that gets a one star boost due to its price.

We have a Summer video monitor for our 1st child and decided to save some money for our second child. This was a waste of $100. It's virtually impossible to hear anything unless the child is making noise - if it's on the \"Vox\" setting, meaning it goes into a hibernation mode after 5 minutes, it shuts down unless it picks up a noise of 65decibals or more. What we were looking for is something where we can hear our baby and periodically peek in on them. This device serves more as an alarm, if your child makes a loud noise then the system turns on and you can hear and see them. Kind of defeats the purpose of a video monitor.If you turn it off the Vox mode, the screen is lit up and does not turn off. In that setting I still can't hear anything, even if my wife goes into the room and whispers. The lit up screen stinks if you're trying to sleep. I've got flashlights that aren't as bright.I wasn't expecting anything huge with this purchase, as I was shopping on price. I've got to think spending the extra 75 bucks is worth it.

The monitor is  TINY  5.  The cord from the camera is so short.  My other one reaches clear up to the ceiling and still has room to pull it along the ceiling and then down to a plug.  The warnings on this product say that you should keep it out of reach from your child but you would have to use an extension cord to do this.  I have mine about 3/4 up the wall with a plug directly below it.  It doesn't even show me the whole crib.  5.

However, very few people mentioned audio quality, and that is what makes this product a terrible purchase!  I just received this product today, and I am already returning it.  The audio quality is worse than that of a pair of $30 kid's walkie-talkies.  All sounds are distorted and tinny, including crying, speaking, and even music.  The metallic quality is very high pitched and reminds me of nails on a chalkboard.  The audio also has a ton of white noise and static.  Video quality is about that of a web cam, but was decent enough for the price.  It does not have a zoom feature and the quality is not high enough to display small details, especially on night vision. However, audio monitors have been around for a couple decades now; this technology is not new.  To include such a poor quality speaker and/or microphone must be where this company makes up for the price of the video technology included.Overall,Pros:-Affordable price-Easy to set-up, took 5 minutesCons:-Terrible sound quality-Low video qualities - definitely will not be able to see small details with the night vision, like did your kid just hiccup or throw up all over themselves?I would definitely not recommend this product.***UPDATE***I did contact Infant Optics about the terrible speaker.  My email was returned with 24 hours, which was very nice.  They offered to replace the set for me, at no cost, which was also very nice.  However, if the new set had the same audio problems, I still wanted to be able to return it to Amazon.  I couldn't guarantee they would send me the same packaging, styling, etc. as what Amazon sells.  So I just returned it to Amazon, rather than risk it.  I still think their product is not up to the five star rating, but I will give customer service 5 stars though.

So for almost two weeks you are stuck without the unit and not able to use it!  This has happened three times now.  I thought I was being smart and actually purchased a back up power supply for the next time.  Well the next time happened last night, so I plugged in my back up supply and it doesn't work.

I always thought that video monitors were ridiculously expensive and unnecessary (before I had a baby). Then I began to realize the awesomeness of being able to see what's going on in the room without actually showing your face - something only a video monitor can provide. So I wanted one but don't have lots of cash to be throwing at an expensive monitor so I got this based on the positive reviews.It works great - we bought the open box one cheaper and it was brand new. That said, there are a few quirks.1. It does mess with our wifi some, as other have said. On our iPad it seems to be ok but on our laptop the wireless pretty much won't work when the monitor is on. It's not that big of a deal for us because we mostly use it for nighttime when we are also asleep. For naps I just flip it on once in awhile to check if I need to use the wifi while he sleeps.2. The VOX (standby) mode is a great option but the monitor is super sensitive so if you use a lot of white noise (we do) it won't ever go on standby. If it does go on standby it will flip back on if a noisy car goes down the street (that's how sensitive it is.3. The caveat to #2 (it staying on all the time) is that the lowest brightness setting is still super bright so, if it doesn't go on standby it's really bright in a dark room. You can turn off the infrared and leave the audio on to fix this but it's a hassle plus defeats the point of having a video monitor. I just put it face down on the dresser, it's still bright but not too bright.4. The loudest setting (9) is not very loud and it doesn't have a discernable \"speaker,\" the noise just kind of comes from within the parent unit. I have not really had a problem with this because I (like most moms) am very sensitive to the noise of him waking so I still hear it. But don't expect a loud audio setting because there is none.5. a minor thing, but still, if the unit is getting ready to die (which it will in less than 3 hours off the charger)it just blinks a green light. There is no noise or anything - our audio monitor beeped loudly a few times to let us know that it was about to die - not this one. Also, it only takes about 30 seconds of it blinking to completely die so you better be paying attention and I don't recommend leaving on all night if it's not hooked up to the charger because you'll likely wake up to a dead monitor and a screaming baby.6. Just a funny thing: it marginally addictive. My husband can't stop watching it. Last night it died about an hour before we went to sleep and my he couldn't stand that it wasn't on. Be warned.7. The video isn't high def or anything. So, it's a little blurry, but everything is still very discernable. It also doesn't have a very wide angle so we, for example, have it about 3 ft above the crib on the wall but can't get the 6\" or so on each end of the crib in the shot. We didn't want to take it farther up because we wanted the picture to still be clear.All that seems like it's bad but I love this monitor, truly. I would purchase it again and again, but I think it's important for potential buyers to know some of these things, because it might not be for you depending on your situation or what kind of parent you are.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent!", "Author": "F.

I assumed I would just get a Summer brand monitor, but then I read the reviews on the Infant Optics and decided for the price it was definitely worth a shot.I'm very impressed with the monitor for the price.  The picture is quite clear, during day or night.  We always keep a small lamp on at night and the light does not interfere with the night-vision camera.  I like the power saving feature (VOX) that you can set for it to turn off after 3 minutes of it not picking up any sound.  I have just a slight problem with this though, as it seems like the microphone is not sensitive enough to pick up small sounds enough to activate the camera again.  If I have this feature on, when I put our son down to sleep, he's not making a ton of noise, so the camera deactivates repeatedly (after 3 minute intervals) before he's fallen asleep.  I just deactivate the VOX feature until he falls asleep.  And anytime I wake up, I just have to push the volume button once and I can check on him.  His cry is definitely loud enough to activate the camera, just not the quiet sounds of him moving around in the bed.I love the convenience of the monitor.

I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that it runs on the same frequency as our wireless internet so using a laptop or using WiFi on your phone is difficult-impossible unless you turn the monitor off. That is the only complaint I have about the device.It has little to no white noise in the background which is nice while you are sleeping. It can be quite bright, but I put a pillow between its light and me and that does the trick for me. The customer care is excellent. We have emailed them twice and received a response very quickly. They are eager to help you and make sure their product is great, even after months of having it.We have had this monitor for 8 months now and continue to love it. I would suggest keeping the camera unit plugged in at all times to keep you from having to constantly plug it in if it dies. Also while you are sleeping, the handheld will die after a few hours if it is not continuously charging.I always recommend this baby monitor to all of our friends because we love it. (except for the frequency hiccup.)***1 Year Later (+ a few months)***Today, our monitor died completely. Previously we had to have the cord replaced and the battery replaced by warranty and had great customer service. Now however, the warranty is gone and the monitor won't turn on. It says it is charging, but no buttons work on it. I am very disappointed that this no longer works because we really thought it was a great value!

We did not have any issues with how the unit functioned; however, the image and sound quality did not provide the detail we were looking for.From a video perspective, the infrared capability was diminished either by distance or viewing obstructed through the crib slats.  Those mounting the camera to look down into a crib and/or from a closer distance may have better results.From an audio perspective, again distance may have proven a factor; however, we do also have a basic, audio-only monitor placed at the same distance which provided superior results.  Audio was unintelligible, and we also experienced a failure of the noise-activated/Vox mode when we were awakened by a screaming child but dormant monitor.  One other note: using this monitor created an audible hum in the audio-only monitor that operates on the same frequency.  We could not, for instance, use this monitor in one child's room while using the audio-only monitor in a second child's room.Overall, this monitor did not operate inconsistent with it's \"value\" promise.

The audio and video is better than the ones I've seen from friends and family, and most importantly there is no internet interference which I was most afraid of - we can NOT live without internet! Everything works as expected and it still works like a charm after dropping it several times (don't be fooled by its fragile-looking plastic material). Parents are reluctant to get a video monitor because it costs a fortune. Not this one! Overall, great monitor at a great price.", "Date": "October 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cannot beat this video monitor for the price! Wish the sound was better though...", "Author": "M. Smith", "ReviewID": "R124BJB4QAOJ06", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We got this monitor a few weeks back when we finally decided to crib train. We had been cosleeping before, but it was time.Mainly, we got this monitor because our son will often make fussing noises in his sleep, or will fuss for a minute or so without actually waking. This meant that with our sound only monitor (NTM-910YLW - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor) we had several false alarms throughout the night, and sometimes even woke him up as we went to his room, when he would have just gone to sleep by himself had we not entered his room. With this unit we can monitor our son and see if we genuinely need to go into his room or if he is fine.I have only TWO complaints about this product:- The sound doesn't get loud enough. I'm a fairly heavy sleeper now that we aren't cosleeping anymore. I have had to use this monitor in conjunction with our Sony baby monitor because the sound is clearer on that unit and the volume can be turned up a lot louder.- The battery does not last long. If we use this monitor at night it has to be plugged in or else it will die at some point in the night. It is good unplugged for our son's naptime in the day, which is normally 2-3 hours long. After that, if we try and turn it on later at bedtime without plugging it in, it dies and shuts off within a few minutes.I want to say, the VOX setting no longer makes beeping noises. I saw some reviews complaining of that, and others saying that it did not have that particular feature. I can confirm that. Both the sound AND the infared have an auto setting, and its easy to adjust those settings.Other than that, no complaints. it was extremely easy to set up, The video is clear and there is very little delay in the video monitor, the signal works well for us (we have a 2 story home), and the infared vision is the bomb diggity. I was hesitant to spend so much on a baby monitor (we bought the above mentioned monitor for less than $20), but I have no regrets and I hope this lasts long enough to use on the next kid we have.", "Date": "October 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "satisfactorio", "Author": "adrian", "ReviewID": "R2PYNUVYZKPPQF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Llego a tiempo son novedades.

Our grandson visits us a few times a month, occasionally overnight, so we decided to look around for a baby monitor to remotely watch him when he naps for sleeps overnight.  We picked this mainly for the price thinking the usage is going to be light anyway.  You will not be able to find any dedicated video baby monitor with infra-red capability any cheaper than this.I may not be shown as a verified purchaser for this because we bought this under my wife's account instead of mine.To our surprise, in many ways this unit works better than others costing much higher.  The image is clear (of course, do not expect it to be as good a picture as a TV picture.)  The audio is clear and loud without static.  Both video and audio can be adjusted up and down.  The infra-red produced a bright, albeit black and white, image even the room was very dark.The nicest feature of this monitor is the rechargeable battery for the monitor.  It is so convenient to carry it around where-ever you go without hunting for outlets.  The battery lasts about 2-3 hours (I did not time it accurately) after a full charge.We did not use the automatic voice activation that much, but it did work when we tried it.The only complaint, if you can call it that, I have is the interference of the 2.4GHz radio with the digital signal transmitted in a 2.4GHz band wireless network from a cable TV tuner to the computer.  However, I believe strongly all 2.4GHz baby monitors would have that problem.  We did have problem with the Summer Infant monitor we bought for our daughter.  Normal internet traffic still will go through, but it does seem to slow down with summer infant but no discernible effect with Infant Optics. I am sure the interference still exists for internet but not severe enough to cause failure of the message resending scheme.

And things you can get if you spend an extra 100 dollars-Probably not as shock proof as the bigger heavier Summer units (but if you are vigilant and don't let your kids get a hold of the monitor then you are fine)-Camera cord is too short (less than half of that of my summer one that broke).  So unless you put it directly above the outlet you may need an extension cord-The Camera attaches to the wall with 2 screws instead of one which is a hassle for leveling and an extra hole in the wall to repair-The Camera requires base attachment (which is included) for downward viewing from a high shelf if you are not attaching it to the wall.  We have shelf that ours sits on.  I am sure this is necessary because the base isn't heavy enough to lean that far forward on its own without flipping over.

The cords couldn't be more than 3-4 feet long.4. Battery life on the monitor is short, you will constantly be charging this thing.5.

This monitor works great and after 3 months of use, we have had no issues! We have even taken it with us on a couple trips and never had an issue. It is extremely durable! The video is very clear and the aux mode is fantastic (and allows us to actually get some sleep too). I love that the video camera can be placed on the wall and is easy to adjust to show the entire crib. Additionally, my husband has a bad case of butterfingers once in awhile and we have a 3 year old who loves to watch his sister on the monitor and the monitor has withstood all they could throw at it. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because there is no audio notification when the battery is dying, only a small red flashing light indication, which does not good when we are sleeping. This has only been an issue once as we usually try and leave it plugged in the charger at night, and during the day the battery life is great - somewhere around 4-6 hours I think. The distance we get is pretty good for the most part too - I can wear the monitor and get reception while I am mowing the grass or work all around the house (2400 sq ft).

We bought this because I had the bad habit of checking on my son too early (I wanted to make sure he actually fell asleep, but whenever he saw me, he'd think it was time to stand up and play - or, I'd hear him cry and I'd walk in to give him his binky, even though he'd have just grabbed it himself and didn't need me, which again, would make him think it was time to get up when he saw me).We had tried an audio monitor before, but didn't really need it. I could hear my son throughout our really small apartment, and it didn't stop me from walking in on him too early because he'd often be quiet for several minutes before actually falling asleep. For moms like me who like to check on their babies, this monitor is perfect. I can see the entire crib, and I can click it on or off whenever I'd like to take a peek. The view isn't as crystal clear as the photo would have you believe, unless you can get a really close-up on your baby, which I can't do because my little one crawls around too much and doesn't stay in one place. But the image is clear enough that I can see when my son is asleep/awake/has his binky/doesn't have his binky/etc. Sometimes my signal blinks like it's too far out of range, which has me worried a little bit for when we move into our bigger house in a couple weeks. I'll be sure to update my review if the range is affected.***Update***We've now owned this monitor for about ... four months or so? Anyway, it still works great. The range is completely fine even for our new larger home. In fact, it might seem weird, but our monitor actually works better in our house (probably because there's more open space?) than it did in our small apartment. Go figure.One problem we've had with it is that the antenna casing isn't too strong. The monitor fell from our bedside table (about two feet high) onto carpet, and the antenna casing broke off. Because the antenna inside the casing is just a metal-ish wire, the monitor still works just fine. But we've now had to glue the casing back on twice. So, I'd recommend putting the monitor somewhere where it won't likely fall.Another problem I've had with it is that the battery life doesn't last too much longer than ... oh, about two and a half hours. This is actually quite a long time, but when we put our son down for the night at 7:30, and then we leave the monitor with a babysitter, I'd like to know that the monitor is going to last the entire time we're gone. So I usually just leave her the cord as well so she can plug it in if need be.Other than those really small complaints though, I really love this product.

I wanted to like it, I really did.  However, as my previous review below mentions, you can't turn off the video without turning off the audio. You can set both up to \"sleep\" and only wake when there is noise.  This is the only option if unless you can sleep through the bright glowing display. Unfortunately, everything wakes up the monitor (except, strangely enough, my daughter talking...which would be the point). Planes flying over, the dog walking around in the hallway (we have hardwood floors) etc all wake it.  Then not only does the audio activate, which would be okay, but the very bright video as well. My husband finally flat out insisted we get rid of  it and we bit the bullet and bought the Summer Infant Touch Video Monitor and LOVE IT.Original Review:I was looking for a reasonably priced option to replace my older video baby monitor that had begun to buzz with static. Based on the reviews I decided to take a chance on this one.I have used this for 3 days so far and am very happy with it.  The video is clear and the audio is free of static. The battery life seems good.My only complaint with the unit is the video display is quite bright even on the lowest setting and there is no way to turn it off and leave just the audio active. My previous monitor had a button that turned video on and off independently of the audio, which I liked.The voice activated power save mode shuts off both video and audio when it senses no audio for 3 minutes.  I have been using this mode since the video is too bright to leave enabled while I am trying to sleep. So far it seems to be working well.  However, it does turn on both video and audio when it activates. I have also noticed that the 65db threshold is possibly a bit too high (meaning it should be a bit more sensitive).  I have a 2 year old and primarily use this to make sure she isn't out of bed playing in her room when she is supposed to be sleeping but if you had a small infant you might want the unit to activate when the child is making noise at a volume lower than 65db.So overall I find this to be a solid unit.

This isn't the best monitor out there but I'm pleased with the performance for the price you pay. The video is excellent, and all the features works as advertised. The automute function is good if you want to keep your monitor on constantly while you sleep (with vox mode off).

You cannot adjust the sensitivity of this.  You CAN turn \"VOX\" off, but then the video stays on the whole time and eats up a lot of the battery.  Plus, you don't really want that staring you in the face all night long.The problem with it for us is that my daughter wakes up from both naps and nighttime pretty quietly.  She'll just keep herself busy in her crib for up to 30 minutes or so before she starts giving us the, \"Ok, where is everybody?\" type noises.

The picture quality is OK, but it's a bit wonky when you have the Auto Night Mode on which it is by default, as it sometimes tries to transition back and forth too much depending on how much light there is. Audio is loud enough, but tinny. The VOX mode conservers battery life by disabling the speaker when no noise is being made, and then having the monitor go into sleep mode when there is no noise for a few minutes. It then comes back on when there is some noise detected. Range is fine, as we can have the camera and the monitor at opposite ends of our house. I did not experience any interference with other devices. It is supposed to offer privacy encryption to prevent other people from picking up your signal and seeing your baby, but I had no way that I know of to prove or test that.

With VOX active which it is by default, the battery fully charged can last around 9 hours. With VOX off and the monitor always on, the battery fully charged lasts between 3-4 hours. It is recommended to keep the monitor plugged in with the AC adapter for prolonged monitoring, like using it overnight, so that it doesn't shut off on you from low charge.It's definitely a good deal at the $100 price point, but at the higher price points which it is now at, for it to be worth it, it would have to offer better audio and video, maybe a bigger screen, and be built of better material so that it doesn't have the \"cheapy\" feeling.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great monitor for a great price", "Author": "jettysmom", "ReviewID": "RSWY7AG8NMUC6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We only paid $99 for this monitor and it works great!

After reading the reviews this seemed like the right monitor for us, after all it has a rating of 4 stars. We were sorely mistaken.  Here are pros and cons we have found.Pros1. Big screen that works2. Light weight3. The only reason this got 2 stars from me and the only saving grace is that is has good picture quality. In the dark i can clearly see if my daughters eyes are open and she is awake.Cons1. In the picture of the monitor it looks like it comes with 2 power adapters. Mine only came with one. You need the second adapter because the battery will not last all night, effectively not hold a charge. It dies after 4 or so hours. The part that stays with you so you can see the baby needs to be plugged in if you want to use it overnight, but the camera has to be plugged in in order for it to work. So 2 adapters are needed.2. If you have a big house or even an average sized house, this is not for you. It says it has a 800 foot range but i believe it is less than that maybe more like half that. The \"out of signal\" beep and screen comes up all the time when i am trying to get things done around the house.3. After about a month of use the feedback from the volume got so loud that you can't hear anything that is going on in the nursery. So i have to keep the volume on zero so i don't here a loud buzzzzzzzing noise when it is on. The louder you turn up the volume, the louder the buzz is. So functionally there is no sound. That's a problem, that is why i bought the thing, so i could see and HEAR the baby.I wish i had paid a little more attention to the negative reviews of this product before i bought it. I should have been more suspect of the $300 monitor for $99, there is a reason why it is $99. My advice- spend a little more and get something that doesn't have reviews all over the board.

After that it just died a slow death cutting off and on unexpectedly.  I suspect that it may just be the lithium battery however, the manufacturer makes it very clear that they do not warranty the rechargeable battery.  And the unit will not work on its own while plugged in without the battery (or at least mine would not).  Emails, which the manufacturer recommends vice a phone call, to customer service have not been returned.  Very disappointed overall and Amazon will not accept it back as a return without prorating my potential refund after I return at my own cost.I will lay out the pros and cons below for those of you that want to roll the dice with this product.  My issue could just be bad luck however I suspect that this is an endemic problem with the product:PROS:- Value:  Great potential bang for the buck.- Picture and sound are good and night vision works well.- Voice activated auto off and on feature works relatively well and is sensitive (maybe too sensitive but I like knowing that it is picking up our little one's noises).- Has a wall mount (and stand alone mode) for camera which is a must when you want to look down into the crib.- Played very well with the two WiFi routers in my house.CONS:- Monitor is light and feels cheaply made.  If it hits the ground, this thing is toast.- Lithium battery doesn't last long at all, even on the battery saving mode with voice activation .  You will be lucky to get an hour or two off the charger.- No low battery or shut off audible tone.  Which means when this thing dies you will have no idea that it has stopped monitoring your little one.  This is a big issue and is unacceptable when you experience the issues as I detailed above.- Makes a \"click\" sound when it is activated.  It isn't super loud but at night it will wake you and is super annoying.- Loses signal with camera frequently, even when in close proximity.  It will regain signal after a simple reset, but this is really annoying as well.- Uses side volume and contrast up and down button in combinations to activate features like voice activation.  Easy to use once you get used to it however try teaching it to the grandparents or babysitter on the fly and you will see why this is such a bad idea.- In comparison to other cameras with night vision, the LED lights are very bright.  While the light is much less than say a dim night light it is still not up to par with other comparable cameras.- Kick stand for monitor is flimsy and doesn't hold up the unit very well.- Monitor antenna is just begging to be broken off, again poor construction overall.", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works really well but we have wi-fi interference", "Author": "Vincent Bronte \"Ciela\"", "ReviewID": "R3HLZXE5IDQR3K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The monitor itself works brilliantly.

I was very disappointed. There were many negatives:- I couldn't hear almost anything. I was using it to monitor my elderly mother in her room. Even when I turned the voice activation feature off and volume all the way up, I couldn't hear her moan from her bed. I tried to give the monitor the benefit of the doubt b/c the reviews had been so good, but then when she had two visitors to her room, less than 10 feet away from the video monitor, and they were having a full-fledged conversation, I could barely hear a few murmurs if I pressed my ear right up to the monitor's speakers but I couldn't make out a single word! My only other experience with a monitor was Summer Infant 02090 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007OD8SU/ref=wms_ohs_product), which has AMAZING sound capture (I could hear my baby *breathing* on this monitor, even from a few feet away). This monitor really didn't help for being alerted by sound.- The video quality was not great. Then again, I was comparing to my only experience with the aforementioned monitor, which has amazing picture clarity, even at nighttime. In addition, the video doesn't turn off, nor can you turn it off, to save battery power. Keeping video on all the time drains power very quickly. This is perhaps why the battery life is only about 3 hours instead of my other monitor's 10 hours.- Short range. I should have read the specifications more closely, but when she was on one end of the medium-sized house (not a mansion) and I was on the other side, the signal was lost and I couldn't not hear or see anything.- Loud beeps when the signal was lost. Um, this is really disruptive when you're sleeping and these loud beeps wake you up at night.- When I unplugged the camera and plugged it back in, the camera defaulted to being off. Which means, as one other reviewer mentioned, if there is a power outage and then the power comes back on, you'd have to go back into your baby's room to manually turn the camera back on. I don't know about your baby, but since mine was a light sleeper, my going into her room meant that I would wake her up. I don't know why the camera has to have an on/off button. My other monitor doesn't. In addition, and this is probably a defect in mine, when I unplugged the camera, plugged it back in, and pressed the on button, it wouldn't turn on. After about 10 minutes, then the on button would work and I could turn it on. This is not acceptable to me.- With my other monitor, I could just prop out the clip and make it stand up on a table or countertop. One step. With this monitor, I have to slide out the clip, then pull it out to be able to stand it up on a table. Plus, the clip wobbles, so it doesn't feel firm and sturdy. I am constantly propping it up or closing the clip, so one step versus two steps is a big deal. Plus this monitor's stand does not feel sturdy.- As other people have mentioned, the plastic feels flimsy and is very lightweight. Some people may like lightweight, but it makes moving the camera a little too easy.I returned this monitor for the aforementioned reasons. I decided to just get another one of the monitor I currently have, even though it's not a current model (I'll get it used from another site).

I think the best one (that I haven't tested yet) is the Motorola MBP36 but it sells for $239.Here some pros and cons of the ones I've tested: Lorex LW2451Pros:- Very good video quality- Very good infrared/night video quality- Very good video FPS (frames per second), very fluid video (like a professional security camera)- 3.5\" monitor- Charging Docking Station. The battery life is really good because you don't really think about it, when it sits on the station it's always charging (this is a big plus)- PTZ- Button to turn ON and OFF whenever you like to- Good and simple options menu- Good options- microSD for video recording- Video recording with button- Video recording with voice activation- Very good price- No interference with the WiFi (2.4Ghz or 5Ghz)- It works as webcam for Skype when connected to the PC via USB (I hoped it worked wirelessly as well but it doesn't, it's a big plus anyway. Extremely easy installation)Cons:- SOUND TOO LOW (best monitor I've had but this is a deal breaker. NOT SAFE! Wait for new model, hopefully they will change the microphone)- Voice activation (VOX) not working very well (since the microphone is not the best, sometimes you need too much noise and you can hear the baby from the room before than through the monitor)- Not too long power cable. Hard to mount high points on wall Infant Optics DXR-5Pros:- Very good price for the options you get- Good video quality- Very good infrared/night video quality- Good video FPS (frames per second), fluid video- Best voice activation (VOX) I've tried. This can also be annoying since it will turn on on every little movement during the night but I like to see the baby is safe every time he moves or every time he makes a noise, I really like this feature.- Best noise isolation I've tried- Extremely simple options (4 buttons total, very well explained)- Stand included (even if not needed in my opinion, the monitor is alreay designed to stand by itself)- Clip (my wife liked this, she was able to go outside with the monitor on her jeans all the time)Cons:- Awful battery life (constantly in charge)- No button to turn the video ON whenever you like to- It doesn't turn ON on VOX (someone may like this better?). It turns ON on \"always ON\"- It literally kills your WiFi (this was my deal breaker with this monitor). I own an IT company and I install WiFi networks for companies, there was no way to get this to work with any channel and any router (I now have one of the best WiFi N900 routers installed, the ASUS RT-N66U). If you use 5Ghz band you will be fine but not every device has this possibility. I had to literally shut the monitor down to stream HD movies to my Boxee Box (no 5Ghz available on the Boxee Box), also unable to transfer files between laptops or iPhone- Not too long power cable. Hard to mount high points on wall Motorola MBP33Pros:- Very good video quality- Very good infrared/night video quality- Good video FPS (frames per second), fluid video (better than the DXR-5 but worse than the LW2451)- Amazing microphone, it is actually an external microphone like the ones you buy for computers, it also seem you get stereo audio from it. Just for this kind of microphone, the MBP33 is the safest monitor I've tested- No interference with the WiFi (2.4Ghz or 5Ghz)- When it goes off idleing, you can turn it on pressing any button. If you hurry when you hear something just press a button and look (awesome function)- Long power cable- It doesn't isolate the static noise of the room (the DXR-5 is the best for that) (changing this to a Pro feature. If you hear static you always know the monitor works and it's capturing audio also you can hear your son breathe.Cons:- No Pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) (you get that with $60 more, with the MBP36. I don't think this option and the VOX are worth $60)- No voice activation (VOX)UPDATE:The MBP33 stopped working about two weeks ago (we were oversea for vacation!), it lasted long time and speakers just break. I've opened it, tried to solder the speaker again, made a mess and Motorola didn't even blink. They, with Amazon, refunded me right away, no questions.I am ordering a new one, same model, right now and change the rating to 5 stars.

Not pleasant, especially if they start crying.4)  Its lack of fuctions/options make it worthless.  Yes, it's simple to use, but not worth $100.

Comparing to other baby monitor of a popular brand we bought for our daughter, this has a great value. That one currently costs double as much as this one.  When I bought that on sale, it was about the same price as this Infant Optics model.  The night vision for Infant Optics actually is clearer.  The night vision is black and white, but I believe that all the monitors, including the security cameras I owned, are like that.  It has two useful features:  rechargeable battery and VOX mode.  The fully charged battery, unfortunately would last about 1 1/2 to 2 hours with the screen on.  I did not check the battery duration under VOX mode.  So-called VOX mode allows the screen to turn itself off after 3 minutes of silence.  The screen will turn back on when the mic detects sound.  This works well during sleep, so that you will not be bothered by the bright screen.  The firmware on this unit must have been changed since the other reviews indicated that the VOX was always on and complained about annoying beeps when it was activated.  I can change the VOX on or off by pressing the volume + and the brightness + button together and there were no beeps when VOX is activated.  Kudos to the manufacturers for listening to the customers.I have a very extensive wireless WIFI networks: one with 2.4MHz and one with 5MHz.  The 5MHz carrying TV signals around the house was not affected at all.  The four relatively new 802.11n routers for the 2.4MHz carry the internet traffic with no problem, but one 802.11g router carrying the security camera signal on this network cannot deliver the signal to the computers when the baby monitor was on.  This performance with interference actually is better than the other baby monitor which was operated also on 2.4Mhz band, but not with spread spectrum scheme.Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase.  Few days of usage did not present any problem at all.  I would have given it a five star rating if the screen was bigger and the battery lasted longer.

(farm use review)", "Author": "WolfQueen13", "ReviewID": "R1HZOU20OKSG0Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I actually purchased this to use as a barn cam because I breed pygmy goats & going out every 30 minutes doesnt help my nerves any during kidding season which is already stressful lol. I bought this one specifically because of price & good ratings. My current kidding area is probably less than 100ft from house & the cam is attached to the wooden framing inside.Overall im very pleased. Working it along with set up, & installation was easy once I found the area I wanted the cam & marked the points where the screws were to be (it says in the manual. I think its like 5cm apart). One screw was a bit off, but I just hammered it even no issue.Signal is pretty fair considering I keep the monitor either in my kitchen (middle of my house) or the opposite end of my home from the barn. Depending on where I place the monitor it either gets great or OK signal, but it does lose it here & there, but 90% of the time corrects its self shortly after. To remedy the obnoxious lost signal beeping I set the volume to 3 or 4 so I cant still here anything important but the beeping is less noticeable. You also get used to it after a while. If the signal doesnt come back I either readjust the monitor or if that doesnt work I switch it through cams & go back to one & it works. A good thing is that when it does lose it you can still hear some sound if it detects any. I cant picture this losing signal from one room to another.Even though this is made of cheapy feeling plastic its a tough little thing. Ive had dogs' tails catch the charging wire & have had it crash to the floor multiple times. One time it landed smack in the dogs' water dish, which has since been moved, & after a night in the rice in a warm place its still works great (after removing all bits of rice that made inside of course). Recently my mother has dropped it & snapped off the antena...twice xP. After a good round of super glue its good as new. One thing I did note is that even withought the plastic antena cap the wire inside didnt seem to need the plastic piece, but I reattached it anyway ;).Infrared works great & the light adjusting really helps! My issue with this is that I mounted the camera near a corner (cam view cant cover the entire stall which is at least 10x10 so I was aiming for the corner they were using the most) & because I put it a bit too far in the corner I turned the lense to the right. Well in daylight it works great but the IR doesnt go that angle so the bottom right corner gets blacked out at night. Of course after the cam was put in the goats started using the corner I couldnt see *hair pull*.There arent many things I would change but there are a few. I know its not intended for barn use, but I would have the screen view larger. Like I said the lense got maybe a 1/3 of that stall. I do plan to remedy this by getting the 3 other cams when I have the extra money, & ive extended my pens so the does get a new barn anyways (boys get the old one), & I will be adding screws in several places to mount the cams wherever works at the time. The new barn is 10x16 so getting better views should be easier. While the monitor stands up to abuse I would have it more water tight. Its not sealed at all & has open areas where you could stick a syringe or dropper easily. A spilt juice cup would have no issue getting fluid in. Considering this is for use around infants & toddlers you would think it would be more sealed!The last thing is BATTERY LIFE. It doesnt last long, which I knew, but it would ne nice if it didnt putter out every 3-4 hours if that. Thats actually why its kept in the kitchen a lot. I keep it plugged in so it doesnt go out, & I dont realize it. Outside I dont keep it on me because it isnt needed. Generally when I go out for lunch or whatever ill unplug it that way the battery doesnt totally caput, & I just turn it on & plug it back in when I get home.Overall im really pleased with this.

We had the camera installed over the crib, which meant my son just kept on staring at it.2) The video quality at night is poor.  Not a deal killer, but compared to the Summer monitor, definitely unacceptable.3) The sound is TERRIBLE.  If we had the sound turned over 3 bars, a buzz starts going on and off, on and off.  I'd be okay if it's just a constant buzz like white noisy, but it's sporatic, making it impossible for us to sleep.  There's a humidifier in the baby's room, so maybe that's causing the monitor to go nuts, but whatever it is, it's very annoying.4) The deal killer: for all the annoy sound problems we had, I was still too lazy to return the product.

This is one of those time; I don't get the great reviews for this thing.  I've tried a number of different cameras for my two boys (currently aged 2.75 years and 1 month), and this is one of the worst.  It will be shipped back to Amazon presently.Here are the things that make this a bad option for my family (things I wish I would have known before shelling out nearly $200 for the system with one extra camera):1) The cameras and parent unit are CHEAP plastic. They feel about as light and well-made as a Happy Meal Toy. The buttons are cheap, the flip-up camera is really hard to position and it's hard to imagine that either will last with heavy use.2) Setup is way harder than it needs to be.  \"Pairing\" the camera with the monitor is tricky.  It should be easy.  It's not.3) In voice-activation mode, the key selling feature of the unit, the sound is activated only when there's a noise from the child's room. That's well enough, but there doesn't seem to be a way that I can see of turning off the display in this mode.  So the display stays on if the system is on.  But then again, I have found the system unexpectedly turned off on a couple of occasions. So who know?!4) Image quality is average.  Nothing special here.  I will say that if the camera isn't pretty close to the child, the image is hard to decipher if the room is dark.5) Switching between cameras is not intuitive. Then again, neither is anything else about this system.6) For me, the biggest problem--the camera has no pan ability. If you have an immobile newborn, this might not be an issue. But if you have a toddler who likes to move around, then this camera will not suffice...unless of course you want to position multiple cameras in his/her room.  (But see #5 for the issue with that idea.)I gave 2 stars because the unit turned on and worked, at least sporadically. But my strong recommendation is to pay a few more dollars for a better system.

The VOX feature is nice but had difficulty getting it into that mode and then once it was in VOX we were not able check on our son, only if he was loud enough to turn the monitor back on.

I returned it and had a replacement sent, assuming I'd received a lemon. The replacement monitor worked fine, but I'm overall just not satisfied with the monitor for a couple of reasons. First, the sound quality isn't very good. Compared to the Motorola, it sounds tinny and isn't very loud. Second, the transition from night camera to day camera doesn't occur as it should. When I wake up and want to look at my daughter in daylight I find that the night camera is still on even though it is daytime and I can't see her at all. The screen is very dark. Eventually it does transition, but it's never visible early in the morning when I actually need it. The upsides to it are of course the price, the camera has a pretty good visibility range, the night vision is pretty clear, and the battery life on the handheld piece is pretty good. The deal breaker for me is the night to day camera transition. What is the point of having the monitor if you can't always see your kid? If this isn't an issue for you, go for it.

So I bought this one based on the mostly positive reviews. Meh. People are clearly only impressed with this one if they haven't ever owned the other. I myself wouldn't use this Infant Optics monitor with an infant. The video quality is too inferior. You would not be able to see details such as the chest going up and down when you want to check the baby's breathing in the night, either out of general nightly paranoia that new parents have or because the baby has a cold or if a child has asthma, whatever. On the Summer monitor you can see that. The Infant Optics picture is really digitalized looking, not finely detailed. It's ok for our 4 yo because all I need to see is if he's in his bed or about to fall out of it as he can sometimes do. I keep the sound on constantly because I don't want any issues with not hearing him call for me. The camera that's placed in the baby's room - nobody has mentioned this and I can't fathom why - it is lit up all bright like a freaking UFO. It's crazy. It lights up the room enough to almost serve as a night light. There are several bright bright red lights around the eye of the camera and a blue or green light on top that bounces off the ceiling illuminating the room. (I covered up the top light and it helped; on the Summer monitor it had one bright green light and I always covered that one too.) To people with new babies, or parents of a child who really struggles to fall asleep, your child may lay there and stare at the red lights, not fall asleep. And there's no way you could do something like we did with the Summer monitor, which was place the camera inside the crib just a foot away from our swaddled newborn so we could see him so close up we could monitor his breathing all night very easily both by sight and sound. If you put this camera inside the crib your baby would not sleep a wink all night long. I'm really glad I saved our old faulty Summer monitor because I don't have a huge amount of confidence this one will last very long, based on how flimsy it feels. But that's an impression not an actual experience with its reliability. Will check in later in that regard. Still, another reviewer said they wished they'd just sprung for the Summer monitor again and that's how I feel too in comparing the two products.Update: I am returning this monitor. I'm done. I was already not happy with the quality of the sound and last night what I suspected would happen did happen -- my son woke and called for me and I didn't hear it at first because the sound was so quiet, muffled and distorted. He's saying \"Mom\" but all I could hear was a weird sound that reminded me of recordings of whales singing underwater. It's ridiculous.

This thing works great, in theory. The camera and display are good to very good. The packaging and manual are well done. The problems we (my wife and I) have are with the monitor.The clip on the back sucks. There's no two ways about that. It's this fiddly slide/lock, stand/clip contraption. A simple spring clip would have worked, with a flip out foot also. But, like the rest of this thing, that'd be too easy. The super cheap feeling foot/clip always feels like it's going to break (though it hasn't) and never quite locks in the position you want it in.The screen is good, excellent contrast, and enough brightness that it lights your whole room up like daylight, waking you and your partner up. To boot, the battery is already shot - or it just sucks. I can't tell which. But, I do know it can't make it through a night off the charger, and it seems to forget all the settings when it dies. The most annoying part is the \"VOX\" feature. It's supposed to only turn on the display when the baby moves or makes noise. Problem is, the VOX feature seems to turn itself off all the time, so the diamond bright display stays on all the time. Also, if a mouse farts or the baby's eyelash moves, the display comes on. My wife doesn't have an easy time remembering how to change the settings, nor what they all do.If we never had another monitor, maybe we'd like this one, but we don't. Our Summer monitor is a big dumb receiver, with a small not very good screen. However, it has a LED noise level indicator, and a simple \"whack it when you want to see it\" button on top. With that monitor, we turn it on, and if the kid makes noise, we see/hear the indicator \"level up.\" If we want to see the kid, we press the big ole button on top and the video is active for 3 minutes, then it goes off. A simple green glowey LED tells us it's on. All that is too simple for this Infant Optics super complex reads your baby's mind and turns on 99 features when you want 2. If our new baby makes noise, this sucker lights up like the sun for some period of time, then turns itself off. I mean, turns itself off. It SHOULD go back to sleep, but it doesn't. It goes off. I can't tell if it's defective, or the battery is dead. If I plug it back in, then turn the VOX feature back on, it sorta behaves.

You can't beat $100 for a video monitor.-Very easy to set up.

It's not really that big of a deal, we just need to be better about bringing the cord with us and keeping it plugged in.-The biggest thing we don't like is that there isn't any warning when the battery dies.

The price and overall performance are good. Seems to get good reviews. However, I've since decided to replace it.  The reason being is that at least once a week, the monitor in our room drops signal and loudly beeps at us telling us so.  It's plugged in, in the same place every night, signal strength is good/light display is solid.  Everyone is tucked away in bed, not walking in front of it, etc.  We can't figure any reason for it to just drop signal but when it does, it wakes us up, I have to turn the monitor off then back on and then it's fine.  When you value your sleep as much as we do with a baby, this is unacceptable.  Granted, we live in an older house with plaster walls, the baby's room is separated from our room by another room and a bathroom, and most nights it works fine, but other nights, it inexplicably drops signal.  In other areas of the house, the reception is spotty but we've figured out the places it works and yes, if someone walks in front of it, etc, it may temporarily drop signal but then pops back on.  No dice in the middle of the night.  It drops signal and for whatever reason, it stays dropped.  So if one is inclined to sleep through the (loud) noise indicating the signal has dropped, then our monitor is now off.  The baby's camera is mounted to the wall, above her crib.  Seems fine.If anyone has any suggestions, aside from kicking it to the curb, I'd love to hear them.  Again, it only does this maybe once or twice a week, but that's an unnecessary wake up, so it's being replaced.If you live a small house with dry wall, perhaps you won't have this problem.

The first thing a I noticed after a couple of months was that it was staying charged for shorter and shorter periods of time. At one point the charger stopped working and we got a new one, however even with the new one the monitor only stays on if its plugged in. It won't hold a charge for even a minute, which gets annoying when your trying to do stuff around the house and can't carry it. The next thing that happened is that the antennae piece broke off really easily, leaving a wire sticking out. Not too big a deal, still works fine. The other thing that bothered us was that you have to keep the camara within a couple feet of the bed or else the screen becomes to dark and pixelated to make your child out.

I didn't mind that it was light or plasticy.  I didn't mind that it didn't have pan/tilt/zoom. I just wanted a good monitor I could use for my two kids.  This wasn't it.Our main problems:1)  The auto mute and VOX functions were great ideas - had they worked.  But to get the sound to trigger there has to be a LOUD noise.  So basically instead of being able to hear my child sitting up and singing or playing softly, she would have to yell or cry for me to know she was awake.  By way of example, my two year old got a stomach bug and vomitted in her toddler bed one night around midnight.  I didn't know it until she started becoming really agitated and started to yell (she is quiet little one and doesn't cry/yell much).  I have no idea how long she was covered in sick before that finally triggered and woke me up.  The final straw came when, at 2am, she somehow made her way into our room and woke us up to tell us her paci was missing.  The monitor never picked up her calling for us, nor getting out of her bed and leaving the room. Up to that point she had never left her bed or room at night.  Now I worry that the \"seal is broken\" on that behavior so to speak.  That was the night we decided this monitor went back.Apart from audio the other small quirks that annoyed us:2)  There is no Audio Only mode.  The best you can do is set it on Voice Activated (VOX).  This means that you either have to sleep with the VERY bright display on all night, or you have to wait to have the VOX triggered by something loud. As a parent of a newborn you may not mind having the video on all night.  But trust me, at some point you will mind.  When it IS triggered the screen automatically pops on.  Also annoying at 2am.3)  When VOX goes off after a period of silence, it first flashes to a BRIGHT white \"title screen\".  That bright white flash itself has woken me up more than once.  It is ridiculously bright and I can't understand what purpose it serves.4)  The night vision lights on the camera are BRIGHT RED in a ring around the lens.  There are plenty of other brands that have invisible IRs.  The red lights freaked my 2 year old out for days until we finally told her they were her own personal Christmas Lights.5)  There is no easy way, once in VOX and there hasn't been an activating sound, to just pop the camera on for a quick view.  I tried pushing the \"brightness\" toggle and the \"P\" button on the front of the monitor.  Both worked in popping the camera ON but a) there was no way to pop it back off again until the VOX setting once again triggered, and b) half the time it would somehow then turn the VOX setting off so the camera would stay on and on and on until I checked and reset the VOX setting.I will grant that the video quality and night quality is good.  That's what kept us holding on for so long.  But we just couldn't do it after my daughter needed us TWICE and the monitor failed to alert us. What else is a monitor for?  We could have purchased an audio-only monitor to go along with this one but by then we'd have spent just as much money as getting a better quality monitor.We've since purchased the Summer Baby Touch (thanks to a wonderful review by \"Alison\" going over that and the Motorola we were considering step by step) and we're VERY happy with it.

However, I'm also college educated (2 bachelors degrees and a masters), so I'd think some things would just be common sense for a baby product.  Here is my take on this monitor:1) If you accidentally forget to turn the camera on and turn the handheld monitor on first, the handheld issues an EXTREMELY LOUD series of beeps to alert that the camera is out of range.  Great if the camera is out of range, awful if you're standing right next to your sleeping infant because you wanted to check and make sure the camera angle was set properly.  Ooooops.2) The screen on the hand-held NEVER turns off.  EVER.  EVER, EVER, EVER.  Unless it runs out of batteries.  (I'll get to that in #3)  So now imagine you've gotten your sleeping bundle of joy to sleep and (gasp!) you want to sleep.  Nope.  The handheld will glow like the surface of the sun unless you cover it with something.  Then you cover it with something and muffle the sounds of your super impatient, hungry baby.  Oh, yes, the same baby that you couldn't see move because you had to cover the screen.  Oooops.3)  Let's say that you've overcome obstacles 1 and 2.  Now you're asleep, the tiny screaming bundle of joy is asleep, and the monitor is appropriately dimmed with an ironic eye mask that you should just put on your face.  Oh no!  You forgot to plug the handheld in to the wall.  Guess how long the battery lasts?  Answer: less time than your infant will sleep.  Because that's how Murphy's law works.  It WILL start beeping.

Hubscher", "ReviewID": "R2R5P66ZEH7MEW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We bought this monitor and an additional camera after our old summer video monitor (which we loved) started to have some issues and we couldn't replace it b/c they don't make that model anymore.  We were hopeful based on the great reviews, but once we tried to use it, we were extremely disappointed.  The night vision on our unit is useless (even with several nighlights in the room), it is so pixelated that we can't see our daughter in her bed at all.  The sound, which others described as \"tinny\", is horrible.  I could hear my daughter more clearly through the door down the hall than through the monitor, it wasn't a volume issue, just very bad sound quality.  It also cut in and out with no rhyme or reason.  I definitely don't think that I would be at all comfortable using this monitor for an infant.  As it is, this was our daughter's first night in her big girl bed, and I'm having to sneak in to her room to make sure she is okay and still in her bed, because I can't even make out her form in the bed or hear anything.  We will most certainly be returning this product, since it doesn't work at all as described.  Maybe we were spoiled by our summer monitor, but I want to be able to see my child clearly in the light or dark and hear them.  I'm writing this review, because this product had a lot of 5 star reviews, and frankly, those swayed me to purchase it...I really can't conceive of how it gets so many glowing reviews even at the price point.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very average product that broke first time we dropped it", "Author": "Ryan J.

This is our second video monitor, with our first being a Summer Infant, so I'm not completely new to how a video monitor should work.  I've owned this monitor for about 3 months.  One of the reasons I'm writing this review today is because I woke up to my son screaming and crying last night, and the monitor was sitting on the nightstand right next to me without a signal from the camera.  This happens CONSTANTLY, it will not stay connected to the base.The camera sits about 30' from the monitor, which is by no means out of the advertised signal range.  When it loses the signal, it warns the user with a loud beep.  About every other night, it will beep in the middle of the night waking me up, and I'll pick it up to check on my son only to realize that it beeped because the signal was lost, not because the camera base was picking up noise in his room.  The ONLY way I can get the signal to pick back up is to uplug the monitor from the wall and switch through all cameras (supports up to 4) until I get back to camera 1.  This makes no sense whatsoever.  When it's running on battery, the signal strength and connection is perfectly fine, but it can't run off battery all night.I have also found the voice activated power saving mode really takes excessive noise/commotion to wake up the monitor.  The camera sits about 3 feet from my son's crib, and when I'm directly below his room in our house, I can hear him moving around and kicking his mattress with the monitor still sleeping. The are a couple PROS, but the CONS really make it stand out.PROS:1) Price2) Video quality (when it has signal)CONS:1) Build quality2) Signal strength3) Voice activated power saving modeFrom my standpoint, I'm not sure where the positive reviews are coming from, this product is completely untrustworthy.  I would never rely on it for an infant, that's why our Summer Infant monitor is in our daughter's room.  Based on my experiences, spend a little more money and go with a Motorola or Summer Infant.
