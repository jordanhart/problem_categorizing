{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Easy set up, quality picture", "Author": "Jen \"Geek Girl\"", "ReviewID": "R1LXAKGCE6WI7R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First let me state that I'm a novice when it comes to security systems. As a single mom who travels extensively, I needed a way to protect my home when I'm away. My home does not really allow for a convenient wired security system and I'm not really a fan of cords being strewn about my house. Plus, I have my reservations about how secure wired systems are when their power can so easily be severed. With this wireless system, even if one of the cameras was discovered and rendered useless, the others are still fully functional. Also, given the wireless option, it's very easy to hide the receiver so that even if the cameras are destroyed, the receiver is still functional and has stored all the data.As for this particular model, it was exceedingly simple to set up. I had tried a previous wireless solution and the picture quality, while good enough to see what is going on in a completely dark room, was not good enough to identify facial features of the intruder. This system appears to have much better picture quality and in testing in a completely dark room from 40+ feet away from the camera, I could clearly see myself and my actions, and when coming closer to the camera, I could clearly see my facial features. I left it set up in total darkness for a few days and was able to clearly identify every person who entered the room. I also had the opportunity to test the cameras out in sub zero temps and after a few days found icicles forming on them, but no loss at all to picture quality. Definitely a quality wireless solution for smaller areas or as an addition to a larger system. I've paired this with another 4 camera set by the same manufacturer and everything works flawlessly.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice camera/DVR set up - how about instructions?", "Author": "P. MSakamoto \"boy clothes\"", "ReviewID": "R1L4G7QL2THYT1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would rate this as an even better setup if the maker could manage to put real instructions in the box instead of the minimal quick start version included. It is just not enough to really get this installed properly. For instance, it does not tell about using the VGA monitor capability (I was able to do it without too much trouble, but they should let folks know). Also, my package came with some confusing info about using the wired video cable version. This setup is wireless, so the other info was just confusing.The main thing you really need to worry about with this setup is providing AC power within reach of the camera power bricks, and you are set!", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Defender 21291", "Author": "SevereWX", "ReviewID": "R1ZUJGIBCKEZON", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Defender Sentinel wireless system is an easy to install 4 camera system with 500GB DVR. The installation was easy, AFTER I went to the hardware store to purchase  the necessary screws and wall anchors, as the Defender system didn't come with any mounting hardware of any sort.  The cameras can be vertical wall mounted, but are not meant to be mounted from a ceiling.The power cords for the cameras and receivers are of ample length, though the one for the DVR was incredibly short and needed an extension cord to reach an outlet. Of note, the power plug on the back of the DVR does not make good contact and will cause the DVR to reboot if lightly touched.The video quality, even at the system's highest D1 resolution is poor. For facial recognition or license plate identification, the person or plate must be 10 feet or closer to the camera to be recognizable/readable. IR performance is acceptable for what can be seen, the problem is a good half of the daytime field of view is gone in nighttime IR mode due to severe vignetting.Wireless performance is about 60 feet maximum for a steady wireless signal that doesn't drop out, and that is through one exterior wall consisting of drywall, insulation, pine studs, and vinyl siding. Any distance farther than about 60 feet and you can expect the signal to drop out several times per hour.The wireless cameras seem to operate on the 2.4 GHz band, as using this system renders my 2.4 GHz WIFI useless. It interferes and blocks the wifi so that nothing can connect. The 5 GHz band is unaffected, so make sure all your wireless network devices have the option to use 5 GHz should you purchase this wireless CCTV system. It also interferes with my cordless DECT phones causing a lot of digital clicking and popping noises that go away when power is removed from the wireless cameras.The networking feature of this system is very nice and works perfectly, even with smart-phone monitoring when using the ASEE software available for free on Google Play and iTunes store. I would recommend turning off the UPnP feature and remote monitoring/control features if you don't need them though, as the firmware provided is susceptible to very simple hacking from the internet; the security flaws are profound and have not been fixed. A simple Google search will net you more information on this.Overall, this is okay for a hobby / entry-level CCTV system if you are aware of it's real-world usage limitations. I would not choose this system for any critical security applications.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "I Spy", "Author": "mk", "ReviewID": "R2GRDIPGVDFGU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This security video package allows one to farily simply set-up surveillance about ones' home with a reasonable price and a decent night vision to boot.They provide 4 cameras, 2 receptor units, a main box and lots of wires.  I followed the quick start info and no problems.  I, also, visited the website which shows you a lot of options, videos on how to do things, and other stuff to expand your security system.I placed one camera outside, screwed it to the patio ceiling upside down.  Indeed, the image is upside down, if that matters, not sure how to correct that.  I have a ceiling plug to attach the power to the camera.  Basically, the camera's wire inserts into the coupling of the plug that plugs into the outlet.  A receptor inside the house with two antennae manages signals from two cameras and plugs into the main box which plugs into a monitor of some sort, e.g. a tv.Yes, there are a lot of wires to attach, and they give you a fair amount of wire; however, I kept the cameras close to outlets.  The remaining cameras I put inside in different rooms.  Everything worked right as it should, didn't have to rely on computers or downloading right off.  I plan to hook it up via their website later when we travel to view on my netbook.Now, the fun part is watching the four screens together, separately, or rotating through each camera periodically on the monitor.  The night vison is very good(they state 75').  The camera's eye has a show of red dots, and I truly feel like I have one of those security systems one sees in buildings.  I just need my guard's uniform and a comfy chair at my security station.This thing has a lot of potential, and I'm just starting to explore it.  I like it a lot, but it does require a bunch of wires and plugs.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00FYV8WEG"}}
