Dont believe the seller or his description of this product. The seller wrote me 3 emails basically saying the same thing as his online description said. However, It didn't make the piece crap work. I'm stuck with this piece of crap and now I' out another $16 for a sd card. Before purchasing anything from this guy contact me... I've discovered his truck... Purchase defective products for pennies and sell them on amazon. All the time hoping you miss the deadline for his worthless crap.

First even though the video quality is very good the view angle is way too narrow to be of any use. Easy to setup, you have to turn it on then press the on button twice to set the motion detection on, however it sets in two seconds and if you are there you set off the camera, it records for 5 minutes then shuts off forever. It only records once. I was able to set the motion detection and get away in two seconds. BUT here is the catch, you have to turn it off to save the recording, the battery dies within a couple of hours and whatever was recorded does not get saved when that happens. So unless you are Houdini and can disappear in two seconds, and know exactly when and what you want to record and shut if off manually within a couple of hours this thing is totally useless.

The lights don't blink, they either stay on or they go off.  If I hit the button over and over the lights still don't tell me what is going on.  What is wrong with putting a mode switch on it?The instructional picture is so small and low res that nothing can be identified if you didn't already know what it did.  And there are more parts in the picture than on the camera so I'm not even sure what 'model' this thing might be and why it varies from the picture.Here is another winner in the instructions:  \"push on/off to off, that's ok\".
