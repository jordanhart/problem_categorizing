It is name brand, always good, and comes with everything you need. 60ft of CCTV cabling, 1 power adapter, camera and mount, and instructions. It is the video quality I expected at 480TVL. Mine is mounted outside a window facing my front door. Its a good 100ft and you can clearly see arriving people and the night vision reached , although barely. I am surprised because it said only up to a certain range works best. It is full metal and is very tough. You can adjust it in every direction and the top cover also slides around you you can turn the lens. The night vision LEDs are undetectable which is a great feature.PROS ~- cant beat the price- all metal- includes wiring- reasonable video quality- undetectable night visionCONS ~- no audio- not HD (not like its supposed to be)I WOULD highly recommend this product to all others, friends, and family.", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Price vs quality", "Author": "Heath B.", "ReviewID": "RC0ZRI3TF9HKX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Impressed for the application.

This camera works as advertised but I would of liked to have seen a slightly better image quality.  Cable run to DVR is only 25 feet and I replaced cables and changed channels signal was coming in on, but still didn't get crisp image I was hoping for.

Night vision clarity is sharper than I expected. Day sharpness at 480 TVL is not as sharp as my other cameras at 420 TVL. Color accuracy is a bit off and hard to correct but I can live with that. Transition from day to night modes is very good. I mounted this in a metal box for weather protection and the slide hood serves well to keep the sun off the lens. The provided 100' cable attenuated the signal a bit so I replaced it with a RG59 that was on hand and that improved the image.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "These cameras do everything they promised.", "Author": "Stacy Byce", "ReviewID": "R1JBSI71GSHHEW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was an easy set up.
