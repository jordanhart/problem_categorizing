(Pan-Tilt-NO Zoom)", "Author": "txtmblweed", "ReviewID": "R44FCB605I52", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought two of these cameras to monitor my isolated rural home and immediate area.  first of all, I've been installing CCTV cameras and security systems for 30 years, I'm a retired Army colonel.  Yes, the instructions were skimpy, but real men don't need no steenkin' directions!  I had both cameras setup and viewable from anywhere in the world--in just 12 minutes!  Total cost for both cameras was just under $100!  I hardwired them both into my ethernet network, set them for fixed IP address assignments.  I then set the router to port forward their addresses, and presto!  Instant password protected viewing from my smart phone or any web browser anywhere in the world.  Night time IR viewing is terrific out to about 30 feet, B&W; in IR mode of course, excellent color in daylight.Plus, its motion detection automatically sends about five photos, upon the setable alarm, to my gmail account!  Should someone break into my home and steal my computers, the photos of the idiots are safe up on my gmail email account!  I do have one local PC set to accept and store alarm videos (10 second clips in AVI format with sound!).Yes, I have already recommended these cameras to my friends and business associates--and they've bought a half dozen so far!", "Date": "January 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera, not so great instructions!", "Author": "b. dot", "ReviewID": "R3ISPWXENPWZJ2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The instructions for setting up the camera weren't the clearest. But once when I got the camera up and running 100% it is AMAZING, especially how it can email pics after the camera senses motion.1. I would recommend using the install instructions from FOSCAM.. found here: [...] It just seems to be more clear.2. Set your bookmarks (favorites) on your browser to the external ip after setting up port forwarding and figuring your non-local IP address (not the one that starts with 192..).

I could've done what my ex SIL did by spending a fortune to have a security system installed in their home with a camera in the baby's room. But who wants to spent that kind of money?I came across the idea of using an IP camera specifically for this purpose. After looking to see what was cheap and available, I settled on the EasyN brand of cameras. I am not a computer novice by any means but neither am I a networking guru. I bought this brand because it was inexpensive, there was a ton of support available on their website and, if I failed at networking the camera myself, I had the option of paying an extra $29.00 for a networking pro to help me.I got the package, opened the box, started hooking up cable and gritted my teeth for what I thought was going to be at least a half day struggle because of all the reviews I had read about this camera. I was very pleasantly surprised. I had it done within the hour. And the only reason it took so long was because I read through all the tutorials on the EasyN website just to make sure I was getting it right the first time.The camera works perfectly! It pans and tilts and there is audio.  But what's not so great is the interference on the audio from my wireless network. I read that can be fixed by using a wired connection. But that wasn't an option for me as my baby's room is way down the hall from mine. The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because of the GUI.  My opinion is it's just ok.  I've had it for a few weeks and still have not been able to figure out what some of the controls do nor is there documentation anywhere with instructions in english.  Because of that I only use it for administrative purposes now.  Instead, I use the camera wih Baby Monitor Foscam on all my I-devices.I am able to see my baby now from anywhere in the world that has an Internet connection. Not that I would ever use it in Timbuktu, but it's nice to be able to have that option. I am happy, my family is happy, and I even managed to impress the ex in-laws because now they can also see their grandchild from cross country anytime they want to.", "Date": "June 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "simple install", "Author": "Buyer Beware", "ReviewID": "R3DR19R3LVT46S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What the other reviewer missed in his review is that the camera has never been on your network and it needs to be to talk on it. Since you setup the camera through the network it has to have a mechanism to attach. That mechanism is dhcp and a hardwire connection. Once its setup for wifi and knows about your network and any passphrase or key it no longer needs the hardwire. These are easy to setup. Once setup the alarm features can notify you immediately of issues. Mine takes about 60 to 90 secs to email photos to my phone. Very cool. The software is a less than stellar but it works well. I'll take function over beauty on these cameras any day. Bottom line these are inexpensive for what you get and if you take the time they work effectively. Easy n has apps available on the web and they supply a disk.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "pendulum32", "ReviewID": "R172FIT9PN75HZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I say this as someone who's generally regarded in my little world to have some idea of what I'm doing with computers. The user guide is awful, but if you have some basic knowledge of networking, firewalls, and port forwarding, then this is an excellent camera for the price. If you would rather have someone hold your hand through the process, you may want to consider another model. You should also have some tolerance of less than perfect written English.I had no difficulty setting up the device. I used the CD that it came with for a small part of the initial configuration to get it on the local network, but after that, I just configured the device from the web interface because it was so much easier. The camera is still working great to this day.As a quick tip, you can turn off the blinking green light that's always on by default. Just choose \"been extinguished\" from the drop menu under PTZ Settings. I found that constantly blinking light super annoying. Sadly, I haven't found a way to turn off the infrared lights.The speaker and audio features only work in Internet Explorer with the use of an ActiveX control. If this feature is really important to you, please be aware that it does depend on IE. The device provides the following viewing modes then you connect:1. ActiveX Mode (for audio features when using Internet Explorer)2. Server Push Mode (Works well for standard viewing)3. Mobile Phone Mode (Never used this)4. iPod touch / iphone 2G, 3G, 3GS, 4 and iPad dedicated (Self-explanitory)You can even configure separate logins for multiple users with different levels of access permissions, which is definitely a plus.Video quality is fair. It's not very detailed, but it works quite well. It does what I need it to do. It's not bad, but not great either. It satisfies.I would recommend this camera to someone with some networking knowledge and who is in the market for a cheap IP camera.", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "camera", "Author": "flynoe", "ReviewID": "R3HGAWAFRSDEDS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome product but get help if you arent saavy on computers.

After reading them all, I decided to give it a chance based on below- Cost: It's one of the cheapest pan and tilt camera's with mic and speaker that you will find- Functionality: It performs the functions listed.- Display: Images are good and night vision view is acceptable.My experience.- I brought 2 cameras knowing that reliability might be an issue.- Both cameras worked well and no issues so farSetup:- It was easier than I thought. When you get the camera, connect it to local lan and perform the setup. I didn't use the built in software and connected via a web browser to configure the settings.- The reset button is at the bottom of the camera- Don't make the mistake I did and try to plug the power cord into the speaker jack :-)  - It took me a few minutes before i realized my mistake.- The wireless IP and the lan IP will be the same however the mac address is different. If you lock down your access point by mac address, make sure you unlock it first to allow access.Tips / Suggestions:- You can't disable the makers DDNS. If you do use their service, make sure you route through a different port and use storng passwords.- email alerting wasn't simple to setup. suggest you use a separate account for that if you do set it up.- Micasa vera. did't work out of the box and I am still trying to figure it out. One thing that does work is to use the /snapshot.jpg url to get an image to appear.Other:- the speaker on the camera isn't the best but everything is functionalOverall, given the cost, it is worth it. a bit of a hassle to setup but once it is working, no issues so far. I would recommend this for a low cost monitoring solution for those with some knowledge on how to setup and configure networking and systems..", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Surprising quality for the price", "Author": "T.

The picture quality actually makes me mad at my Foscam and Tenvis not having as good of quality. The mount on this camera is better then the ones on my Tenvis cameras and even better then the Foscam. The internal mic is amazing I can hear people in other rooms talking at normal volume. The speaker like all cameras of this type just plain out suck and is horrible sound quality to the point as not to bother.

I am a techie, so it was easy to set up, but the setup software isn't the best. I didn't use their DNS service and used port forwarding on my local router for outside access, so I'm can't speak to how well that works or degree of difficulty to get set up.You will need to hardware via the supplied ethernet cable to do the initial setup. Setting up Wifi was not intative, but worked without issue.The Web application works well via Internet Explorer. Remote Listening works well. I have not tried the 2-way audio. (I recently rearranged my office and have to find my microphone...)The Web app through Google and Firefox is a bit unstable and does not support any audio.The Web App via mobile browser is usable, but has even less features.The android mobile app is useless for external viewing, as it will not save cameras, nor will it allow adding a manual camera. For internal use on your local network, it's annoying but works.There are a lot of other android apps for viewing ip cameras, that will work with this camera. However, I haven't found one that has 2-way capability for this camera and there are no free apps with listen capability.Summary: If you have a little tech experience (or are willing to poke around a bit), use Internet Explorer as your browser and don't mind a slightly clunky interface this is a great camera for the money.UPDATE - Downloaded the app via the QR code on the box. Completely different app then the one in Google Play, with 2-way audio. Works well.

I researched everything on Amazon. Foscam was rated highly, and so was the EasyN for $20 less. I've only used if for a week, but so far I am very pleased. My wife raises chickens, so we wanted to be able to check on them out in the coop to make sure the foxes weren't guarding the henhouse! We can quickly check the status of water, food, and temperature. The wireless distance is about 100 feet. I changed the antenna to a +3dBi gain 8\". And I have a +9 dBi on the router. These are available from Amazon and not too expensive. The camera worked with the original short antennaThe IR lights are great for about 5-8 meters, and they are basically invisible. A slight red glow of the LEDs can be seen. The image quality is good at 640x480 max. Color is decent in daylight and of course B&W; with night vision IR's. Mechanically tracks quickly and accurately. The tracking speed is adjustable and up to to 15 preset locations can be programmed for one-click moving to a location. Setup was pretty straight forward:1) Use supplied CD or download from EasyN, the camera finder and viewer software.2) I first connected camera to router and laptop to router by cables.3) Configured the camera. It self assigned the IP address and saved it as static so its always the same. I did not select DHCP option. Once setup and viewed in the cabled mode, I removed the cable and logged in again with wireless. Worked right away.4) There are a number of options in the admin setup pages after you login using http://192.168.xxx.xxx:port, or whatever your internal network IP's are.

You can also connect anywhere using DDNS. A configuration comes with the software. And you can use any DDNS provider, such as DynDNS.orgI don't know of any cons, really.

The user interface is badly translated into multiple languages. I've used it in English Spanish and German, and I bet they translated the badly translated English to the other languages. Aesthetics aside, the user interface is robust in the features that it does provide. The camera will send you e-mail pictures when it senses motion, but you may want to put it about 12 feet back otherwise you'll see pictures and blurred images, That is to say you'll know someone came in the door for example, but they will be a blur unless you put some distance between the camera and the area you want to monitor. During live motion, performance is almost real-time on an uncongested wireless 802.11N network on 802.11 G, performance is passable when the network is uncongested.I can't find any way to record video on my Mac, and I'm not comfortable with buggy web interface Recording in Windows, which still wouldn't be Mac. I can't really endorse this product for Mac users at all unless they're very technical and have a Windows machine handy. I wouldn't recommend it for Windows users either although they at least would have recording functionality.If the manufacturer would release low-level information about the product, it could have a potential called following because of the reasons to come. If one could alter the firmware, or at the very least have a specification to build a different interface application this camera might be great for Hobby robotics.Those shortcomings aside this camera does have its strengths, the price point being the major one. South of 100 bucks, you're not going to be making your next Hollywood production on an IP cam. Nonetheless more expensive models will send you a video clip, or pictures. This camera however provides low-level input output for alarm system integration, in my case this would be useful for an Arduino robot that takes the high signal from this camera to detect motion, and sends a high signal to trigger an e-mail with pictures if some other sensor has deemed it necessary. I have yet to put this use to practical application, but I do intend to try it out and let you guys know. The web interface lets you select between active high and active low. I do intend to test and let you guys know how it works setting off an interrupt on and Arduino.For now, I'll give it three stars\u2013\u2013I like some of the features of this camera, and I like the price, but I don't like it as much as I would if the menus were translated into better English (or proper Spanish or proper German for that matter)", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Many great features at a low price.", "Author": "Jeffrey A.

(with the network cable plugged in)2. Set a static IP.3. Enable \"Using Wireless LAN\" and set your network configuration.Sounds simple enough, right? Well, the difficult part comes in because the SSID cannot include a space, number or special character, and you must be using WPA, and NOT WPA2.

When connected it feels as though it will come unplugged easily.  Poor fit and finish.Next, I have it setup and am trying to record for the first time.  I am managing the camera in my Web browser and click the Record button.  I am prompted to specify the location and name of the file.  I accept the defaults (the Documents folder, with a defaulted name).  I let it record for a few minutes and then click the Record button again (presumably to stop the recording process).  When I look for the file, it's just not there.  So I click Record again and it shows me the *previous* file name in the Documents folder -- like that file is there.  I try to right-click and copy that file, then paste it somewhere else, but when I do I get a Windows error saying that the file no longer exists.  Somehow the dialog box things it does.  So I try the recording process again with the same result.  No dice.  Over and over again, in different locations from different computers, no dice.  I have no resolution at the moment.I then tried to update the firmware and cannot find a firmware update file for this camera.  At one point I am redirected to the Foscam support site, and the model numbers and firmware update numbers sent to me in an e-mail (after registering on that site) don't match my camera.  I am still unsure how to obtain a firmware update file, or if that will fix the recording problem.The tech support Chat feature is offline.

If I am wrong, somebody please tell me and post a tutorial showing us Mac users the way. I read all the most current posts and no one has yet  explained a way to get it working. I already spent all day with it and only got it to work wired on my in-house wifi. Port forwarding on a Mac is a mystery (some of you know what i'm talking about).
