I saw all of the videos and big talk about how great this product is.  So far I have not discovered ANY hidden cameras, not even at the mall, and you know that they are there.  I wish I had returned it, but like an idiot, I remained hopeful that it would work.  I should report the company who makes it to Ripoff reports so that they stop exploiting customers. From the few reviews that I've read, I think it only picks up dinky camera surveillance, if any at all.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B007A2UDA8"}}
