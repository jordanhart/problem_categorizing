Big mistake since you can only view the camera using the Internet Explorer browser.  Which means all of you Mac owners are out of luck, as are users of Firefox or ChromeEven attempting to use IE based add ons will not work.  If you are away from the location where you installed the camera you cannot view it even in Internet Explorer since you get a error message \" Install Viewer Software\" (active X) which is impossible since even the Panasonic web site does not have an install program available at the Network Camera support web sitePanasonic admits that it is a problem and via email they responded with:\" Dear Valued Customer,Thank you for your inquiry. I apologize for the inconvenience this may cause but there is currently a compatibility issue with other browsers and we are working on resolving it. Again I send my sincerest apologies for any inconvenience. Feel free to contact us at anytime for updates to the current situation.\"", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "It would have been nice to know", "Author": "mitch", "ReviewID": "R2A4MZHKGXP1XV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have a lot of experience with network video cameras.  You will notice in the pictures that they do not show a power cord.  One would reasonably think that this would mean that you do not need power AT THE CAMERA, which most of the time is hard to do.  Many of the other Panasonic cameras pull the over the network cable.  This one, in spite of the fact that it does not say or show it anywhere (do you see a picture of the back where the power cord goes - gee, some how they didn't think that was important) does require power at the camera.
