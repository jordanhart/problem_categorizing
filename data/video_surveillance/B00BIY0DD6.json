{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Decent camera, Annoyingly bright LED", "Author": "Daniel Miller", "ReviewID": "R2ZFZP1F3QMFJ5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have this camera as part of the UBW2101C system, and it has been a great way to keep tabs on the little one. The low-light \"night vision\" performance is great, since we have blackout shades in the nursery.The irritating part is the blue LED connection indicator. There are 3 LEDs on the front of the camera: a green \"power\" indicator that is decently bright (enough to navigate the room in the dark), a red \"battery low\" indicator, and a blue \"connection\" indicator that is bright enough to throw shadows on the wall, and almost enough to read by. This LED lights up when the monitor is turned on. I had to cover it with multiple layers of tape to keep it from shining so brightly.", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BIY0DD6"}}
