Good addition to the overall security system. I definitely recommend adding a sign that informs people of the camera's presence. It looks real and provides an excellent visible warning with the blinking red light. I would highly recommend this unit for anyone not wanting to invest in a real unit and save some money.", "Date": "October 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Gets the job done!!", "Author": "vwbugman", "ReviewID": "RXFTUOBIHG4TD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Totally gets the job done. Just make sure that when you mount it to something that you put a wire coming out from the camera, otherwise, people that are smart will figure it out. The red light has been blinking for over a month and haven't had to change the battery. It definitely makes people think twice before trying to break in.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Missing Parts,Dome,Nuts?", "Author": "Nor'easter", "ReviewID": "R1MKS8271N9DLA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The camera looks very real however when you get one that has no dome,nuts,missing parts it's very disappointing.
