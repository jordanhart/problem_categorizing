Dark room, then room lights on.> The black target left of the clock is a 6 inch diameter bull's-eye for pellet pistols.> For detail note the small tassel on the right door handle in the 7 feet / lights on version.Thanks to Nick (the seller) for his helpful advice in making this video.============= ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS =============I decided to buy one after seeing the quick response, by the seller, with regard to the individual that had a problem.Item arrived quickly - ahead of Amazon's estimate - which impressed me as we are on opposite sides of the USA.The other reviews here are positive but brief.  I want to add detail.  It really IS a sweet little item.I've tried a number of these for office security and MANY are JUNK.  Go ahead, check my other product reviews.  It's a relief to find one the seller stands behind.  Now I do also.1.  The unit fits in the palm of your hand.  It is a nice travel clock.  LED display is not too bright.  Tiny and easy to pack.  Discrete.UPDATE:  If you find the display too bright as a nightstand clock, use a screen protector for a cellphone.  For $2 the \"High Quality Privacy Screen Protector Verizon BlackBerry Tour 9630 Sprint\" (Amazon) covered (and dimmed) the screen but did not block the cam so you won't have to move the protector in the AM for security \"duty\".2.  The AC adaptor is both 110V and 240V - THANK YOU! - so you can use it in Europe / China / etc - outside the USA.  My Sonicare toothbrush can't do that.  International AC adaptors are a must in my opinion.  Travelers:  The cord is about 2 feet.  See seller comment to this review for longer cord options.  Note that it does have a USA plug so for China/Europe you'll need plug adaptors - but you do NOT need a voltage change.3.  VIDEO: I intend to use this as a security cam in my hotel room as I travel often for business.  A little extra \"peace of mind\".You can choose 320x240 or 640x480 for video resolution. These choices are pretty standard for security cams.  I set it to 640x480 and \"high\" quality.  Looks NICE!!!  Obviously, more quality image means more memory used.  Follow the seller guide (included - see item 4).BIG PLUS... the IR LED lighting is 940 nm!  Who cares?  940nm is invisible to the eye.  Many cams use lower nanometer levels which glow RED - the universal signal that you are recording.  I viewed THIS item with another IR camera and only then did I confirm the lighting was \"on\".  Nice!NOTE:  See the first comment to this review, from Nick (the seller), regarding the amount of video time per gigabyte of memory.4.  The instructions included are TINY - but the seller forwards you a LARGE size version PLUS a two-page \"get started\" guide.  I was functioning in under 10 minutes.  Follow the seller's guide step-by-step.  Honestly, if you have a micro SD card reader you are ready to go in no time at all.  No software necessary.  There is a micro DVD included - with English User's Manual, video example, etc - but I found the seller doc more useful.5.  When you check your micro SD card you will see FOUR folders have been added - Music, Pictures, Rec, VideoAny use of the cam goes into the \"Rec\" folder (there is another \"video\" folder in \"Rec\").  Why mention this?  Because it really IS a clock/radio/MP3 player combination.  I put a set of songs into the \"Music\" folder and it plays them well.  Sound is not bad - considering it's so small.  It will also auto advance to the next song.  I'm listening to it now.  If you have an iPhone or iPod you might not use it - but then an iPhone doesn't have night vision.6.  Mine is silver - as in the first photo above (detail page).  Some of the photos show other colors.  I'm happy with silver.  I think that is the default.  Contact the seller if you have a question.7.  Travelers... it has a small pull-string sack to carry it.  That will help protect it - and the accessories - in your luggage.***** The clock has no alarm *****  But it has so many other features (cam, true IR, radio, mp3 player, etc) the lack of alarm is not a deal breaker (for me).------------Bottom line:  The item is impressive.  Make sure you're buying from onlineenterprises888.  Don't know him. Not connected in any way.  But I have to admit the item and the service make the purchase risk free.That's how it should be.  Thanks!!.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Update-Admissable in court & Success!", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R2ZFE6YZIN2GBN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to say I too bought this because of the great reviews on the seller onlineenterprises888 and the great reviews on his help and support. I knew I needed some kind of nannycam being in a certain family situation where I need proof of what is actually happening. I must say without his YouTube video and his instructions and other reviewers instructions, I would not have been able to do this. Everyone helped with what to buy to make this work right away so I ordered the camera, the 32 scan disk and the privacy screen. So there everything was, just sitting in the box for a few days, with me looking at it sideways every once and awhile, saying I have to set this up. Tomorrow the family member is coming over so I said ok, I will have to try & set this up today even though I am not too good at setting up these types of things. But after watching the video and pausing it often so I could keep up or rewinding it & watching parts agsin, I did it. Eureka! It works! I have it set up in the living room under the lamp so it just looks like a digital clock. I will update this post after tomorrow's visit by my Bipolar family member when I see how well it recorded his visit. Stay tuned....Oh, also I asked onlineenterprises888 a question here on the question and answer section and he answered right away. Very impressive, Thank you!*************************************************************************************OK, now for the update, of course he didn't come the next day, he didn't come til Sunday. The camera caught everything. After viewing it & listening to it, everyone now saw & heard his actual behavior and can't believe the way he talks to me. Everyone now says I need to get a restraining order against him. I had told him I had a nannycam before he came and reminded him I had a nannycam recording all of this and he said if he finds it he will smash it. You could see him looking around for it but he never noticed this clock. This one recording was worth the cost of the camera to me. Nobody would believe me before. I even played it for his mother up north and she could hear it fine over the phone. This is a great product! Not to mention a great seller! At first, I couldn't get the audio to play when I plugged the device on the computer and was so disappointed, then I went to the questions & answers on this page and followed the suggestions. It played audio & video fine on the actual device, it was my computer that needed the VLC media player free download for windows to play the audio & video, and it now plays great on the computer! !******************************************************************************************OK, for the latest update, so I filed the temporary restraining order and we had court today for the final hearing/injunction. I took the camera into court & the judge allowed the video recording into evidence and had me play the recording right there in the courtroom. The audio was fantastic. They were all impressed that it was a stand alone device. I set it up on the table that I was sitting at for the Petitioner and everyone was able to hear everything even though the judge was about 15 feet away sitting high up on the bench and the court reporter was sitting next to him. The video was too small of course for them to see from that far but they didn't need to see it anyway, all they had to do was listen to the verbal violence that was going on. Even the defendant could hear it across the room at his table.After listening to the recording, the judge granted me the final injuntion. I am so impressed with this device and that the legal system here in Florida allows this as evidence and am so impressed that it worked so well as a stand alone device - no need for computers, no need for any cords or even a power source. It ran off it's own battery in the courtroom. This has been the best money I have ever spent! No one can fully appreciate what you can only describe, hearing it for their selves, what really happened, allows them to understand what you are going through and what the true experience entailed. I urge anyone in a similar situation to get this camera, the judge was denying all other injunctions today but this camera showed the court the proof that I needed this injunction and what could the defendant say in his defense? This was better than a person as a witness. The court had no need to doubt the veracity of this evidence, the court was able to make their decision based on the actions of the defendant which they could hear for themselves!*********************************************************************************", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "No able to achieve the intended result", "Author": "berthan", "ReviewID": "RDTK4P6YJRU7Y", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have no prior experience with spy camera and cannot give a fair comparison with other similar product. My comments are based purely on my intended usage. I suspect my domestic help is stealing items from us; based on the good reviews here, I brought 2 of it. However, the following are my feedback:Good:1. Reliable. It can record as promised2. Hidden its true purpose quite well; you don't suspect it is a spy cam.3. Has a good sound quality (why? I need good recording functions .. not good sound quality)Not so good:1. Very narrow angle of view.(45degree or less) - In a normal size bedroom. you probably need 2 or 3 of these to cover all corners.2. Low quality video, especially in low light condition.3. when recording, it can only function the dual role of a clock. you can't record while it functions as a radio (my domestic helper switch it to radio and the recording stops)4. NO motion detection alert. So you have to review all recordings.I set to 1 hour recording per file (max) and I need 2 of these to just cover 80% of the room. Without motion detection, It means that I need to review 20+ recording files after a long work day. It is just too time consuming. In one of these heap of files, I saw some suspicious activities. However, the recording is so poor that I cannot draw a conclusion.It is too time consuming so I am still looking for a better alternative.", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works for me.", "Author": "Robert D.

It works reliably! This is something I can't say about the majority of Chinese-made miniature camera equipment. I had a LawMate 500 pocket DVR (was about $400 nback in the day) -which self-destructed and became useless after a couple of years of use... I recently had a \"Spy Pen\" which worked once then self-destructed, useless.This little Mini Clock Radio actually works, and the display screen will work to review the video it takes.2.

Some covert nanny-cams are invisible, hiding in clocks or teddy-bears, but this one hides by being obvoiusly 'there'.3. The thing actually sounds pretty good as a powered extension speaker. Surprisingly good, actually, as an iPod speaker.4. As a security recorder, I'm able to get just over 24 hours' recording time on a class-10 Adata micro-SD at \"full\" resolution and image size. Under most circumstances this will be sufficient to transfer the incriminating video before the unit records over the starting point. There is no start and end-timer that I could see. It's either recording all the time, or it isn't.On the down side:-I had a hard time getting it to play videos recorded on other equipment. I tried various compression schemes and formats, and results were usually \"can't play video\" or some such message. That's OK because it as not purchased to BE an entertainment device, but it would be good to be able to play somthing in order to show people how it was a \"normal\" media player and establish a cover story for the device.-Although it records well onto a 16-Gig card, if I try to format the card in the device it errors out, saying. \"no card found\", yet it is in the slot and plays video. The onboard OS was probably set up for an 8-gig card.There is actually no alarm-clock function- it has a clock, and ostensibly a radio in it (though I couldn' pick up any stations in the couple minutes i tried- it doesn't seem to have the ability to set an alarm time and then play media, again, another useful feature that could help establish its \"bona-fides\" to the unwitting as a plain clock radio. But oh well.As a nanny-cam, sitting on an office shelf, or on a fireplace mantle, in a kitchen, this little unit would blend right in, as a digital clock. I think for the money it's probably one of the best covert video recorders available in this price range.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Doesn't work", "Author": "EdMel", "ReviewID": "R3LC1M67FCGZMX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Received it in a timely manner but the thing doesn't work.

I travel often for work and needed something discreet for my hotel rooms as I have encountered a few unfortunate instances where things have gone missing :(. This product is amazing on so many levels. First, when it is recording, there is virtually no way for a person to tell that it is recording as there is no red light! A lot of 'spy cams' lack this feature and it completely defy's the purpose of the product. Additionally, the product also serves as an alarm clock and iPod speakers (surprisingly good quality speakers! I actually ended up preferring this to my $150 iHome - definitely wasn't expecting that!) Next, when the device is powered up, the screen reveals a variety of options (ie: radio, input, mp3, photos, video, etc) and will not show anything involving a hidden camera unless you know the code that takes you to that screen. The quality of the video produced is much better than I expected, I can clearly see everything within a 20 foot radius. I have shown all my friends and they are all so surprised at how great the product is, especially for the price!! They all want one now :) I told them to purchase from onlineenterprises as the customer service he provides is outstanding. That is one of the most important aspects that I consider when it comes to online shopping, because lets face it: products break and things go wrong and it all comes down to how the emphasis the seller places on customer service (which this seller definitely has). This seller also includes a 1 year warranty with the product which definitely provided a piece of mind for me.

From my experience so far I would recommend it - here is some (hopefully) relevant info about this clock/camera:- unit is small, but feels pretty sturdy and well-crafted- I leave it plugged into an outlet - the rechargeable battery alone lasts 4 hours when recording (according to the seller), and about a day without recording (according to me)- get a USB extension cable - the USB cord supplied does not reach an outlet close to the ground if the clock is on a table- video resolution can be set to 640 x 480; out of the box it was 320 x 240- video settings (resolution, video quality, night mode, etc) can be changed when you are in recording mode, and go to <monitor settings> using the volume forward or reverse buttons (thanks to Inspector Gadget for mentioning this in his review!)- out of the box, night vision is weak - can be improved by going into <monitor settings> and set <DV night mode> to \"on\"; it was \"off\" out of the box, even though it still had some IR recording capabilities (? - not sure why) - anyway, with <DV night mode> on, you get an OK-ish quality 6-7 feet range in a completely dark room- Mini SD card that comes with the package deal is a class 4 card- out of the box it records 30 min clips, each clip is approx. 30-50 MB in size (for 320x240) or 200-300MB (for 640x480 in high quality) - so for an overnight recording, you would find 20+ clips, each 30 min long, in the morning (video clip length can be changed in <monitor settings> to either 10min, 30min, or 1hr)- this also implies that you get about 15 days of continuous recording on a 16GB card on the lowest 320x240 setting; on the better 640x480 setting, your 16GB card is filled up after about 3 days.- MAC users: this unit gives me a weird problem: when I connect it directly via USB, it keeps mounting multiple desktop icons (and by that I mean many, i.e. >10, and just keeps going). Somewhat annoying, so I just pop out the SD card, put it into an adapter and put that in my iMac. Takes 5 seconds and works nicely.

First of all, this unit LOOKS newer, the buttons are MUCH easier to press (it was almost impossible on my first unit to quickly work through the menu and settings, even after I re-assembled the outer casing after the sd card fiasco). Also, the software seems to be newer and the recordings themselves are much clearer. I am hoping there are no freezing or overheating issues with this new unit, and the physical differences themselves show this unit to be far superior to the previous one.

The wall charger is not very energy efficient as well. i replaced it immediately, you should do so as well.2) Length of the USB cord : its also white and is only 2 foot long. It works \"well\" if the clock is in a night stand beside the bed with a plug right behind it. if not,your best bet is to look for an old cell phone charger, and use the usb cable only when connecting to the PC.3) Controls and quick start guide : Even if Nick ( salesperson ) has bent-over backwards explaining how to properly use all the features of this machine, to the extent to even translate the Chinese version of the manual and have it in a pdf file, still does not change the fact that the controls are not very intuitive. Eventually you'll learn everything you need to make it work.4) Radio : This feature is listed in the machine, and you can select it. yet all you hear is static. Reason behind why, is probably because it needs an antenna, and it uses the earphones that it brings as an antenna, but if it got such great speakers why not include a retractable antenna is anyone guess.  I haven't found a way to make the radio work. but since that not the reason why i bought it, I'm not too upset about it.5) Field of vision and sound quality : You've probably seen nick's videos on YouTube and if you haven't you should do that now. The field of vision on this device is pretty narrow, specially when in totally dark environments. My suggestion is to point towards a door as people will be seen coming in and out of it and you'll get a better image of whom you are dealing with. Sound quality is superb, absolutely no complains there, it doesn't have noise canceling mic, but for the price, the sound cannot be better. for audiophile it may be terrible and full of noise, but for a regular person, you can hear crystal clear a conversation taking place in that room A+6) Packaging and product construction : This is where this machine shines. The product itself is very sturdy for its size, it fit in the palm of your hands, yet its a little bulky and pretty well made. Hands down, you can probably drop it a few times and won't make a dent, yet i don't recommend it, as it got an LED screen.In spite of all those pesky things, this clock/hidden camera works very well, and most people won't look at it twice even if you have a bunch of them spread out the house.i took one star cause they need to change a little bit , improve the cable, charger quality, control and quick start guide. other than that (points 1-4) is a flawless design.", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Happy!", "Author": "charizma", "ReviewID": "R35HMIBSD9X87V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this as a nanny cam, just want to make sure that babysitters are giving my child the best care, although, I know that they are the nicest and trusted people around here for babysitters.

I only bought it to record any intruders if a breakin occurs at our home and for this it should be very capable. I'll update the rating if this unit holds up for at least a year and doesn't have any major problems. I'd recommend putting the disk in a computer and printing out directions that are large enough to read as the booklet that comes with it is worthless . Also onlineenterprises888 is the company to buy from as they will provide a more detailed written instructions plus they have a youtube video to pick up pointers. Finally make sure you know how to get into and out of a recording session correctly as pushing too many buttons can lock up the unit and then you'll have a time of geting it back to start. Overall it may be a four and maybe a five but time will tell if it's durable. It is a sweet little device that video quality is great, just set record in continue mode and review if a breakin or if using it to catch a thief or child abuser. Still playing with very low light settings also.  Been looking a long time and this is a great unit for the money.UPDATE of REVIEW was that after four months of use the camera/ video recording portion of the device is not functioning so this may wind up to be an expensive piece of junk.

It's a problem I've simply ignored for the last 9 months without complaining because it still did the job, but recently I started caring when I noticed in other example videos they didn't have the same issue.The problem is, the colors are screwed up. For example, when recording a person, the hair is almost always a pinkish blue (regardless of their actual hair color). The clothing is usually a pinkish blue when it's not that color at all in real life. Basically, the video is crystal clear, but the colors are jacked up, and after hours of playing with and experimenting with the settings, it's stayed the same with no success at fixing it. I would have contacted the seller, Nick, directly instead of writing this review, but I could find NO way to contact the seller since I guess after 9 months it's too late.

Some had minor problems but most seemed satisfied so I ordered one.  I'll start with the pros.The exterior quality of the unit seems quite good and is nice looking.  The display is nice and sharp.  I didn't receive the large print instructions but I was able to figure everything out with minimal effort.  I purchased a 32G sd card and had all the settings done and recording within about 15 minutes.  The day light recording quality on High and 640X480 resolution is amazingly good and sharp.  I would guesstimate that at a distance of 8 feet that the width of the capture area is also about 8 feet.  For my use, I found this acceptable.  Again, this is under light conditions.  See cons for recording in the dark.  I like the fact that I can turn off the clock display while recording.  This makes it blend in easily as just some little gadget sitting on a desk or thrown in with a box of other electronics and doesn't draw attention to itself even as a clock, especially in a dark room.  If anyone were to ask, I could say it's a little MP3 player or powered speakers and nobody would think anything else about it.  Viewing the videos on my laptop is a breeze and was as expected.  Put the microSD into the adapter, plug it in and the window opens asking me what I want to do.  Select open folder to view files and everything is in the folder.  No problem.  I do wish the FPS was a little higher so that playback was smoother but it's  decent.  Audio recording is good quality.  I don't know about catching voices with background noises but I found it to be pretty much like normal hearing in a quiet room.  I would expect if you can hear and understand someone talking  over any background sounds from 12 feet away, that's what you'll hear on the recording.  I did hear some electronic interference that was not from anything present in the room but I had no problems understanding what was being said.  I haven't tested the audio at any longer distances than about 12 feet so I can't comment beyond that.Now for some cons and some problems that will cause me to return it.The only function outside of using it for video and audio recording that I tested was the FM radio function.  I live in a large metro area with MANY strong FM stations.  I couldn't pick up a single one.  NOT one!  I actually expected all the functions to work correctly as advertised, even if the main purpose is for discreet audio and video recording.Next is the EXTREMELY short 2 foot long power chord.  Unless you have an outlet within 2' of the unit, order or purchase a longer chord.  The chord is useless.  Along with the chord is the power supply that plugs into the wall.  It has a VERY bright red LED that causes the whole power supply to glow red and lights up a big area!  As I said, it's VERY bright!  Even if you turn off the display on the unit, with the power supply only 2 feet away, it is not discrete at all and will have everyone trying to figure out what the bright red light is in a dark room.  If I were to keep the unit, I would immediately go out and buy a power supply and longer chord.  This alone destroys the idea of it being discrete.No alarm clock.  When I was thinking about ordering it, I thought that it was strange to sell something that can operate as a clock/\"radio\" but doesn't have an alarm clock.  I went ahead and ordered it not fully thinking it through.  Here is the dilemma, If I travel with the wife, I can't justify plugging the thing in in a hotel room if I can't set an alarm on it.  She would be wondering what I need a clock for that doesn't have an alarm and I don't intend to tell her it's a video recorder.  If you set it in a bedroom with the clock display on, someone will try to set it as an alarm.  Who would buy and set out an LED clock that doesn't have an alarm function?  Again, makes no sense.  For some, it may not matter but it's something you might want to consider.The blue LED in the base.  Someone obviously did not think this one through.  If you have the clock display on, the blue LED in the base isn't a problem but what was the point of even putting one in there???  If you turn the clock display off, you still have this blue LED glowing that makes it obvious that the unit is powered up and draws attention to it in a dark room.  As others have suggested, you can cover it with tape or take the base off and pry the LED off the circuit board.  I don't know why I should even have to consider doing either of those things but if I kept the unit, that blue LED would go away, one way or another.For the cons listed up to this point, I would still keep the unit and simply make the changes and modifications I listed and overlook the alarm and radio issues.  I did buy it mainly for video and audio recording.  The reasons I have to return it are because two items are defective.The battery won't charge.  While I have read that the battery might only last a couple of hours, for most of my uses that would be acceptable but it won't charge at all.  If I left it plugged in in the same location all the time, it wouldn't matter but if you unplug it to move it, you lose all the clock settings which is also tied to the date/time stamp on the recordings.  That's a pain to have to reset it after I move it and I do want to use it from time to time on battery and with the clock display on.IR LED's.  I tested out the night recording mode in a room.  First with a lamp on and then in total darkness.  I set the LED's to  be on and Night Recording mode to on.  With the lamp on, the recording was grainy beyond about 8 feet.  Anything in a shadow was virtually invisible.  If I was fully exposed to the light, I could Irecognize my face up to the distance of the room, about 12 feet.  Not great but ok.  Next, total darkness.  The LED's do not cast light the full width or height of what the lens is capable of viewing.  I would say maybe more like 5 feet wide at the available 8 feet wide of the lens at a distance of 10 feet.  Beyond about 3 feet wide, the LED's don't cast enough light to make out much of anything.  This makes pointing the lens at exactly what you want to capture very precise or you won't see much of anything.  In my case, putting the camera no more than 5' away from the point I want to capture, at about the same level as the capture point and only getting a decent view of  about 3 feet high and 3 feet wide.  That is not going to work for me at all.  After reading the reviews and watching the sample video, I had to question the LEDS on my unit.  Using the camera on my phone, I looked at the front of the unit to see if the LEDs were in fact working properly.  They are on the left side of the unit and are grouped into three pairs, one pair above the next.  Sure enough, the pair in the middle are out.  It is very possible that with ALL of the LEDs working, there would be an improvement, but I have to question how much.  The main reason I share this is for others who may be wondering about the LEDs and not seeing well  or suddenly have a reduction in night viewing.  It may be your LEDs are not all working and it's easy to check them.I give total kudo's to the seller for his prompt responses and answering questions.  He seems very motivated and honest about his products and willing to help his customers.  I would give him and his business 5 stars.  However, I do wish that all the units were tested and checked before shipping.  Seeing that the LEDs and the battery wasn't charging would have been an easy catch.  Now I have to return the unit which will cost me money in the extra shipping I paid to receive the unit and the time to box it up and send it back for a refund.  I won't ask for an exchange because I am concerned the replacement unit might also have issues.  I have read reviews where a replacement unit also did not work properly.  I also have to question how well the unit will actually record in a dark environment even with all of the LEDs all working.

You would then have to turn the device on and off, then it would do the same thing - work for 30 seconds, then shut off - the screen still showed the music playing, but no sound came out. Also, video would record, but even with the sound setting ON, the videos recorded no sound. Also, I would never use this as a hidden camera, given that it's obvious that it is a recording device, obvious camera on the front, obvious recording dot on the screen at all times when recording, and if you forget to exit out of the \"secret\" screen, the next time you go to use the music or anything, it goes right to the secret screen, not the regular screen. The video is decent, as long as the subject matter is relatively still. My cat was getting sick and I suspected she was drinking toilet water, and this caught her in the act! But that was about all - a blurry fuzz ball on screen - since she was moving around so much - and the night mode didn't work well - you can still kind of tell, but it's only a center circle of vision, the corners all remain dark, maybe that's inevitable. No motion-activated video mode... Also, very expensive. I returned mine. Also, it was missing the cord that connects the device to the wall outlet, luckily I was able to get one on my own, and amazon is great with all of my concerns and questions. The seller also tried to be helpful, but it's just a faulty item, as I see many others have also experienced. I wouldn't recommend this unless you have time and possibly money to waste on hoping you get one that works and stays functional.

I consider that a plus as it reduces the volume in my suitcase. It is pretty, looks good and feels solid and heavy. The speakers occupy both sides and the screen uses almost the entire face of the clock. It came up with a mini DVD, headphones, USB cable to connect it to the computer and USB head to power it, as well as a small instruction booklet. So far, so good.The print is tiny, much like the one in a medicine bottle. I had trouble reading it even with a magnifying glass. A scanned image at high resolution and then enlarged solved this issue. I had trouble following them as they are brief, unclear, definitely not well written. I decided to try the DVD, expecting a step by step video. I inserted it in my laptop and it did not recognize it, not even after several attempts.I turned it on to attempt to discover its capabilities on my own and see it in action. To avoid wearing down the battery, I tried to plug it in. The USB plug is not a match for the slot!!! It is larger! Trying to avoid a return, I decided to take it to an electronics store and purchase a cable that would fit. The salesperson brought the appropriate cable, looked again at the slot and told me that it was misaligned. I guess that while packing, someone tried to make it fit, couldn't but packed it anyway and left the product damaged. So much for quality control.I am now overseas with a device that I cannot charge and for which I do not know how to use. Returning it from abroad is expensive and cumbersome and even if I got a replacement I am not sure if I could learn how to use it. I just hope the mini DVD supplies that information in a clear manner. I will take the DVD to a computer store to see if they can extract the information and the product to an electronic store repair to have the slot repaired and the proper cable.

I now have to remove the \"Pros\" segment from my first review because of my experience since. The Pros was its multi-features: MP3, camera, vd and audio record, and a clock; and good camera resolution; however, all things considered, this is a compiled flop for an $80 item. Every time I look at this item, it reminds me to ask myself, \"When will it break?\" Well, from a usage stand-point, it just broke. I was sold on some amazing 5 star \"in your dreams\" reviews; NOW, I want to give others a heads up from my reality perspective. Here's what I experienced since:][The battery power ONLY on clock mode didn't last for two days after a full charge. The clock went out in about 9+ hours. You have to keep the short (2') USB plugged to a power source if you want the simple clock mode to work on an uninterupted basis, this is standard with any clock device. You *might* get 30-40 minutes (on my first full battery charge and recording time seems to drop thereonafter) of vd recording time on battery and that's not in the infrared mode which seems to reduce recording time to about 18-25 minutes. (Recording time might differ depending on the state of the generic battery that came with your unit.) The generic battery included is not a lithium battery--I assume this by its short power life (all wording on the battery is in Chinese and battery type is missing also missing in the English portion of the instruction booklet). The instruction book states the Nokia Li-on BL-5C is a compatible battery which you have to purchase separately. After the clock on battery went out, I plugged in the USB to recharge battery and for whatever reason the SD card in the shabby back slot spat out/shot out/ejected itself a few inches from the SD port! Is it suppose to do that? I doubt it, NO. $80 dollars of headache, guessing, assumptions, unpredictable behaviors, and unknowns make this item unreliable and a rip off at $80.00! Maybe, had they focused only on the vd recording feature disguised as a clock, this item could have been useful; instead, it got pare down with too much features and everything got diluted to tasteless water. I would not recommend this item except to my enemies so they would be bogged down in frustrations.][Below was part of my original review; I have removed the \"Pros\" segment, which was mainly the multi-features which turned out to be watered down additives.]Cons: It a cheaply made low quality gadget. The selection buttons are slow-responsive, not accurate, \"menu\" and \"mode\" button function overlaps in certain commands, innards look cheap (you can see some of the internal after *dropping out the battery*--the battery just sits into place, held up by an under plate of cheap clear toy quality plastic; no spring hinge and no tension holding it in place, just the cheap bottom cover. The bottom cover can easily break off if you snap the tiny thin hinges too hard or too often. If you lose the use of the bottom cover, the battery would just drop out. It is that cheap. The instruction booklet is the worst size 6 font, 2x3, 8 page booklet I've ever read (I didn't bother using it beyond the \"hold both volumes\" button down to access the *spy feature menu*); I figure everything out on my own. The electric wall adaptor is cheaply made too (the USB mates loosely with the adaptor leaving about 1/8 of the USB neck exposed and at a slant--you have to keep the item plugged to the AC/DC outlet and I can't help but wonder if the cheap USB adaptor would fry and cause a fire--I HOPE NOT--it's that cheap in quality). I'm not a package freak, beautiful packaging means more waste for landfills, but this item look like something you pick out from a pile of table want-nots off a street seller after no one bought it for a long time.

It does that every couple of months, though there is no discernible pattern of lockups, a workaround is to take the battery off with USB cable disconnected and immediately connect it back.
