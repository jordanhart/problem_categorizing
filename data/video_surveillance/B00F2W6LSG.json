The cameras are physically fairly nice.  The cases are plastic of course, but a good grade of it.  Solid and well fitted.  Connector quality is decent.  Mounts and hardware thick, solid, and powder coat finish.  The outdoor camera is well made, and by all accounts looks like it will survive pretty well outside. Big \"dongle\" with I/O's and all inside the case, weather proof gaskets. I do not know about how well it will do with extended cold, however.The 1080P image is good, you can make out details well, the 720P is expectedly about half as good, but decent, and the NC-217 is only good for near field, however it does a good job at that.  Color fidelity across the board is so-so.  The mic is really hot passband peaking around 2.5 to 4 kHz,  dropping off rapidly on either side of that.  sic: sounds like a tin can with a wire connected to another tin can for a comm path.  Night vision is better than I thought, but lacks detail from 15 feet on out.  The moon-light setting is a nice touch.  Don't expect full bandwidth high frame rate video to work very well.  It won't.  Lower your expectations a little and go with middle of the road, and you'll be fine.  Stills captures need to be set for more than one or two snaps, as the initial triggering image is just a blur.This is most of the good news.  If were not for someone else's extensive reviews on how to make the things work, and what to setup, how and why, I would have sent these back in a minute.  Actually, I do still have an RMA open for all of them, but have decided to keep them now, thanks to Mr. Hooper, can at least get basic functionality out of them.They work pretty well with the anyscene app on iphone 4S, and 3rd gen iPad.  But, you need to upgrade to firmware 5.06.  They shipped with lower rev.  The need for the up-rev is to make the added features work on the ios-7 (maybe earlier ios).  Upon uprev to 5.06, all of the additional anyscene features came to life, and worked.  Firmware upgrade has me nervous as a kitten waiting for the thing to fail and turn the camera into a brick, but it is solid.The 2d barcode setup feature to install the camera on your ios device is really cool, as they say.  That works.  Remote viewing on your ios is pretty good, as well, but expect choppy video.  The remote download for stills and video is a little dicey, but it is there, and functional all in all.Now then, to the whacky world of PC.  I needed to use the setup on PC to get the cameras set up in more detail.  The ios set-up features are good, but not the full set that the camera can perform.They need to re-write the manuals, make the camera email feature work with something other than gmail, make the camera interface with firefox or anything else besides internet explorer.  What a painful experience I had with setting up with IE.  I finally figured out a work-around to have them talk nice to firefox, and that helped a lot.  Still, some things I want to work, I cannot make it happen.  FTP for example, seems impossible.  The point of FTP being I can send stills/video to a remote server, and not to worry of the morons stealing the camera, and hence the memory card with their smiling faces on it.  email of \"alarm\" captures (meaning it detected a motion, and emails same to your Gmail) will result in a Tsunami of emails, and gmail will likely shut you off as a spammer threat.  Adjustment of the threshold and sensitivity for motion detect isn't very good.  Or, maybe it is TOO good?I give most software the \"Peoria Test\", not to slam Peoria, but some kindly Grandmother out there who purchases things software driven, and has to cope with it on her own. Unless Grandmother was one of the women of Bletchley Park, or perhaps a coder from way back, she'd just put these things in the closet.I had a heck of a time getting the configurations to work, stick and stay working.  Once I spent an afternoon tinkering, I finally got the hang of it.  You have to plan out what and how the camera is going to be tasked very carefully.  It unfortunately is not \"3 step setup\".  On the ios app, maybe; to get bare bones functionality, but beyond that have some stress pills and a good tall cuppa' coffee handy. Good news here, once you get one of them working, you can set up a slew of them.  Apparently most of them use the same UI.  The \"Camera Live\" app for PC is buggy as the dickens.  Please fix it, Trivision.  It's a good idea.Hardware [paperclip button] reset curiously is hard to implement, but soft reset in setup UI is good.  (???) Thought that would be the other way around.Hard-wired they are very reliable for connectivity, wireless, they need 4 bars at a minimum, and no more than two walls or one floor separation is about it.  Still expect dropouts stalls and restarts at that.  I thought I was all done a long time ago running cat5, sigh.I could cover a lot more here, but in the nutshell, I am just OK with them.  They will do the job, but my expectations were let down quite a lot.  If trivision is tuning into these reviews, I would like to have them contact me, These would be a pretty good buy with needed improvements to the embedded software.  BTW, the email support from them is very good.", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00F2W6LSG"}}
