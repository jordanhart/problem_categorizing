Nice thick cable however I don't know if I got a bad batch or what.  One 200 foot didn't work at all.  2 of the 3 100 foot cables will loose video if I move the cable.  They are loosing contact somewhere where the cable splits the power and bnc.  Amazon replaced the 200 foot and it works fine now.  I don't want to run any more cable and the other work ok as long as we don't move the cables.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Q-See RG-59 Cable", "Author": "T.

This is tough and can be pulled without worrying that it will break.  The extra shielding helps in case you have to run over an electrical wires (no interference).  Highly recommend over the cheap stuff they ship with the package units.  This had both the CCTV lead and the power lead, so it's a direct replacement for their other cables.  It's 100ft long vs. the 60ft cable they package, when you need that little extra distance.  They say to use a bigger power supply for the longer runs, but I have tried both with an issue.  It maybe a problem if you have mostly long runs, but with just two an split one on each supply and didn't see a problem.  FYI the reg PSU is 3amp and bigger is 5amp.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "fixed noise issues", "Author": "kevin barker", "ReviewID": "R3V9EQ96V0LZLW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "have these going into safe through two 90 degree angles through door, the original cables that came with SWANN system had bunch of noise, these work perfectly. highly recommend.", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Decent cable with a couple of issues", "Author": "She-Ra", "ReviewID": "R3JMB44FZWN4JP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The quality of the connectors are below the ones that came with my Lorex system.  The cables work, but I am a little worried about the long term performance.  Also, not shown in the picture, is that about 8 inches below the connectors is a rectangular stress relief feature molded onto the cable.  This prevents you from splitting the cable more than 8 inches, and also requires a larger hole to be drilled in the wall to pass through the cable.  In order to make do with a smaller hole I trimmed the relief block with a utility knife.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really good cable", "Author": "Ryan Peterson", "ReviewID": "RKVLHAS8529LO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "More wire than I had originally thought I needed, but it worked out well.

The shipping tracking system worked fine.  It came in a box much larger than the cable.  I needed a longer than 60' for a Q-See video surveilance installation.  Since the cable route was through a clustered crawl space with many 110vac lines about,a cable that is sturdier and shielded was chosen.  It worked fine the first time.  My order was placed with Amazon becuase Q-See was out of stock.  I read Amazon reviews and found out the cheaper Q-See cables that came with my system are only twisted pairs with no shielding.  They seem to be minimal,with fragile wire and ends, more like ear bud wire than video cable and I was afraid there would problems at the ends as I threaded them through the attic I was very gentle. They also worked fine.  I am happily surprised.
