{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome product with some connection problems that I fixed.", "Author": "Matthias Nott", "ReviewID": "RBYFQDBOZQXUA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is really an excellent camera for Baby monitoring! I give it a 4 and not a 5 since I was having significant problems with the App that's provided by BabyPing.From my perspective, BabyPing goes to great lengths in order to make the setup process as simple as possible. They do an auto detection of the camera, and once that's done, you should just expect to launch the app and immediately see what's going on with your child.Yet, the simplicity of the app seems to be its weakness: It failed to connect most of the time for me, and when I was debugging the situation, I found out several things that I did not like, like the app requesting your WPA key over the network and also no way to do a port forward so that the grand parents can view the child - and no support of more than one camera.But there's no point complaining, as the camera itself is an excellent product.Taking that into account, I have written my own app for the camera. It is on the app store. Just search for BabyPing, you'll find it next to the app from BabyPing: It is called BabyPhoneViewerFree. Once you've set up your camera with the BabyPing app, you can use my viewer to connect to (up to four) BabyPing cams, and while the original app was failing to connect most of the time, my app seems to work more reliably and instantly connects. What's more, it supports VPN and Port Forwarding use scenarios, and also some level of zoom.In addition, the app allows to connect to many other types of webcams, e.g. traditional Y-Cams.The fact that I wrote the app is not a criticism about the product BabyPing itself. It is an excellent product, and that's why I invested some time in extending it, since I think this is really worth while for many parents around this world.And since fiddling with your app to connect to the camera is really the last thing you want to do if you hear your baby crying, I went on to improve an already excellent product.", "Date": "July 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Malfunctioning Monitor, Unresponsive Customer Support", "Author": "Julie Warrender", "ReviewID": "R16WJ7B1NX789Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We had been using our monitor for about six months without issue when the audio stopped working.

It was easy to set up to the WiFi and get installed in the nursery. The thing that attracted us to this item was the fact that even though my husband is on the road every week for work, he would still be able to see the baby sleeping each night. We were able to do so by downloading the BabyPing+ app from the iTunes store. We have also set it up so that the grandparents can check in and see him sleeping as well. The good thing is that when you don't want anyone to be able to access the camera, you can shut that feature off. A plus about this product is that not just anyone can go in and see your baby in their nursery... You have to give them the access to be able to do so - that was initially a big concern for us that anyone on our WiFi network would be able to do this.I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 because of the fact that if your WiFi connection weakens there will be a lag of 5 or so seconds on the camera. This was something we had anticipated especially working through a WiFi network, so it's not a huge disappointment. Not to mention we can usually hear him anyway if we are downstairs or in our bedroom upstairs. One thing that does bother me is in regards to the BabyPing app. Since our baby sleeps through the night, I'm not constantly checking the camera, but usually at least once a night it will close out on me so that I have to go in and re-open it. It's not a huge issue, just kind of a pain.Overall, it is a good product. One thing that would make it amazing is if you could talk back to the baby through the device that is in the nursery. I would recommend this product to all the tech savvy parents out there that are looking for a convenient way to keep tabs on their baby while they are napping or sleeping.", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good WiFi Baby Monitor", "Author": "leftride", "ReviewID": "R1IXYHG3Q8B879", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using the BabyPing monitor for over a month and have been pleased with the performance.  I purchased the BabyPing for 2 reasons: 1) the BabyPing iOS app seemed to be most feature rich of other iOS Baby monitors and 2) Y-Cam, the makers of the camera have a good reputation for web cams.So far the app/camera has worked well.  I have always had a good connection, there is a slight delay of 2-3 seconds, but nothing that would ever cause an issue.  BabyPing has also been updating the app and camera firmware regularly which I appreciate.  They have added a few new features and I hope they continue to do so.The only drawbacks I have found is that there isn't an easy way to travel with this camera...it requires bringing a network cable to setup the wifi connection, would be nice if the camera could save a list of WiFi connections and the camera would connect to which ever one was available.  That way you could set it up before hand and not need the network cable.  It would also be nice to see native apps available outside of iOS, or open up the web interface.Overall I'm happy with my purchase.", "Date": "November 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it! Great camera! But maybe not for everyone.", "Author": "Liz S.", "ReviewID": "RLH4WFHTELR31", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We love BabyPing and recommend it to friends, but in ADDITION to an old fashioned audio monitor, not in place of one (which is why I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars). Not everyone will feel comfortable with the price of BabyPing plus a (basic) audio monitor, but for us it was well worth it and there are several reasons we like it much better than just having a regular video monitor like the one from Summer Infant that several of my friends with babies have. First, we have found it really helpful to be able to check in on the baby while she's at home with a grandparent or sitter. Second, we happen to have a large home and when I'm all the way down in the laundry room in the basement at the other end if the house and the audio monitor gets staticky, I love being able to just pull out my phone and use BabyPing (our wifi signal is pretty strong all over because we have repeaters so all our Tivos/Rokus/mobile devices work all over). It's also great to have when I get down there and realize I've accidentally left the audio monitor 2 floors up! And when my hands are full my cell slips in my pocket while the bulky audio monitor doesn't.  My husband and I both have the app on our iPhones and our iPads and we even have an old device that we're not using and installed it on that (without our email or other private Info/apps, but with all of daughter's music) to let sitters/grandparents use. We don't let anyone else, even grandparents, have the app on their own devices so that we have complete control over who can peek in and when - fine for my husband to check it from work and potentially see me with breastfeeding, not so fine with me for anyone else!). I read in another review that you can actually let others have the app but then turn off their ability to peek in - I didn't realize this and am planning to read the manual and investigate that!I'm not a Luddite but I'm also not a tech expert, so my thoughts on the tech aspects of BabyPing probably won't be helpful for those of you who are very tech savvy. For those of you who aren't, BabyPing was easy to set up and the app is pretty straight forward and user-friendly. To initially set up the app I think you have to have the camera's unique and lengthy code and be on the same wireless network. It took less than 5 minutes though. Sorry I can't speak more to the security, but my husband, who is far more techy than I am, did a lot of research into this (and other network cams, video monitors and audio monitors) when we were deciding on what type of monitor(s) to get and he felt that this, plus a newer/better router he got, was very secure. Not my area of expertise though, as you can probably tell from how poorly I'm able to explain it!The camera's picture quality is quite good. It has audio and video (great night vision, color when lights are on), but I think that having a traditional audio monitor is key because even though I used to leave the video on my iPad on all night, once or twice something weird happened and it turned off. I think that was a bug fixed by an app update, but still.  Also, now that DD is 1 and sleeping much longer, I usually just leave the audio monitor on and only \"tune in\" to the video when I want to see if she's crying but will resettle herself or if she's crying and standing up totally awake and needs me to intervene. But I like being able to just use my phone if we have company, etc. Also when DD and I went to visit my parents for a couple weeks, all I had to pack was the camera since obviously I'd have my phone with me. We were also glad to be able to check in on her from afar when a dear friend stayed the night with her for our 5th wedding anniversary. We didn't go far - just to a fancy hotel near by - so that we could go back home if she totally refused all bottles. We knew our friend would try not to tell us if things were going poorly so it was amazing to be able to check in for a minute and then turn it off without having to text or call at crazy hours!BabyPing has been one of our best purchases.

That being said though, this product needs a lot of time before it'll be a legitimate competitor to some of the other GHZ spectrum competition.  BabyPing is a great concept, but relies on too many other variables to offer parents the service levels needed when monitoring newborns through 12 month-olds.  Even with a new/robust router, having the unit direct connected, having up-to-date IOS versions installed AND large, high-speed bandwidth, we experience delays of up to 7 seconds.  Further, the app wasn't stable enough to keep running in the background, so we had to constantly close and open the app in order to see what was happening in our nursery.  All in all, the BabyPing camera performed as it should, but relies on too many ancillary technologies to provide the same level of service as a traditional GHZ based monitor. As a side note, we engaged repeatedly with their support, who only offer a 14-day return policy.  This doesn't really help if you've purchased this in advance of Baby's arrival, and really don't use the monitor until 2m+.  We've since replaced ours with a Levana Astra and couldn't be happier with the performance.  If you've ever sleep trained, or stressed over a little one, go with the monitor that offers consistent performance and minimal delay.

The MAC address of the first was somehow corrupted, meaning that the camera couldn't stream to the remote BabyPing+ viewing app, and the second would not work in the dark - there was an issue with the sensor that switches between the standard and infrared cameras.Clearly there are quality control issues, but I assume it's just bad luck to have two devices breakdown for such different reasons.Each time the cameras stopped functioning, I called BabyPing customer service directly (in the UK).  Both times, my initial calls were pleasant and helpful - polite, seemingly attentive and informed representatives who assured me that these were unfortunate, one off issues.  Both times, the agents immediately offered to send a replacement on an expedited basis, and arrange for a no hastle pick up of the defective device.And both times, these initial calls were followed up by radio silence and weeks of inaction.

We have a large house and traditional baby monitors don't have the range to work for us.  We have a solid, commercial grade Wi-Fi network (Cisco Aeronet) in our house that gives us full coverage through every room.  When I received the product I attempted to perform the initial setup.  The included directions are pretty sparse and very dumbed down so the setup looked like it would be easy.  I downloaded the app from the Apple app store on both my iPhone and my iPad.  After following the directions to the T the app simply could not locate the baby monitor.  Thinking that I had a bad unit I tried the second unit that I had purchased.  I tried all of the troubleshooting tips on the Baby Ping website and none worked.  I sent an e-mail to the tech support dept at Baby Pink and they took a full 3 days to get back to me.  Their only advice was to un-install the app from my iPhone / iPad and then re-install it.  After doing this and still not having any success I replied to the e-mail from tech support and I still have not heard back (that was 2 days ago).  I have decided that this product is just too unreliable to chance having it not work and ending up with an angry baby crying all night.  I am retuning the product to Amazon and will be exploring some other options.

On IO5 i had numerous issues with it not connecting to my wi-fi even though all my devices had full signal in the same room. I then change my router brand from linksys to N band belkin and had the same exact issues. i put up with it as i was not using it currently as baby was still in our room and was hoping for a app update to fix the issues which never come. the day was approaching we were gonna leave the baby in his room. I purchased the Apple airport extreme router which had less range than my Belkin N band but thought this router must have been one that the system was tested with but my signal dropped to zero bars and wouldn't even find the cam. I then went out and purchased a second airport router to increase the range and i then got 3 bars with the second router 3ft from the camera. It would then sometimes find the cam but still unreliable. I then found out after messing for 3 hours that the babyping will not connect to the extended network router which is 3ft from the babyping cam. i had to plug the router into the closer router for it to use the router with the more powerful signal. it is now connected to the closer router until the power from the babyping goes off or the router goes off so power outages will require to set it up each and every time. Now come the other problems. The IOS5 app will cut off after 30mins each and every time. we have 4 Apple devices and the ipad 1 and 3 are the only devices that stay connected. the Iphone 4 and 4s will disconnect after 30mins. even my friends iphone5 does the same thing. We updated to the IOS6 app and now more problems than before. Now the Ipads get a blank screen and they have a diagonal bar that one side is light grey and the other dark grey and the picture stops on this screen. The iphones do something different. The screens will just go blank and the sound will stop. this happens after only a couple of mins. then after about 30-50 seconds it will show the Oops we have a problem screen. I have also tried the Baby phone App which a reviewer on here wrote. I have the same shut down issues on his app as the babyping app so i guess its an issue with the cam.I would steer clear of this product until all issues have been sorted. I have over $500 in routers purchased because of this Cam and more than 18hrs of my time messing with it and the cost of the cam and it still don't work.Another warning when upgrading the App to IOS6 version of the babyping app. It has messed my wifi up and i can no longer connect to my wi-fi. i never had issues with wi-fi until the second i installed this app and now i have issues. It will disconnect my wi-fi from the phone and i have to go into settings to select the wi-fi again.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Junk!  Buyer Beware.

Instructions were pretty simple to follow for setting it up but it just did not want to connect even though I guarantee I was doing it correctly.  finally when it connected I was ready to unplug and go put it up in my child's room when it disconnected again.  when puting in wifi password again to get it to reconnect it said password was wrong.  when trying again hours later it finally took the password (same password, I promise I did not enter it in wrong).  finally got it all set up and started using it.  the night vision is not the best as its almost too bright.  honestly that would not be a big deal but it kept disconnecting and reconnecting on its own. the first couple hours it was just a few times, not too terrible.  then as time went on (24hrs) it got worse and worse and stopped reconnecting.  I currently (30hrs) still have it set up and it only works 10% of the time.  It is not the wifi connection cause we have other things on our wifi that were working just fine during this whole time.  oh and the lag.  I expected a 3 second delay for a wifi camera but sometimes the delay was as much as 10 seconds and it was not even consistent as to when it was only 3 seconds and when it was 10 seconds.  I would not recommend this camera at all.  and I never write reviews cause I don't have the time, but I want consumers to be aware of this expensive piece of crap!!!
