{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Outstanding features, attic installation and UPS power backup - here is how!", "Author": "Internet shopper \"Retired but not tired!\"", "ReviewID": "RP6X00QM7GZ9T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all the SETUP is very easy. The on screen prompts will take you though the steps.1. Install the software.2. Plug the master network adapter into the power outlet and plug the Ethernet cable into your router3. Plug the camera into power outlet and click yes to update firmware (adapters and camera).NOTE: Do not unplug the camera or the master adapter during the update.Wow that was easy. It took less than 15 minutes to get the system up and running.You can even use your neighbors WiFi signal (please ask first) - more below.PICTURE QUALITYThe picture quality is great (but not HD and not what you have come to expect from a digital camera) during daylight hours but not so great at capturing clear pictures of moving objects in total darkness. However in my case I have a flood light with motion detector that comes on when someone enters the area at night making the video bright and clear.MOTION DETECTIONWhat I like is that you can draw areas on the actual image from the video camera to trigger recording. In other words you can eliminate false recordings from cars going by or movement outside your property.You set up each camera individually providing ultimate flexibility in alerts, sensitivity and recording. In addition, once you have created a LogitechAlert account, you can select which cameras triggers an email alert.EMAIL ALERTSYou set the LogitechAlert account up from the Settings Menu (the gearwheel icon).From here you can enter several email addresses. I have mine set to send a text to my cell phone (as I don't have a smart phone with email and web access).Most cell phone providers offers an email address starting with your cell phone number that will be forwarded to you as a text message.Please look the email address up on your providers web page. I can not put them up due to Amazon posting regulations.You may get charged for each text by your cell phone provider so make sure to set the Alert Frequency and Motion Filter conservatively (from within the Settings Menu - Alerts-Advanced).As mentioned above, I have not received one false alarm although my system is still set using the default values.RECORDING WITH PC TURNED OFF - THIS IS A GREAT FEATURE.The camera(s) stores all motion triggered activity regardless if you have the PC on or off. To review all recorded activity, start the PC and click the \"Enter Playback Mode\" icon. A very intuitive calendar and timeline shows up indicating recordings. Point to a time and click on play to see the activity.UPDATE:You can review/playback history from only the dedicated PC on your network.Logitech suggests not loading the software on more than on PC on the network.If you do, you can only watch live video but review/playback will not work from the other PC's (also unexpected results may occur).NOTE: You can view the real time images from anywhere on the web with the free Logitech Web Alert Viewer. To get full control with playback via a remote PC you must purchase the Logitech Web and Mobile Commander for an annual fee* of $80 (at the time of this writing).Unless...You keep a PC turned on all the time and control it from any PC (or web enabled phone) on the web using Teamviewer or LogMeIn (both are free for private use - you can download the programs from Cnet.com). Then you can access the Logitech Alert Commander interface as you normally do from home.UPDATE 1: I am using the free version of LogMeIn and it works great. The only disadvantage is that you can not hear audio from the home computer.  But you can see the live video feed and use playback along with camera adjustments etc. Actually you can operate your home computer just as if you were sitting in front of it. You can access it from work or anywhere in the world via the internet.UPDATE 2: I have now used both remote programs for over a month. Logmein appear to be unreliable with respect to video quality. TEAMVIEWER IS THE WINNER (To get perfect video quality: select \"View\", \"Optimize Quality\" from the TeamViewer screen on the remote computer). TeamViewer will also let you transfer recorded video files (or any file for that matter) when you are away from home.Cost for leaving your home computer on all the time.The cost for a 40 Watts consumer** 24 hours per day, 365 days per year = $35/year at $0.10 per kWh.However, LogMeIn allows you to use \"Wake Up On LAN\" so you can turn your home computer on from the remote computer (Too much to cover here).*  Come on Logitech!!! Reduce it to a $50 one time fee and sell more systems to happier customers.**  One UPS manufacturer estimates 40 watts power consumption from an entry level desk top with a 20 LCD monitor. Turn the monitor off and bring the cost down even more. Also set the hard drive to turn off if not in use via Windows \"Power Options Interface\". You may also be able to set the home computer to \"Wake up on LAN\".INSTALLATION OF THE CAMERA'S POWER/DATA ADAPTER IN THE ATTICFirst of all I wanted to hide the wire to the camera.Logitech's instructions show the power/data wire going from the camera to a power outlet on the side of the house.Consequently a thief can easily unplug the camera.SolutionPull an extension cord from a power outlet in the attic (or somewhere else) and connect it to the grey power supply/adapter for the camera.IT WORKS!!!NOTE: WHATEVER YOU DO WHEN PULLING WIRES MAKE SURE THEY ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL CODES.I know Logitech Customer Service had told another reviewer \"The adapters CANNOT be installed in the attic\".Logitech may be concerned about high attic temperatures present in some climates.My attic does not get very hot; in addition I mounted the adapter just above the lower perimeter soffit vent where outside air constantly flows in.The power/data Ethernet cable to the exterior camera (mounted under the roof overhang) is now routed through the soffit to the camera adapter in the attic.Drill a 9/16\" (14 mm) hole to allow the Ethernet plug to pass through the soffit. Mount the power adapter over the soffit vent with the power cable coming out at the top as shown in Logitech's instructions.NOTE: I used a 100 foot grounded heavy duty extension cord plugged into a grounded power outlet. I don't know if using a grounded outlet and grounded extension cord matters because none of the adapters are equipped with grounded plugs. You may not need a heavy duty cord as the camera adapter uses very little power.PREVENT BLACKOUT DURING POWER OUTAGES USING A UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)I still want the surveillance system to work during power outages or if the power line to the house is cut.The Manual tell you it will not work if you use a surge protector or UPS.SolutionI already have the cable modem and the wireless router plugged into an APC BN600R Battery Backup (UPS), so all I had to do was to plug the black Logitech network adapter into the UPS and pull an extension cord from the UPS to the grey Logitech camera adapter. All the equipment is fed from a single UPS.IT WORKS!!!The disadvantage is that you have to pull extension cord(s) from the UPS to the camera adapters. In my case it was not a problem because the extension cord would drop down from the attic between the studs in one of the walls to where I have my router.I am sure you can use a higher capacity UPS as long as ALL your Logitech adapters are connected to it.WHATEVER YOU DO WHEN PULLING WIRES MAKE SURE THEY ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL CODES.SOUND/AUDIOOut of the box there was no audio from the camera.SolutionTo turn the sound on:1) Un-mute from the Command screen (slider at the right hand bottom) and2) Click on Settings (gearwheel icon) and click on the camera name (your camera(s) will be listed by the name you give them during setup \"Entry way\", \"Hall way\" etc.)Then check the box Enable Audio (after accepting the legal notice).Note: If you have more than one camera, you have to Enable Audio for each one.GOOD QUALITY PRICE RATIOOverall I will rate the Logitech 750e  a quality system for the money. As an alternative, you can purchase professional systems that will cost thousands of $ but is unlikely that they have the remote access this system has.Perhaps Logitech have \"beefed up\" the mounting hardware for the camera. My hardware is rigid and of good quality. Another reviewer had problems with the hardware.(I tightened and pre-adjusted the holder/adapter and added a drop of Locktite (blue) to the threads prior to installation. It is easier done on the ground as compared to the top of a 15 foot ladder).UPDATE: The mounting plate is covered with a rubber cover. You have to tighten the holder rod FIRMLY to the base to ensure a rigid mount (or else the camera will wiggle).Also, one of the cameras would turn freely no matter how hard the thumbscrew was tightened. It turned out that there is a phillips screw hiden inside the short rod which is being clamped by the thumbscrew assembly. The phillips screw was loose. Simply remove the thumbscrew completely to take the assembly apart. Then tighten the phillips screw and put it back together.Logitech, QA/QC you need to address this issue. This is probably why so many people are complaining about the camera mount.ALARM SYSTEM - Section added October 7, 2011Before installing the system I had tried a couple of alarm systems with wireless sensors on the windows and doors. It was a lot of work to set up and configure but I could have lived with that if it wasn't for the false alarms. THEY DROVE ME AND THE NEIGHBORS CRAZY.Now I use the Logitech camera-setup as a silent alarm system. The email/text message alert tells me if a camera detects motion and I can immediately check what is going on over the internet via my Android phone (I finally got one) or from the PC in the hotel lobby.This way you can actually watch what is going on in and around the house before calling the police.Suggestion: Add the number for the dispatcher at your local police station to your phone book. (Calling 911 from Florida will probably take too long if your house is in Maine).Here is what I have learned.A camera MAY report motion (and send an email/text message*) if the shadows from clouds etc suddenly moves across the area the camera is set to monitor. I say MAY because it very seldom happens.The solution is to exclude these window or potential \"moving shadow\" areas from the cameras trigger area(s).A camera WILL report motion if a large insect or flying leaf moves over the trigger area.  Even a small chipmunk on the ground will trigger the camera. Consequently I do not use an outside camera to send me text messages if motion is detected.When an outdoor camera is operating in night vision mode insects are attracted to it like a regular light bulb. Fortunately it is only a special type of insect that triggers my camera. It looks like a white flying spiral worm that is one to two inches long and 0.5\" in diameter (I have not observed any other type of insects trigger a camera).* Providing you have armed the system.HOW TO CONNECT WITHOUT CABLE, DSL or ADSL INTERNET SERVICE - Section added February 21, 2012We have a cabin without wired internet service and without 3G broadband signal. The good news is that my year-round neighbor has internet service and a WiFi router. The signal from the router is very weak. However I managed to get EXCELLENT signal strength using the Alfa AWUS036H 1000mW 1W 802.11b/g USB Wireless WiFi network Adapter with 5dBi Antenna and Suction cup Window Mount dock - for Wardriving & Range Extension antenna connected to the USB port on my computer.Next step was to get the signal into a router. Again, Alfa to the rescue; they make a small but very sophisticated router that connects to their antenna (or a 3G USB adapter). Alfa R36 802.11 b, g N, Repeater and Range Extender for AWUS036H can also be used as a 3G Router - Enables you to Extend to Signal that is picked up by the AWUS036H and distribute the internet to multiple Users (Desktops, Laptops, tablets, iPods or iPad...It was very simple to set up: WiFi signal from neighbor -> to Alfa Antenna -> to USB port on the R36 router -> to the black Logitech network adapter via Ethernet cable -> to PC running the Logitech software (this last step is optional).NOTE ALL COMPONENTS MUST BE POWERED DOWN AND UP AGAIN FOR THE CAMERA TO BE FOUND AND BECOME LIVE VIA THE Alert.Logitech.com website.That was easy...... and my neighbor did not have a problem sharing his WiFi signal in the spirit of neighborhood watch and safety.BONUSNow we have our own private LAN with full WiFi and internet access for all our WiFi gadgets throughout the cabin.Ever wondered how to set up a PRIVATE LAN using your neighbors WiFi signal - NOW YOU KNOW!SUMMARY- Very easy setup- Great picture quality in daylight but not in total darkness- Motion detection is very reliable- Flexible email alert settings- Workaround if you don't have a phone with email or web access- Recording with PC turned off - great feature- Workaround to avoid paying $80 per year for remote access- Attic installation of the camera's power adapter- How to connect \"Battery UPS backup\"- How to turn the sound feature on-  Using the cameras as a Security System-  Connect the system to the internet via WiFi or 3GI hope this review helps you. The system is very easy to get up and running. YOU CAN DO IT!!!Disclaimer, I am retired and do not work for or have stock in any company. I write reviews because I use them extensively myself before I make a purchasing decision.", "Date": "October 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pretty good for the most part - Updated again, see second update", "Author": "David Hilliard \"Helevitia\"", "ReviewID": "R16BHR9SPGJDDE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been waiting for an inexpensive HD security system to come out.  This system is pretty good and, for the most part, does what I want it to do.SETUP: Setup isn't too bad.  Just remember to read the directions but there are a few gotchas such as, you can't plug the camera side or the network side plugs into a power strip because of the circuitry screws up the data making it out of the power strip.  This leads to the first problem I have.  You have to use a dedicated outlet for each plug.  In my older house, plugs are few and far between.SOFTWARE: The software installation was quick and painless.  Immediately the software updated the firmware for my camera which was nice.  The software controls are OK.  It's missing some key features in my opinion.  There is no \"record\" button.  So it only records if it detects motion.  I want the ability to be able to record on demand.MOTION: You can select up to 6 zones that trigger recordings and alerts when there is movement.  The downside is, the zones are only square.  I wish you could make angles as well.  The motion is too sensitive imho.  I have it all the way down and it finally seems to be only pick up large movement.CAMERA: The camera is of very high quality.  It is all metal and it feels solid and like it will last a long time.  I was surprised on how well built it is.  It also has a microphone that works really well.  It picks up everything.  The last thing is the night vision.  It works pretty good.  The image quality is pretty good.  I give it an 8 out of 10 when looking at the picture in the software.  To my surprise, the image when viewing the videos manually are better!REMOTE VIEWING: Viewing the image on my iphone is pretty cool.  There is about a 5-10 second delay, which is to be expected. Viewing the image at [...]is decent, though you already know from the other reviews that there is no sound with remote viewing.ALERTS: The email alerts are cool but I wish they would send you a screen shot as to why there was an alert.  So imagine you get an alert, you log onto [...] or view the picture on your phone and now whatever it is that triggered the alert is gone, so you have no ideas what happened.  On top of that, the free viewing doesn't have any way to rewind to see what's going on, so you'll have to wait until you get home.  One workaround is, if you have remote software for your PC, you can remotely connect to your PC and view the software that way, but most users will have no idea how to do this.  The other alert is right on your desktop, which seems cool at first, a sound is made and then a small picture pops up.  the problem is, you can't click the picture to make it bigger, it just disappears after a few seconds.OTHER:  The cord that comes with the camera is not long enough.  I think it's 25ft.  Which is decent, but they should give you 100ft for the money that you pay.  You can buy more cord but I feel you shouldn't have to with the first camera.All in all, I like this setup though it could use some improvements here and there.  I plan to keep mine and add more cameras hoping they improve the software.UPDATE: After doing some research over the weekend, I realize how bad the Logitech software really is.  Instead I decided to go with software called, \"Blue Iris\" which is worlds better than the Logitech software in every way.  So much so, I paid $50 for it.  After that, I realized that the appeal of the Logitech camera system starts to fade since I could literally buy any camera and use it with Blue Iris.  Currently I am running Blue Iris with one Logitech 700e and my Logitech C910 HD webcam and it works flawlessly.  Admittedly it's not going to be as easy for normal folk, but for a techie like me, it's more than worth the effort.  Bottom line, if you decide to get the Logitech camera, don't waste your money on the \"System\" package and just get the camera and purchase Blue Iris instead.  Or, do what I plan to do, research similar cameras and see what my options are.BTW - If you want to just connect to your camera, download VLC player and then use the \"Advanced File Open\" menu and type \"[...]\" or \"[...]  Cheers!11/5/2011 Update:  OK, I've had the cameras for almost a year now.  I've been really happy with them.  For the price, you can't beat it.  I raised the stars back to 3.  I still ding it for a few things.  I really wish it was 30fps, but I guess it would be a lot of bandwidth over the internet, so they probably made a decision to chop it 15fps to conserve bandwidth and to save a little money on the camera side.  I still use Blue Iris for 99% of my recording(I record 24/7 for 7 days).  I actually use the email alerts with Logitech over Blue Iris since Blue Iris has a bug where it spits garbage onto the screen and falsely sets off the motion.  I mentioned in my earlier review that there are no pictures with the email alerts.  I was wrong, there is!  I have caught somebody casing my house(they ended up robbing my next door neighbors house), I caught an accident, and a couple of drug deals.  I see which critters walk around my house at night(raccoons, cats, and skunks), and catch everything from spiders to birds to every solicitor that comes to my door.  I love knowing when people are coming and going.  I see when packages are delivered and all with great clarity.  If Logitech could add 24/7 recording, diagonal blocks on the motion page and lower the price of the yearly subscription, I would give them a 5.  Anyhoo, just thought I'd post again since I felt my 2 stars were a bit low.", "Date": "January 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Quite a ride Logitech has taken us on...BUT>", "Author": "Bob J \"tarheelinva\"", "ReviewID": "R2UORDGVPPO991", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera system, six cameras total, two at a time, until I was somewhat basically satisfied with them.  Today, I'm at about 80% satisfaction rating but the first few weeks were pretty brutal.  It's a bit of a learning curve figuring out how this system works because it uses POE (power over ethernet) connects and if you run your vacuum cleaner or carpet shampoo machine, well, some of the cameras get confused and bug out.  Some will come back on after you are done, some may not.  And they definitely don't like power outages: during one ice storm here, the power flickered on and off multiple times - the cameras went out, would not come back on and ultimately I had to wait til the event was over and then unplug and replug every unit (some of which were not very convenient to reach in 10 degree weather, I might add).  In other power failures, where the power simply goes out and stays out, they have all managed to recover on their own (after the new update which may have improved that problem.) Flickering power is not good however.The micro-SD cards are a royal pain - and should NEVER have been mounted in the camera itself - way too inconvenient to reach if you mount them \"out of reach\" from others (most of us would, right?)  Whoever thought that up was not an end-user, that's for sure.  They should be in the power supply, which hopefully would be easier to reach and certainly easier to work on (these are very tiny cards.)  I see their purpose and that's great BUT perhaps a standard card would  have been smarter and easier to work with.The software is not ready for prime time at all - again, whoever designed this software has apparently no experience with security camera systems. YES, the software looks nice and the clarity (daytime) is pretty awesome compared to most systems but this is not most systems - in fact it costs about double or even triple what most of the standard run of the mill systems costs, so I would expect better clarity.  And night vision, well, it's pitiful - like looking at reverse negatives and no adjustments can be made whatsoever - all automatic.  And the frame rate drops from about 15 to 5 (if you are lucky) - making movements all \"run\" together on playback or live.  Almost worthless.Support is not good - you can learn more on the forums from others (who are mostly complaining about Logitech support!) than calling Logitech.  I know more about these cameras than most Logitech support personnel, who seem clueless and to be reading from a check list.  And don't waste your time asking for Tier 2 support - they will NEVER call you back; apparently the sport at Logitech ALERT Support(separate support, not like most Logitech support, which is typically great!) is to hide behind the support forum and private message people with \"pat\" answers - ignoring the question - I actually had 5 exchanges with a Tier 2 person asking me question after question that was PREVIOUSLY ADDRESSED IN GREAT DETAIL IN THE FIRST EMAIL - so that proves they don't even read the question.  Simply amazing.All in all, these cameras COULD be great - they are sleek looking, sharp in design, with good weight and balance; they mount easily (but the mounts are nothing impressive) and have some nice features (like ability to turn off motion lights) and wide panoramic field of view (Zoom is a joke though, you lose so much clarity with digital zoom it's all but worthless.)There are literally hundreds of people who have purchased these cameras asking for the most basic of basic features that come standard with most security systems, such as a scheduler, better motion sensitivity controls, better night vision (and controls); ability to manually record (nope, you cannot decide what or when to records, MOTION is the only way these cameras will record - no motion, no recording.)  No motion indicator so you even know when or if they are indeed recording.  Ridiculous.Before you buy these cameras, read the threads carefully on Logitech.com under their Alert system - I do believe that Logitech is working on some serious updates and improvements - their first update to Commander software was fairly pathetic, but they are promising some BIG enhancements (long overdue) with the next release (March?  who knows, they won't say more than \"soon\")  - if they do incorporate some of the needed improvements everyone is asking for, these cameras could/would be SUPER DUPER.  But right now, they're expensive, pretty to look at and while they do offer HD quality (again, daytime only and not in zoom mode) they are also somewhat unreliable (some cameras trail several minutes and refuse to catch up to \"LIVE\" - also very annoying).  Logitech needs to get their act together - but based on most comments from former WiLife users (previous generation) this system's SOFTWARE is not as sophisticated as their earlier system (but the cameras are MUCH better.)  Basically, they put this system out almost like a Beta test and are SLOWLY making improvements and enhancements that should have been in the initial release of any basic system.  If I wanted to be a beta tester, I'd sign up to be one.Will it be a good system one day?  ...probably - it does has tremendous potential but honestly, it's not ready for prime time - having spent almost $2000 to buy and install this system, I'm committed and just hoping that one day soon Logitech will issue a MAJOR software update (and some firmware improvements too) that lifts this camera up to the level it deserves.  RIGHT NOW, the cameras are substantially under-served by the software, which is almost so elementary it's pitiful.  And if I were to go away and the power flickered, even for ten seconds, I'd have 0 access to my system and no way to reset it.  Again, RIDICULOUS!I finally managed to get Logitech's attention with a rant on their forum (like so many of us have had to do) and they actually had a L2 supervisor call me - we had a nice discussion but basically nothing great came out of that except a lot of promises for future enhancements - if they are true to their word, I may ultimately be a very happy user, but so far, I could have gotten twice the cameras for half the price in another brand - probably not the video quality - but acceptable.  That is Logitech Alert's saving grace:  video quality during daylight hours, is excellent.  At night, not so much.Wake up Logitech!  You have a great product with lousy software (and even worse \"support\") - time to get your software engineers off their hind ends and get this nice camera system working like it should!  It's taking way to long and the general lack of \"response\" from Logitech on the forums is at best, limited and contrite.  After spending nearly 2 G's, I expect better than that.Oh, one more thing: if you want to have \"full function\" access on your Iphone or via a web browser, you will have to pay an annual fee - not very reasonable at $89/yr - especially when the only thing it brings is ability to playback \"motion alerts\" (of which there will be MANY if it's raining or snowing or the wind is blowing because their sensitivity controls are not able to adjust for these normal, almost daily \"events\" - and cannot distinquish between rain falling and some unauthorized human prowling around your home or business.  AND you cannot have full control of your cameras if you install this system on your laptop and go on a trip - you must leave the \"Commander\" on the network for it to work - otherwise you are limited to your SD recordings (all 2 GB of them, which can be a day or so if it's raining!)Good luck - but if I was you, I'd wait until you see some glowing reports about improvements and software enhancements before spending this kind of money.  It's just not quite ready for prime time.", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Logitech Lacking", "Author": "B. Pelton \"SoCal Bruce\"", "ReviewID": "R1BXVWTYY4JFH1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We have always been Logitech users and strong supporters so choosing their outdoor security camera seemed to be a no-brainer. Unfortunately this was not the case. We don't know whether it is just this product group or a corporate change in direction but- This product is poorly thought out, the support is all but non-existent and overall experience is regrettable.Others have mentioned the sad state of the bracket. I did not imagine it could be so bad. It is worse. It is weak and flimsy and, if the extension arm is put on, destined to fail.The product description says: \"Complete outdoor digital video security system, easy to install, no new wiring or networking needed\". While possibly true in some cases, it certainly was not in ours.Few of us have a  free wall outlet within a few feet of our computer yet you must plug a giant power supply/HomePlug bridge into a wall outlet by your computer. It cannot plug into a surge strip or UPS and, if you place it in the upper outlet (as illustrated) it will block the lower.  If you try to hang it off the lower outlet it is unsecured and is constantly trying to fall out. So much for dependability- no backup and limited stay-in. And you are out one entire outlet.The power supply/HomePlug bridge then is supposed to plug into your router with a short, flimsy flat CAT-5 cable.  If you are wireless you are out of luck. It is \"wireless\" meaning it uses HomePlug powerline carrier but not 802.11 Wi-Fi.If you have anything else plugged into your router you may also be in trouble. I have a network printer,  streaming DVD , satellite dish and a DSL modem which all got along fine before. When I plug in the Home-Plug device the whole network goes down. Tech Support might help me trick it into functioning but they do not call back or answer emails.The outdoor installation is interesting, too. The HomePlug bridge/power supply plugs into a right angle adapter that cannot fit in an outdoor box with anything else. It also wants to rock out of the outlet and must be secured.  You are out one entire outlet.The two circuits for the two HomePlug adapters have to be free of other devices that might interfere. If it doesn't work the instructions say to \"just\" plug it in to another closer outlet. So you have the \"freedom\" to mount it anywhere you have a dedicated outlet that has nothing else on the circuit. You cannot, necessarily, place the camera where you wanted to place it. I had an electronic outdoor lighting timer that could not coexist with the HomePlug.  You are now out one entire circuit.The outdoor supply/bridge is on a 2 foot cord and can be placed anywhere. Anywhere, that is, within about a foot of the box in a single acceptable orientation at the same height as the box and with a drip loop below.  It cannot mouth sideways right or left, above, or upside down. And then for the best part- it cannot be mounted in the sun!  You just bought an \"outdoor\" system that cannot be mounted in the sun!The camera once mounted on the aforementioned flimsy bracket is then wired with an equally flimsy  flat CAT-5  cable. The camera and the power supply have to be opened up to receive it. Oh, by the way, the camera cannot be mounted in the sun either!  Their outdoors must be different than my outdoors.After it doesn't work you call Tech Support and hold for half an hour if you are lucky. The guy then tells you that he thinks you have a bad camera but that he has to escalate to Second Tier Support who work sometime Monday through Friday.  They do not call or answer your email.My wife and I are both technical people in the electronics industry. We are not intimidated by technical issues and know quality when we see it. We haven't seen it in this product.", "Date": "October 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Good, The Bad, and The Missing", "Author": "R. Carboni", "ReviewID": "RKIKIRTJ3YE3Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "THE GOODSimple InstallationThe really impressive feature of the Alert system is that it can be up and running minutes after unpacking.  The software installs quickly, the cameras simply plug in to outlets, and there is nothing to configure or customize beyond that to start viewing images from the camera.  Likewise, the web browser application and mobile app are simple to install and launch.  The outdoor cameras will probably require a little more mounting time, but that is to be expected with any type of security camera installation.No Technical Knowledge RequiredUnlike some of the other IP camera options available, the Alert cameras require no technical prowess with things like port forwarding, SMTP configurations, or other router security options.  The cameras simply plug in, and the signal is sent ethernet-over-power to the router adapter.  I tested several outlets in my home, and they all worked without problems.Good ResolutionThe video resolution at ~900x700 is very good.  Stationary objects are exceptionally clear.Support for mobile devicesA nice feature is the mobile app to view live feeds of the cameras on devices like the iPhone and Droid.  It works very well with very minimal delay.  I use this feature on the iPhone, and it streams perfectly on 3G.ZoomAlthough it is only digital, the zoom feature is a nice option and easy to use.Custom motion detectionThe ability to \"paint\" motion detection areas on the camera's view is a great feature for outdoor cameras where there may be a lot of traffic in the background, or tree movement that will set off the motion detector all the time.ReliabilityADDED 12/15/2011:  I have been using the indoor and outdoor cameras for over a year now, and I must say that the reliability of the cameras themselves is first-rate.  I have not had any issues with lost signals over the ethernet connections or problems with the SD cards. All video records perfectly, and the outdoor camera still looks new. Remote viewing through the connection to the Logitech website could be improved some, as this is routinely slow or down.THE BADBroken Out of the BoxUnfortunately, my outdoor camera was broken out of the box.  The camera was not communicating at all with the SD card inside the camera, and therefore not recording anything to the computer hard drive either.  I was disappointed that there was no alert to indicate that there was a problem with the SD card.  The only indication of the problem was a red exclamation point over the SD icon on the storage section within Settings, which is not readily noticeable.  Hovering the mouse over the icon displays the message \"SD Card Problem\", but there is no other information about the problem.  I had to return the defective camera, and thanks to Amazon's quick replacement service, I had a working unit within a couple days.  It seems that are a number of reported problems with SD card communication.  This is clearly an area that needs improvement from both a quality testing standpoint as well as software diagnostics.Night Vision Movement and Frame RatesIt appears that the video frame rate degrades quite a bit when IR night vision is activated.  There have been comments that the frame rate is as low as 5fps.  I believe that is about right.  Trying to make out anything moving is very difficult unless the subject is very close.  During the day, the frame rate of 15fps is generally acceptable, but still creates blur in moving subjects.  These cameras would be awesome with something like 30fps at this resolution.No Options for Alternate StreamingAlthough using Logitech's website for video feeds is easy and convenient, not everyone is tech illiterate, and this product would be much more attractive if the feeds could be easily configured to stream through any server, like other products such as the Foscam IP cameras. The Logitech site was down for many hours within the first week I had the camera, and it was very frustrating not being able to remotely view the camera.  Reliability is key in a security camera, and I would rather be able to configure my own access than worry about a site that has already proven to be unreliable.  Since the camera is configured with a local IP address, I know it can be accessed with other software, but it should have alternative setup options available out of the box.Commander FeesI understand Logitech's incentive to create a revenue stream with so-called \"premium\" services.  However, giving the consumer the simple functions to watch recorded video and control the camera settings remotely is not very premium, and once again gives this product a bad taste for the tech savvy consumer.  There are many ways to remote to a home PC and control all the features with the installed Commander software, so paying $80 per year for this feature really is just for those who don't want to leave their PC on all day, but would have to leave the router on anyway for this work.Software GlitchesAlthough the software is fairly simple in functionality, I was surprised how many little glitches existed.  For instance, when expanding the Advanced sections of some of the Settings screens, the text is cutoff and doesn't display fully in the window, and there is no ability to scroll that area.  Another problem is that if you disconnect one of the cameras from the system, you then cannot remove that camera from the list.  This could be really annoying for someone who has to deal with a broken camera that cannot be recognized again.  They will never be able to remove the camera from the list.  There was clearly very little quality or usability testing done on much the software.Motion Detection SpottyThe logic incorporated into the motion detection and recording seems to have some glitches.  There are times when motion is detected and recording begins, but then recording stops and does not continue even though motion starts a few seconds later.  It is almost as if the camera waits for a certain amount of time before starting to record again after a previous recording.  This has led to major movement in the subject field not being recorded, and is definitely something in the software/firmware that needs to be fixed.  There are also times where the start of the recording is delayed, and a subject moving through the motion detection area is filmed just going out of sight, even though other times the motion is detected and recorded just as the subject is entering the area.  There is a sensitivity adjustment for each camera, but changing this one way or another has not improved the detection/recording spottiness.UPDATED 12/15/2011:  After using the camera for over a year now, Logitech has done a pretty good job of improving motion capture.  There are far less lost activities, and captures start just prior to the movement entering frame instead of when the movement is going out of frame.Live Remote View Times OutThe downside of streaming the video with the remote viewers through the Logitech site is that they do not want it streaming constantly, and their software will time out after a few minutes.  Although this is understandable from their perspective, it is annoying for those of us who want to monitor constantly.  I like to monitor audio, and leave the browser window open in the background to do so.  I would like to not have to switch to that window constantly to restart the connection.THE MISSINGNo Audio for Mobile DevicesI was disappointed to realize that the mobile app did not support audio.  It seems like such a simple feature to add considering it is supported in the browser app.UPDATED 12/15/2011: The latest iPhone version of the mobile app now supports audio.No Tilt/PanFor the price of these cameras, it would seem like mechanical tilt and pan features could be incorporated.  The $80 Foscam indoor camera can tilt/pan. Without pan, it will take more cameras to cover the same area.No Two-Way AudioAgain, a simple feature that less expensive cameras include.No Multi-Camera Remote/Mobile ViewThe browser and mobile apps only allow viewing one camera at a time, unlike the desktop Commander software.No Resolution or Frame Rate AdjustmentsI would like to see settings for less resolution at higher frame rates like some other cameras.SUMMARYOverall, the Logitech Alert system is a decent enough product, and for the non-technical consumer provides a simple way to install a video security system in the home.  There are better options out there, but these require a lot more knowledge about technical setup, and also may require dedicated computer hardware to support.  The Alert cameras are very good quality, and the software is easy to understand and configure. What this product lacks is maturity in the software/firmware, and quality testing before leaving the factory.  Hopefully, future versions will improve upon these flaws and provide a truly 5 star product - for now, I'll keep it a 3.UPDATED 12/15/2011:  I decided to upgrade the rating to 4 stars based on the improvements made by Logitech over the past year.  I would still like to see more custom options in the software, and the ability to remote view directly without using 3rd party software.", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great system with room for improvement", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "R27G5SZ2D8VAZC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As others have already mentioned, this is a great system for people that want to set up a good quality surveillance/monitoring system but don't necessarily have the technical skills to do so and/or don't want to run the wires all over their house for a CCTV setup. The powerline adapters make it easy to install the cameras anywhere you want as long as there is a power outlet nearby. There are some limitations there, but it should work for most common applications. In my particular case, I didn't use the powerline adapters and have my Alert cameras running from a POE (Power-over-Ethernet) switch, so the cameras are fully POE compliant. I won't go into pros of the system since they have already been covered by other reviewers earlier, but I wanted to mention a few things that are not necessarily cons of the system, but something I would have liked to have available:- The desktop Commander software can only be used from one computer on your network; if you have more than one computer at home, you will not be able to manage or monitor your cameras from other computer(s), unless you use the web version of the Commander on that other computer(s). If you only want to monitor your camera from another computer, you can just use the free version of the Web Commander for that, but if you also want to be able to manage your cameras, you will have to pay the annual fee as if you were doing it remotely. It would be nice to be able to manage your system from any computer on your network.- It would be nice to be able to schedule email alerts for only certain hours of the day. I only want to receive motion alerts from my cameras when I'm not at home, and I want them to stop when I get home because otherwise the system starts \"spamming\" you with emails from each camera every few minutes as you and your family keep moving around the house and triggering the motion detectors. It got to the point where I have to manually turn off the alerts when I get home, and remember to turn them on before I leave in the morning, which is easy to forget.- It would also be nice to have the Commander software included with the add-on cameras, or simply make it available for download from Logitech's website. It would save people that want to run the system via POE (without using the powerline adapters) a few dollars by not having to purchase the Master System since they don't need anything that comes with it other than the software.Maybe someone from the Logitech's team will read this review and decide to incorporate some of these requests into the future releases of the Commander software.", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best outdoor system on the market today!", "Author": "Linksys User", "ReviewID": "R3VOYPDI0L5057", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "From the moment I opened the box the Logitech Alert 750e Outdoor Master Security System with Night Vision was very easy to understand and had great setup diagrams with color coded ribbons for stress free setup. Where I was mounting the unit 20 feet off the ground I connected everything in the house and tested it to make sure it was working first. Once the camera was mounted in place I simply adjusted it to the area I wanted to monitor and then used electrical tape around the mount joints as they are not as tight as I would have expected and I did not want to have to climb a ladder after every wind storm to adjust. Setup was very quick after installing the mounting bracket.It should be noted the the ribbon (power) cable that connects to the outdoor camera is so flat and thin that you can bring it in through a window without compromising the window seal when the window is fully closed. This is a huge plus as I did not need to drill a hole for it.I set up email alerts and also I highly recommend if you have some blowing tree branches in view as I do that you set up particular areas for movement detections. If you do this and set the motion rate for recording you will capture only scenes of interest which makes it so much easier when reviewing recordings.The master system comes with the network hardware and the invaluable command center. This is extremely easy to navigate. You can zoom, pan and tilt effortlessly. I am thinking of adding this software for remote viewing as well.The night vision is suprisinging very very good in low to know light. I am extremely impressed with the night vision and have to say that it is well worth the extra money.The only drawback I can see to this system is that if you enable and use the audio component which comes built in and has great range, picks up way to much wind. I would like to see an add on for wind noise reduction. This would not keep me from highly recommending this product. I did a lot and I mean a lot of research (hands on and reading) before making my decision to purchase this camera and I am very glad I did.I highly recommend this product!

Richardson \"D.R.\"", "ReviewID": "RIIIYG50G4M62", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Before I can review this product I need to share some perspective. A friend of mine is getting divorced from an abuser. Since he can no longer hurt her physically he has launched a unending barrage of terror and harassment against her and her kids. Her house has been broken into. Her car and house have been vandalized repeatedly. She is often watched and stalked. Her kids are approached by strangers in cars who ask about personal details. Until she can get some proof the police can't do anything to help.I'm an IT guy - I know how to use technology. I bought the best video capture cards available. I bought a variety of cameras, looking for the best one. I bought the best surveillance software I could find. What I've ended up with is a tremendously flexible but not very stable system that is hard to support. I can use it, but she can't. I simply can't keep the system running for her. It requires restarts and troubleshooting. Not what you need to deal with in this situation.I also tried a pre-packaged DVR with cameras from one of the security companies. It's works, but the camera resolution is quirky, and it's not a windows system. She can use it, but not easily. The video is not accessible via her laptop or the web.Out of sheer frustration I bought this Logitech system with an extra camera. I had her set it up with me - she did most of the work. Twenty minutes after opening the box she had two cameras working perfectly (one issue I mention below). This system is far less flexible than the one I built. But it more than makes up for this in reliability and ease of use. She can easily manage the software. She can easily find and view recordings, and see when motion detected recordings were made on a calendar/timeline. I'm ordering 4 more cameras.There are a few issues: this system is limited to 6 cameras. Given that I have it hosted on 6-core processor system, it seems limiting. I apparently can run two systems on the same house wiring, but this requires two different PCs. I would prefer one PC, but can live with this limitation.The install process the system asks for a \"homelink password\" with no explanation as to what this is or why you want or need it. This was confusing. Even worse, after entering a password the system could not find the cameras. Apparently entering a password caused a firewall issue that I easily corrected. Most people would never suspect that it was firewall issue. Logitech needs to do a better job on documentation and help with this feature. I still don't know why I was asked to enter a password or what protection it adds. This was a minor issue included here in case it's helpful to others.WARNING: adding a Homelink password made it nearly impossible to add additional cameras. The system is looking for cameras with the same password, which new cameras don't have. If you remove the password you have to reset any existing cameras to remove the password. This feels like a quickly implemented feature that is poorly documented and not very well thought out. I would avoid using this feature - it cost me about 3 hours of troubleshooting and angst. Logitech, you can do better than this. (I reduced my review from 5 stars down to 4 for this reason alone. When they get this fixed I will gladly add back that 5th star.)I would like to see a pan/tilt/zoom version of the external camera. It would make them just that much more useful.The cameras seem somewhat expensive. For what they cost I can get an excellent internet cam. However, internet cams don't offer the ease of use and consistency of the Logitech system. After having spent far more time and money than I ever expected playing with security systems, I can say that this system is a good value. It's easy to install, it works well, and anybody can understand it. You are paying for ease of use, reliability, good video quality, and a company that will answer the phone when you call.For somebody who is terrorized this system (should) offers some piece of mind and comfort. This is more than worth the additional cost over individual components or cheaper systems. If you need something that will get going quickly and reliably, that can be installed by a non-technical person, this is the best system I've found by a mile. I'll update this review after a couple of weeks.March 28 update: Now down to two stars. The cameras are fine. The software is terrible. I fight with it every night to keep the cameras connected. There is one camera the software will keep connected reliably. The others are intermittent and often require a reset of the camera to get the connection. Having to get physical access to ever camera every day is simply ridiculous.I recently discovered the these cameras work seamlessly with the BlueIris software, a 3rd party package that is far more flexible than the Logitech software (and without some of the convenience features). I have not had a dropped connection since connecting my cameras to BlueIris. I have no idea why Logitech can't get the software for their own cameras to work correctly, but I have given up on it. It's been too frustrating for too long. BlueIris also does not have a 6 camera limitation - I believe it will support up to 64 cameras.Given this, I can't recommend this package. The software is easy to use has a good user interface. It's a nice package all the way around. Unfortunately it's been terribly unreliable. The cameras work well when connected to BlueIris, but other cameras work well also.

When you read other reviews from folks that have had the camera for a few days please note the credibility of their review.I will not bore you with hundreds of words involving detailed analysis and personal opinions - I will make this as short and sweet as I can.Where and how this camera is being used: My wife operates a home based business with an entrance in the rear of our home. She needs to see the driveway so she knows when clients and others are in our driveway, coming and going with their children. It is primarily used in the daytime, but often times when it is dark as in the winter months. She views the camera image from her laptop and other computers in the home. Some using wireless and some hard wired.The camera is easy to set up. I am using this camera with a POE switch (purchased separately), after poor performance with the Powerline Network Adapter. This camera is now on a gigabit network with a CAT6 cable. The software is OK, but for more functionality go out and buy Blue Iris software instead.When the camera is connected to the software it gives a great image, the sound is adequate and motion detection is good as well. The lens has a wide angle view to it and I can see all of my 3 car driveway with it mounted under the soffit on one of the outside corners. The bracket is OK, but not real sturdy. You will need to modify the seal on the access door if you want to use a regular network cable.The problem is the camera will not stay connected. It drops out and usually comes back in a few minutes, but not all the time. This happens randomly almost every day. Go ahead and Google this problem, you will find it is quite common.New problem this week: the night vision is no longer working. Tech support is giving me the runaround even though it is under warranty. I do not have time for this and will simply go out and buy a better camera.My home network is fine and functions well. I am an IT professional that works with business networks daily, so it is not my home network or wiring causing the issue.The other feature that I think this camera lacks is a web based management interface. Unless you have a DHCP server at home you cannot assign a static IP address.My summary opinion: I would not recommend this product. Not worth the money I paid for it.

It runs on a Powerline network that eventually connects to your home LAN. While you could follow the instructions, a beginner/novice to computers may want to seek the assistance of someone more knowledgeable in PCs.The actual network connection is fairly slow. It takes awhile to update the Powerline firmware and Camera firmware. However, once that is out of the way the interface is actually quite easy to use. The camera quality is exceptional, and the motion sensing technology is very customizable. You can adjust the sensitivity to prevent leaves and small animals from setting off the camera, and you can draw your own motion sensing zones so as to avoid trees or other objects that frequently move.The videos are stored in MPEG-4 compression, which one can open and view via DivX codec equipped PCs or Macs. It does not continuously record, but instead only records when motion is detected. The audio recording is acceptable (better than nothing) and the cameras do not have motor control, they are fixed. The night vision seems to be active infrared which produces a monochrome image with a shallow field of view. It's not bad, but it's not great either. The indoor camera does not have night vision capability.The installation of the outdoor camera can be a hassle as you need to route the wire through the wall and into an adapter that plugs into an outlet. You cannot connect the adapters into surge suppressors or back-up UPS due to the powerline networking, which makes the Logitech Alert useless during a power outage unless you have the entire house wired to a backup generator.The Logitech Alert app for my Android smartphone (Motorola Droid 2) is very neat. I confirmed that it can provide real-time access to your feeds via the 3G network with some minor lag. However, the Logitech Alert app appears to have been designed for the iPhone or Android phones without hardware keyboards since I slid my keyboard out and the screen remained in the portrait mode.Overall: 3/5 stars, relatively simple to install, offers robust features for the average user, offers flexible on-board data storage options via micro-SD cards, can be accessed via a Smartphone!UPDATE: 2011-3-25I have experienced severe water intrusion with the outdoor camera. After using it for about a week, it has rained and snowed several days and caused the lens to fog up. I removed it for inspection and it was full of water. Apparently the rear gaskets aren't sufficient to prevent water from seeping in via the ethernet cord or the rear housing. Upon removal, I have noticed one of the screws not even being secured with a waterproof gasket/washer! The good news is that the camera functioned fine even with the water inside. The bad news is that it seems very difficult to dry out the lens area.There have also been server issues causing difficulties accessing the camera via my Droid2 smartphone.UPDATE: 2011-4-19After disassembling the outdoor camera in March, I set the camera above my fireplace to help accelerate the drying process. Once it was all cleared up, I used extra duct tape and electrical tape to seal up the potential water intrusion sites on the casing. After re-installing it, it has been operating without problems for almost a month even with severe winds, snow, and heavy rain.I found it frustrating to download/manage the video files stored on the mini-SD cards in the cameras. I don't see any easy way of doing this besides going into the review function of the Commander software and waiting for the files to download in random order. The files are stored as indiscriminate file names rather than a more sensible approach like YYYY-MM-DD, TIME, and CAMERA NAME.UPDATE: 2011-12-8After sporadic functionality of the outdoor camera, it is now longer functional. The water intrusion seems to have been resolved with copious amounts of electrical tape, the SD card is no longer recognized and the camera no longer records. Sometimes I can't even view the live feed with Logitech Commander.

Dean \"John\"", "ReviewID": "R274JSXZ6NI9WX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I started out back in the end of April trying to find some security camera to monitor problems I had with some neighbors.  My first one was the Logitech indoor one, figuring I'd just hang it in the window on that side of the house and that would be sufficient.  But my initial attempts met with failure, and disappointment on a number of levels.  I wrote a 2 star review of the indoor master system because of the things that just didn't work.  I tried three other systems after that, all ending even worse.  About the time I was trying the fourth system, I received an email from the guy in charge of their quality division saying he had seen my review and wanted to know if I was willing to try again, since they wanted to use the problems I had to help them tweak things and deliver a better product.  The fact that he contacted me simply because of the review I wrote intrigued me, and since I was not at all satisfied with any of the other systems I tried, I gratefully accepted the offer of help.  So I picked up another system, this one their External master system.  I went through the setup the same way I did the first time, and hit almost all of the same problems.  Errors about updates and unable to get to the internet from the software, problems with the iPhone and iPad apps not connecting right, and the fact that I use my media center computer as the \"master\" that gets all the recordings, but still wanted to view it from another PC that ended up mucking up some things.  But they helped walk me through the issues one by one, and got the system up the way I wanted it.  The update problem turned out to be something they heard about from a few other people, and said that just renaming the folder for now that had the update program in it would alleviate the errors, and that they were working on a resolution for it for the next software version.  They then walked me through some changes to the INI file on my second PC so that I could use it to view things without having it interfere with anything, since the cameras get their settings, download the video files, and everything based on the PC that touches them.  I tried to minimize the problem by basically duplicating everything exactly with my second computer but that actually caused as many issues as it prevented.  By basically nulling out everything I could in the INI file now, I can connect to the system without it causing the problems it was.They didn't do anything specific for the iPhone issues I had, but over the course of a few days, eventually it started working more often than not, and the troubles I had were enough for them to graciously put me into their beta testing for the next version, which I am running now and is night and day compared to the old version, both in options as well as in reliability.One trick I ended up learning - when adding a second PC, don't set up as a site, even a site with the same name.  You can cancel that part and just view then.  If you don't, like I didn't the first time, you'll end up with a second \"site\" on the logitech alert website when you view your cameras.  I was seeing two sites, both named the same, but only one with cameras.  It took a bit of beating up but finally I was able to remove that second null site.I had a problem with the base module that plugs into the switch actually causing a broadcast storm or something since after it was running for 18 hours or so, everything on my home network would no longer work, although my VOIP phone system did.  That was the only thing going straight into the router though, not into the switch everything else collapses into.  As soon as I unplugged the network cable from the switch, everything started working again and a quick power cycle of the network piece of the Logitech setup would let it work again for another 18 or so hours.  They promptly sent me a replacement and had me ship mine back to them for testing, and it has not happened again.The cameras run a bit more toasty than I would've been comfortable with normally, but even the three I have outside now, in the 100 degree weather we've had recently, have had no problems.  I'm even thinking it might help me in the winters, if the heat is enough to dissipate any snow that ends up on them... :)The night vision is quite impressive, although the detail isn't as good as it is during the day.  But it's easy to see and recognize people even from 30 feet away as they walk down the sidewalk here, although that recognition is mostly from size, shape, and movement recognition, not face.  But close up the faces are easily visible and recognizable.  The problem with night vision for me is bugs.  Seems a lot of insects love the little red emitting spots on the front of the cameras, so they play havoc with the motion detection.  If you leave it set to record during the night, you'll see a lot of bug activity.  But i've also got some great shots now of lightning strikes nearby that I pulled from the recordings the cameras have made during storms at night, so it's not all negative. :)Motion detection overall is really the biggest weakness it has I think.  The majority of my recordings are things like bees flying past, or birds.  There is an option for sensitivity, but it's never made any difference for my setup.  The one thing I'm hoping for in a future upgraded software version is a way to specify the size of something to trigger the recording, so that the birds hopping slowly across my front lawn doesn't get the recording going every time, but the person does.  Also, rain storms, headlights flashing across the lawn, or lightning all will trigger the recording.  Even the reflection of a car on the wet sidewalk as it drives past will be recorded if it's in a motion zone.Another nice bonus I hadn't known when I started was that the system will backfill a bit when recording is triggered, so when something crosses the motion detection zone, it'l actually also add to the recording about 5 seconds or so of the cache prior to the trigger activity.  That way you can see what \"lead up\" to whatever happened within the motion zones, and it also does the same for after, giving a few more seconds after the motion zones have been left.Since I have it running on my media center PC, one feature I like is that when it's open on the desktop, if you're using a camera with sound enabled, you hear the sound, but if you minimize it, it stops playback of the sound through your system - which is nice for someone like me that is using the system on the same thing they use to control their TV.  Little touches like that really help show how much effort they've put into polishing this system.  And the fact that I could email them saying \"this is happening,\" and get a reply saying they've found whatever it is to be an issue, and are already addressing it for the next release...In fact, the system has impressed me so much that I now have a total of four cameras on my system, three external and one internal.  And it is amazing how much of a deterrent they are for the stupid actions of my neighbors.  After getting the first two cameras installed, my life here has become much more enjoyable just for that factor alone.In the back and forth email correspondences I've had with two of the people involved with the product now, the things that aren't present or not quite what I would have preferred I've found are at least on the table for changes, if not already actively being changed.  One of their big requests is an easy way to stop recordings.  It's simple to stop the alerts and emails, but recordings you have to go and set the sensitivity all the way to Zero individually on each camera to disable them from recording motion.  I was originally doing that every night just so I didn't have to watch the bugs when I went through the videos, but I'm hoping that since it's such a popular request that one of the feature enhancements in the future will be an easy way to set a schedule, so that, say, from 12 to 3 on Saturdays when I cut the grass it knows not to be throwing hundreds of files on my hard drive of me doing so.  Another thing I would love to see is a way for another computer to view directly the feed without causing some of the issues I've hit because of the commander software trying to update settings in the firmware of the cameras.  Although even better than that, would be a way for an iPhone or iPad to directly access it to view realtime, since with either the software or just a web browser, you're seeing a delayed feed due to the fact that the traffic has to pass from your site to the logitech servers, then to your device you are viewing with.  So there's anywhere form a 5 to 10 second delay to as long as 35 seconds I hit one weekend.  They've told me that the direct view from an iPad or iPhone is something they're considering.  I hope that one becomes a reality since I think that would be a great feature.  Another possibility they're talking about is a Mac version of the software, which I would like as well since I run the system on a Mac Mini that is running Windows 7 boot camp for my Media center, but I also have a new 15\" Macbook Pro that I'd like to use more than just the web version on.I spent about 2 1/2 months using the system and the default free web service, but I got on the $79 program a week or so ago, and have to say that I wish I had done so sooner.  It made it so much better to be able to control everything from anywhere else.  One of the nice things with the iPhone and iPad is that the software doesn't change, so you don't have to download another version.  it simply offers the extra features if you subscribed to it, no new app needed.  And even from a web page, you have pretty much all the control and settings options that you have from the commander software.  It's very well done and certainly something I'll keep subscribing to as long as I have my system, especially if the newer versions have some of the fixes and additions I hope to see.I love being able to see all around my house, in every direction, from the couch.  And not just to see what is happening with the people and kids around here, but even for weather.  We've had a lot of storms lately, and I can easily see when the bad stuff is heading this way from any compass point now through the cameras.  It even helps at night when I'm laying in bed reading on my iPad and wonder if I closed the garage door or not.  I just open the software on the iPad and take a look at the camera showing my driveway, since the field of view includes enough of the garage that I can see the bottom of the door if it's closed, or the seam in the garage if it's not.And when I have it on my TV, it's easy to jump full screen for a nice shot of all four cameras at once, or just double click any of the camera views to bring that one full screen by itself.  Double click again to go back to the four screen view, and pick another.  Changing cameras positions in the grid display is as easy as simply clicking it and dragging it to another square.Field of vision is very impressive, and the ability to zoom, pan, all digitally, so that people you may be monitoring aren't even aware of it, since there's no motor moving a camera around, no lens spinning as it zooms, like so many other systems out there had.  I'm amazed at how much I can see to the sides, although there is the fisheye bending effect at the very edges of it.If you have a camera that ends up out of time sync for some reason, the trick is to get onto the windows machine, go to the time settings, and if it wasn't already, set it to sync with an external internet time source.  Close the Logitech Commander software, then do the \"sync now\" option.  When it shows that it successfully synced the time, reopen the Logitech Commander software, and the camera should now be in sync again.I have to say that the people at Logitech that I've dealt with have been top notch and helpful way above and beyond the call of duty.  It was their initiative that got me to try the system again, and helped me work through my issues and concerns enough to now have four cameras going.  I've got several clients (I build networks and support servers and such) that have seen me checking out things remotely and are interested as well now in using these, since the ease of using the electrical system in place of running coax cables is blatantly obvious to them.I'm ultimately very glad that I had bad experiences with the other systems I tried, so that I did end up coming back to these logitech units.  None of the software or features on the other units had the power and flexibility I have now.  And if Logitech ups the ante by doing some of the things I'd like to see added, then it's going to put them so far out of reach of the competition that there will no longer even be a way to compare them to the others.Edit - My comment about the idiots next door having stopped their depredations because of the cameras doesn't seem to hold as true anymore, evidently they read the review and today decided to be even more idiotic.  I finally got tired, called the police, and their \"but we didn't do anything but ride around\" defense fell flat when I could show the police exactly what they were doing and saying for the last few hours.  So while it may not have stopped the stupid behavior, at least it helped show it when needed for law enforcement.Edit 6/10/2012 - I'm now up to six cameras, three externals, three internals with night vision as well.  Really looks great on my 55\" LED TV when I have the view maxed, like a nice high tech security center.Edit December 2012 - Now there is a \"Mac Commander\" program so you can use these with a Mac system.  There are some really nice improvements with the Mac version - you can \"pop out\" each camera and size it differently and float them at different points on the desktop - the Windows version is a fixed format, can't resize, only pick what shows and how they're laid out.  More control immediately from the main window as well in the Mac version - what I absolutely HATE about it though is it does *NOT* connect locally to the cameras.  For some unknown lame reason, Logitech has decided to force it to go out your internet to pull the video from *THEIR* servers - so your cameras are using bandwidth sending the video signal to Logitech, then you double that by pulling it back into your system.  I don't know how much bandwidth they're using outbound, but inbound it sucks about 350Kb of bandwidth for me to watch the feed - and there's a 5 to 6 second delay as well.  So without an internet connection working, you may be out of luck.  They claim that it will fall back to a \"local\" connection if your internet is down, I haven't tested that out yet but will and report back here.  But the whole \"send the video to Logitech then send it back to the user\" is just a total waste of bandwidth.  I'd rather direct connect to the cameras with the Mac the way the Windows version does.  Their plan is to move the Windows version to be like the Mac version so at some point, if you stay current, even the Windows version is going to waste bandwidth and force you to watch everything time shifted as well...  I'll be sure I don't upgrade my Windows side that controls everything when they make that boneheaded move...  Meanwhile the system is still working great and I absolutely love it.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Professional's Appraisal: Excellent Equipment", "Author": "Brian Baker", "ReviewID": "R27VBRD7E4N36F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To give you some background, I'm a former Military Intelligence Agent, and hold a current PI license in California. One of my areas of specialization is security.Through Amazon's Vine program, Logitech graciously provided to me a system that included two cameras: one for exterior application, and one for the interior.Software installation on my home computer (Intel i7 Dell Studio XPS 8000, Win 7) was flawless and incredibly effortless. The camera signal receiver is then installed by simply plugging it into a house outlet and your computer system or system's router. Once installed, the software checked for updates, then searched for and found the cameras.The camera installation was also incredibly easy. Connect the physical camera by wire to its transmitting box, which then plugs into your house electrical wiring through any standard outlet. Every single bit of necessary hardware is in the boxes, including everything needed for the physical mounting of the cameras to walls or ceilings.The quality and coverage of the image was simply outstanding (including sound). I tested the exterior camera by placing it in my garage with the doors closed and the lights off, and even in near total darkness there was still a very good and usable image on my computer monitor.Each camera can record up to a week on the internal 2GB Mini-SD memory card, and cards of larger capacity can be used to extend that time. If recording is being stored on the memory card -  if your computer's not on, for example - it then backs up to your computer when your computer comes back online.There are some considerations to keep in mind when deciding on camera placement. The weakest link in any security camera system is the power/comms connection from the camera to the base. If this is disabled, you have a basically useless box hanging there. So you want to make sure that any approach to your camera's external wiring is in the field of view of the camera.Anything recorded only on the camera's internal memory card is useless if the camera is torn off and stolen. You want to keep the computer on and functional for monitoring/recording purposes.Nothing is foolproof. If someone steals the cameras and the computer, you essentially are left with nothing. It makes sense to have a reliable offsite backup in effect that's regularly backing the video up, something like Carbonite, perhaps.Obviously, if the power goes out at your house, the system goes inoperative. Not much you can do about that, unless you have an auxiliary power system in place, rare in residential environments.I think this system is exceptionally capable for a residential application; extremely well-made, durable, and of very high quality.Five stars.", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Outstanding camera!", "Author": "Johan Ballin", "ReviewID": "R2B6SME28FDJOU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The video quality is excellent. I was amazed how well the camera \"sees\" at night, as well. This is the best product on the market for a video surveillance system by far! The only drawback is its reliance on Ethernet over Power aka Powerline.I did have some initial difficulties installing the product and this is the only reason I don't give it a full five stars. The camera itself as well as the software gets a full five stars, for performance as well as quality! The camera(s) come with Powerline (Ethernet over Power) adapters and this is how the camera(s) communicate with software you install on a Windows machine. I have an older house and all outlets are not on the same phase. This is a major potential \"gotcha\" if you have older wiring or wiring and/or outlets on different phases (crossing the fuse box). In other words, make sure your electrical wiring will support EoP (Ethernet over Power).Fortunately Logitech has great support and a great online presence that came to my rescue. What I didn't know - and this really should be documented better - is that the cameras support PoE (Power over Ethernet) aka 802.3af.NOTE: Ethernet over Power is data communications sent through high voltage electrical wiring (e.g. 120V) whereas Power over Ethernet is essentially the opposite, high voltage sent through Ethernet. The main advantages of Powerline (EoP) is ease of configuration and that you don't need to run Ethernet cables across your home. The main advantages of PoE is superior technology, signaling and thus performance and reliability. The only drawback is that you have to run Ethernet cables to/from your devices.You can connect your camera(s) directly to a PoE switch!! Personally I think this is a much better option than Powerline adapters that rely on EoP. Nothing beats a good wire! As soon as I discovered that the devices support PoE I bought a couple of 8-port Netgear PoE switches (fanless so completely silent!) and wired my cameras directly to my PoE switch. The Alert Commander software found the cameras instantly. No additional configuration was required!Logitech needs to offer a PoE solution out of the box. I would suggest two versions:1. Camera system with Powerline (will probably work in most homes)2. Camera system with a PoE switch and additional cabling (this is what geeks and folks with poor/old electrical wiring will want!)Logitech support and response to my initial difficulties sets Logitech apart from other vendors. I am a very happy owner of several other products, such as a Netgear NAS Ultra+, switches, webcams, etc, etc. This is a great company with great people!On that note, I'm buying a couple of more outdoor as well as indoor cameras! :-)", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "The bad things, mostly - Logitech Alert 7xx Security Camera", "Author": "Q. Wang \"Q.Q.\"", "ReviewID": "R1GZENOWCN3EZG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "NB: LOGITECH DOES NOT SUPPORT THIS PRODUCT RUNNING ON AN APPLE COMPUTER. HOWEVER I'M RUNNING IT INSIDE OF A VIRTUAL MACHINE, VMware, ON AN iMAC. MOST OF THE ISSUES, EXCEPT FOR ONE ON WHICH I REPORT, HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS WAY OF RUNNING LOGITECH'S PROGRAM. ONE PROBLEM DID RESULT FROM MY COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT (the software update) AND LOGITECH'S SUPPORT PERSONNEL RESOLVED THAT FOR ME AND IT'S NO LONGER AN ISSUE (see emails below).I'm going to mention mostly the negative things about this model; please look at the four and five star reviews on Amazon.com to find out what people say they like about the Logitech Alert 750e. I've had another brand of camera running for over a year now, the Aztak Mole, a WiFi camera, motion-sensing. I've tried several others in 2010 which I've returned because of poor ease of use, setup difficulty and other irritating features:  Foscam FI8908W Wireless IP Camera  Axis 207W Wireless Network CameraPHYSICAL -This cam is hefty and if that's an indication that it's well made I probably believe it. It's pretty, too, and it has colored indicator lights that tell you what it's doing. That comes in handy if, for example it's mounted under the eves and you can see that from your window. The Hardware is very well thought out and plugging everything together took longer than in Logitech's promo video, only because I examined everything carefully and marveled at the attention to detail that is embodied in this product.However... The screw-mounting hole on the case is not attached near the cam's center of gravity. So, if you want to use it, say, on a window sill using a small camera tripod (it fits), then the camera will tip over.MANUAL -There is no paper manual. There is a quick start guide, which is well designed and was enough for me to plug things together. As for sitting down with a book and reading about the features and limitations before or during the use of the camera, forget it. There is a HELP feature - see below.INSTALLATION -There was a glitch in an otherwise clean install. At one point the the software complained that it couldn't detect the camera. After wasting about half an hour, I saw an on-screen note that, for PoE cams, this message can be ignored. I didn't know what PoE cams are (I found out later), so I continued and everything went swimmingly.TIME STAMP -There is no time stamp on the images! -- this is one of the most important features a security cam should have, for legal reasons, amongst others; That's what I think.  And it's almost impossible to tell what time a video was taken from the file names which the camera produces.VIDEO ACCESS / QUALITY -The picture quality (720x960) is good and there is some spherical distortion, as can be seen on the online adverts for this product. This is normal and can be expected for wide angle security cams.ZOOM -The zoom is only 'digital', however -- it's not a real optical zoom. This means it only makes a subset of the image bigger, but the detail, the resolution, is as it was before the cropping and enlargement: enlargement are 'grainy' (as they often call that these days -- a term borrowed from film photography which actually had grains of silver halide on the surface of its film). This kind of zooming business ain't nothin' to write home about but this wasn't made more or less clear to me in the advertisement for the camera.The current view is NOT shown when the cam is in replay mode, so you can't see what's going on, say, if a burglary is in progress, while playing the video -- until later.  There's no option for that, although space is available if not all cameras are used. You'd have to pull up a web browser window to do that.Resizing the picture area to be monitored (Zooming) carries along the active motion sites which have been outlined by the user, if any. It's desirable to select the motion-sensing area to omit triggering the camera due to the motion of leaves, for example, and this does the job at any magnification.MOBILE DEVICE ACCESS -It prevents access to your other security cams when trying to access them from a mobile device like an iPhone: I use Aztak Mole cameras in addition to this Logitech model. After I key in its URL, [...], sign in to see the camera's live view), I either get a screen from Logitech [sic] advertising 'Commander' software for sale or download, or I get a message saying that I can't connect to my Internet wirelessly! This happens with all the browsers I've tried - Safari, Opera and Terra. I hate this feature. Logitech should not block this Internet access from my iPad.Logitech provides, for free download, its app for mobile devices and it works. It gives the save view and options (none) as when accessing the am cir a web page. In both instances however the pop-up message \"Press to continue\" appears, ad nauseam, so you can't sit back and enjoy the view as if you were watching some other thing on your computing device.The iPod app downloaded (free) from Apple is made for a display the size the iPhone. When expanded on the iPad to full screen size the picture is of course quite low-res.  If the this is an example of the software that Logitech sells as adjunct to the camera, then I don't want it.  I've been afraid to buy it to try.On the subject of browser access - I'm used to accessing the old (2010) Mole cam from my office via Internet Explorer or Opera or Mozilla, to view what happened - did the mailwoman leave a parcel on the stoop? Are the horses in the barn or are they out? That web based screen gives me the option of seeing previously taken pics stored on it's on-board SD card. You can't do that with this Logitech camera.BAD HELP -HELP tab in Logitech Alert Commander opens the familiar (Windows) help feature but using its SEARCH feature causes Logitech's system to stop responding: The message \"Logitech Alert Commander Help (Not Responding)\" obtains in the title bar at the top of its window. Next, the Help window itself grays out and then the perpetual revolving circle cursor appears whenever the mouse is hovers over this window or over the Logitech Alert Commander window.Windows 7 offers an option to search for a solution to THIS problem, but when selecting that option Logitech Alert Commander commits Rapture -- it closes and one has to re-start it afresh. SUPPORTThe support web page at Logitech.com asks for a username and password, but it won't accept the one I've set up in the software and in product registration. After another laborious account setup procedure and after having to make up and remember yet another new password, all I got was a email: \"Thanks for submitting your question. Use this reference number for follow up: #110615-003872\". And that was four days ago.A MAJOR Failing -No Time Stamp appears on videos, as is featured in all security cams I've seen. From looking at a frame, one has no idea of when that picture was taken, not even approximately. The user-given name of the cam is identified, however, a small perk, since it's usually / often obvious from the scenery around one's house. When saving a frame from the playback, no time or location annotation appears in the resulting jpeg picture. You lose provenance, so to speak. Try showing THAT to the police, or to an insurance company to prove how your property looked before the mishap happened.  I still have no idea when my video snippets were taken.SOFTWARE UPDATES - please  G o o g l e  nowscape+suck+logitech to find my web page about that.Program pop-ups keeps pestering for 'firmware updates' but updates don't work -- the old version remains and the new version is not updated. To obtain this null result a long time is needed. I have version 3.0.176.  I ma running under VMware on iMac.I called Logitech Support(888.469.4543) early afternoon and Darren answered right away, no waiting, and he is a friendly fellow.  He sent me an email which delineated some steps (10 steps) to try to get the update to take, but to no avail; it did not work, but later Logitech did send me an email which took care of the problem (please  g o o g l e  nowscape+suck+logitech to find my web page about that).I asked if the new versioned software would have a timestamp and Darrin said no. Darren probably thought that I'm a space alien from the planet Kolob, judging from his reaction. He said some people use this camera to watch heir goldfish -- a time stamp really isn't needed for that and I think that's probably so. But it's needed for the things for which one actually  buys a security camera, as evidence in court, after apprehension of a thief! I had this need a few years ago, but I didn't have a security camera; that's why I have cameras now and I want this timestamp feature, especially for a camera in this upper price range; it's not asking for much.Re-FORMATTINGFormatting the supplied SD micro card takes approximately 45 times as long as it takes my regular camera to do a deep format.Running the diagnostics produces a file which shows what problems, if any, were found. However it does not detect, apparently, that there is something amiss with the format. I can hear the camera click when it makes an image, but that image does not appear in Logitech's directory on on the C drive. However formatting the SD card seems to fix that.MOTION SENSING -When the motion sensitivity is set to its factory default position, walking 15\" in front front of the camera at a normal pace ACROSS its field of view it does not trigger picture taking. This obtains, especially after it has just captured a video and its red light has ceased blinking and returned to a steady illumination, indicating that it's ready for more action.The Logitech Alert Commander software is pretty and has some good utility. However the \"Display\" feature of this Alert Commander is awkward gad confusing and sometimes wrong. Sometimes it won't show files (its function is so select files for viewing) unless one restarts the program. Maybe this has something to do with the reformatting problem mentioned above, I don't know.THE GREEN TIMELINE BAR of the Alert Commander Software -The \"Display\" feature of the Alert Commander has a timeline view where \"<\" and \">\" symbols bracket a green timeline bar, which when clicked advance the the time display forward and backwards. The green bar shows where, along the displayed time line, videos were taken. However during playback of the files, clicking this not only moves the time window left or right but it causes the displayed file to jump from place to place. Deleting a video can be accomplished by right-clicking (but not by using the delete key). More than one file segment cannot be selected for deletion, say by dragging the mouse along the line which represents those segments -- something that is common in audio and video editing software. It's not intuitive. When deleting by right-mouse clicking, it's not obvious what's to be deleted. On the green timeline, a red cursor follows the current time-position of the frame being displayed. This green bar can be stretched or compressed, a nice feature -- but because of that it's never clear the extent to which a deletion will take effect, because that extent always show as green, like the rest of the bar's extent that is associated with video clips. The extent does NOT change color when right clicking, so that one might have a preview / clue of the range of the imminent deletion.When using the \"<\" and \">\" of the timeline bar to slide the green time line bar left or right, its associated red cursor becomes disassociated -- it does not move with it. Instead, it stays positioned relative to the screen, not not in relation to the time at which it had been stationed. Thus you lose the spot which you were reviewing, only because you wanted to move the timeline.  The same happens when you want to increase / decrease the resolution of the displayed timeline, a feature which is provided so that you can spread the extent of the time display from hours to seconds.During display playback, the red cursor which shows what time is playing on the timeline and displaying on the screen, can sometimes march off into the future, ad infinitum, on its own -- a time where there couldn't possibly be a video -- because that time hasn't happened yet! How could this have escaped Logitech's 'quality control'? And when you manually stop the cursor there is no button to cause it to go 'home'.Sometimes, when playing material, it does not play for an extended period of time, instead showing a blank screen, even though no files have been deleted and the timeline that shows playable files are present. Repositioning the red cursor, manually, at a point in time before this malfunction allows the material to be displayed.Another problem with Alert Commander's green timeline bar is that sometimes, when one clicks a spot (file) on it to select one video segment, it turns white, indicating that there isn't a video recording after all! Who would what such a feature? I'm guessing that this happens because the user has deleted videos in the default folder to which the cam has saved its output. The cam does not check to see if the files are sill there -- it assumes that they are -- and it keeps the green colored segments in the display. I suppose that's because the programmers didn't think to check from time to time if those files still exist -- something which they could easily do since they do it once already. That's my opinion. At least this should be done shortly after booting up the Alert Commander software.It seems that the green bar can confine video material from the onboard SD card as well as from the default video directory, but I'm not sure. In any case, one can't be sure of what the source of the video on the green bar is. At least I can't tell. So, If I delete something, say, a pic of me embracing my girlfriend, can my wife later find it anyway?STILL PICS -I don't see an option to take only pictures -- snapshots; only videos seem to be produced. Still photos would conserve a lot more storage space and are suitable and more convenient for many situations. It's not too difficult, at least conceptually, to provide, even AFTER the fact, pictures of the scene BEFORE during and after motion has been detected.DELETING -When one deletes the videos in the directory in which the software has saved them, Alert Commander software doesn't notice that and continues to show a green bar-timeline which represents stork data, which, of course when attempting to play it, happily displays a blank screen. It doesn't skip that green colored area with no data. Seemingly Alert Commander doesn't refresh itself before it begins playing. Alert Commander acts as if it's playing a movie snippet even when it has nothing to play!There is no way to turn the camera off remotely.  It's always on.DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT -In the two years that I've been using my present computer, I've never had Windows-compatible purchased software behave so badly, except for this Logitech Alert Commander thing. Perhaps many of the problems I see are addressed in the new updates which won't update to my machine. I have version 3.0.176. At time of this writing (June 2011), version 3.0.196 is available, presumably 20 releases newer as mine, but as mentioned above, this won't update on my computer. I run Windows 7 via VMWare emulation on a 27in iMac. Everything works, except this software. I don't think my configuration is the problem; if so, Logitech should have mentioned this in its systems requirements, but I'm willing to be educated about that, if anyone knows for sure. I've contacted Logitech about this problem several days ago and have received no reply. I've also asked them if I could do this update outside if theta commander software -- no reply.--I am disillusioned and very very tired of having to spend so much time fiddling with poorly thought out and sloppily implemented software that doesn't work out of the box and I feel obligated to warn others about what may happen if they buy these things. I hope that manufactures read user reviews / complaints and take away from them what they can do to make it better. Please feel free to contact me, thanks.*  To find this review as well as email correspondence online, please  g o o g l e  nowscape+suck+logitech  ****** Update ******UNINSTALL -After futzing around with this, trying it for about two weeks, I found this thing too difficult and inconvenient to use for the reasons above.

I owned the wilife system and, while video quality was superb to the Wilife, the cameras would flake out constantly, requiring a reset.  I found another piece of software and was able to prove the problem was the Logitech software, not the cameras.  Finally, two weeks ago, Logitech put out a massive update to the software and camera firmware.  The cameras are 100% stable!  What an improvement!!!!  Since the update, I've had no issues with disconnects and the motion sensativity problems have been fixed.I must say, I was po'd with Logitech about this system.  No longer!  I'm about ready to order my fourth and fifth cameras!

Deano Jr.", "ReviewID": "R1991ABP9FEUB1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Original post:I just set up two cameras, one in a detached boathouse about 100' away from my house and one inside the house.  The Powerline connection works so well, I'm ordering two more cameras to give me total coverage of my property.  I previously had a Sharx camera that gave up the ghost after a year and a half.  It worked well, but I could never get the remote viewing option to work.  The Logitec software was almost bullet proof!  I was instantly able to view both cameras via my browser and my Droid, no hassles at all!  What a pleasant surprise! The only problems I've noted so far is that the Android app can't find the cameras the second time you open the app.  A Force Stop and re-open brings everything back.  It's a small price to pay, and I'm sure Logitec will fix that eventually.  The other problem was an incompatability with a Netgear XAV101 Powerline adapter that I was using to connect a Replay TV to my network in a room that wasn't wired for Cat 5.  I disconnected both units (the one connected to the Replay and the one connecting my network to the powerline) and everything on the Logitec side worked as advertised.  After I got the Logitec system up and running, I reconnected the Netgear units to see what would happen.  The Logitec system lost both cameras.  I unplugged the Netgear unit connecting the powerline to my network, and the Logitec system is working again.  UPDATE: Just to see what would happen, I plugged the Netgear XAV101 Powerline adapter that is connected to my Replay TV back in and everything is working as advertised (Alert Cams and Replay TV connected to my network/router through the Alert Powerline adapter).  Glad I didn't have to sacrifice my Replay TV connection to get the Alert cams!BTW, despite what Logitec says in their manual, I connected their master unit to a D-Link DGS-2208 10/100/GB switch and it's working fine.  I do hope their built in surge protection works, as I'm feeling a little naked plugging these expensive cameras directly into the wall sockets!Update:The Android App to view these cameras worked \"OK\" on my original Droid (lots of Force Stops, but I could usually eventually access the cameras), but there is NO WAY to access the cameras with the HTC Thunderbolt.  When you try to open the Android App it gives you some kind of Memory Error.  If you try to access the cameras through the browser (and I've tried them ALL), there's no way to call up the keypad to type in your account info.  I complained to the Logitech Alert Team they said they were aware of the problem and researching a fix.  That was over a month ago.  I hope they don't sell a single camera until they fix this.BTW, the resolution on both the internal and external models is pretty bad.  Not sure I could ID anyone with them if I had to.Bottom line is that until their customer support improves and they fix their BROKEN Android software, I do not recommend buying the Logitech Alert Cameras.Update:They finally fixed their Android App, but one of my two network connectors fails intermittently (mostly failed, but occasionally works for brief periods).  I have been working with their tech support for over a week and they still refuse to honor their warrantee.  I even offered to buy a replacement network adapter so I can get the two cameras that connect through it back online, but no response from them.  There's no way I'm buying another master system from them, and definately DO NOT RECOMMEND anyone purchase these things until Logitech gets their act togeather!", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Trade offs with Fix-wire, 750n Powerline, Wireless cameras", "Author": "S. Yung", "ReviewID": "R2AJZ1LGLNU7FU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update3: I see some user comments about why bother with using powerline when you can simply use Power-over-ethernet (PoE) with 750n.Since I use virtually all types of camera security systems including mobile camere security, I learn to appreciate the +/-s of each type of cameras using each of the different transport mediums. You are essentially making trade offs between the real-world physical properties of each of the solutions including SW, HW and firmware product tradeoffs.Some user(s) comment on why bother using powerline when you can use PoE. I agree, if you have a choice to choose PoE which is essentially connecting ethernet cables from Camera to Ethernet Switch. However, depending on the physical characteristics of your deployment environment, PoE may not be practical depending on if you are in a IT lab, Corp Office, Residential Office, or Home.In a Corp office, IT lab, or within a single room or short distances, running cables is relatively easy compare to a residential office or a multi-story residential structure where you may have solid walls, ceilings..etc. There are no easy way to run ethernet cables except to drill holes, or lay them on the floor or stapled them along walls and ceilings which is astheically unappealing to most users.When it is physically difficult to pull cables, you will need to use either Wireless (air as the transport medium) or Powerline (existing structure's electrical wiring). Each solution has their +/-s. I use all combinations to secure all types of structures from single story to multi-story, Corp office IT labs, or residences. Typically, as the distance becomes further and there is no easy to pull cables due to cost or physical barriers. Wirless or Powerline are the next logical solutions.Specific to the 750n Solution, the biggest attraction for me is Alert Commander Desktop App, Alert Commander Web Site, and Mobile App. I believe Logitech has the most polish solution, but not necessarily the most reliable because it is a more complex implementation than fix-wire and wireless solutions.The 750n/700n implementation requires not only a desktop application, this application must commuicate with the Powerline Adapter (HomePlug) Firmware programmed into it, and also the camera firmware. Wired and wireless camersa do not have to deal with the HomePlug firmware, one less component to deal with.That's why wired and wireless cameras I find do not have the camera discovery issues that the Logitech 750n Solution presents. It would be a none issue if they can do enough compatibility testing between the Alert Commander SW, HomePlug Firmware/HW(EMI filtering) and the Camera Firmware. All these issues on top of getting video streams to their website and mobile app. Overall, I'm very pleased with Logitech solution, but I still have significant reservations as decribed below.The issue that I am facing now is if I want to add more cameras, the Alert Commander sees the Homeplugs, but cannot discover the camera because, the camers is not requesting a DHCP IP address. This I can see clearly comparing the recently purchased 750n and 700n cameras vs. my existing 750ns. This means the 750 solution is not easily scalable (not always easy to add new components) if the versions of SW, Firmware and HW are too far apart, or just have incompatibility issues depending on when they spin their latest SW updates into their production cycles. Of course, I'm sure other solutions may have similar incompatibility issues, but the Homeplug adds one more component to the critical path which could make it a more fragile solution to some users, specifically in discovering or recovering lost cameras or connections. I don't blame them for getting piss off as I did, but I worked with their engineering/QA to get my network reliability issues resolved. However, the incompatibility issue that I am now facing is a much more tougher problem to solve due to the number of combinations..ie permutations possible between the different component versions.Update2: Why I like the Alert Commander the best, and giving it back a 4 starSince my original comments, I am giving credit to Logitech for having a 5 Star responsive customer support. Their Sr. QA Mgr has contacted me and is working with me to help resolve my network reliability issues which I will give now a 3 star instead of 1 star as I now have a better understanding of how to recover my cameras. In order to help other potential users of 750n and other security camera products I like to explain my experiences with different types of security camera systems and their features that are important for my needs (each user has their own needs), but hopefully my needs will cover most of others needs.I am currently deploying 3 types of security camera systems to monitor different office locations, each type uses different transport medium, and have their +/-s:Wired - I am using GE PTZ cameras and their Netview SW. Wired systems are much more reliable connectivity wise since they are fixed wires/ethernet cables..etc. The obvious drawback is they are fixed and hard wired. They are more costly to installed especially if you have multiple floors and/or in a residence. You basically have to drill holes..pull wires..etc unless it is commercial then you can pull cables above the ceiling panels.Wireless - I am using FOSCAM PTZ wirelss cameras and their IP Camera SW, but I also purchased Blue IRIS SW to control manage my wireless cameras.The advanage with wireless is you don't have the hard wired issues and can place them in locations that maybe more difficult and costly to install.Of course with wireless, you are subject to atmospheric conditions.Powerline - I am using Logitech 750 indoor and now outdoor cameras with Alert Commander. In my opinion, Powerline is a transport medium between Fixed Wire and Wireless. You are basically using existing electrical wiring systems which is great. No ethernet cables to pull, and in theory more reliable than wireless since it is fix wired, but via electrical outlets.The drawback is if you have electrical devices in those circuits that can generate EMI events...motors, fans, generators..etc. If you have a relatively clean EMI event location Logitech 750n will likely work flawlessly for you, but if you have multiple floors and not so cleam circuits, then you may likely run into the issues that myself and a number of other users have encountered (though they may not fully understand why they have those issues).With this said, I have some recommendations that can help users recover their cameras, but not always guarantee depending on your circuit situation.Recommendation: If you have control of your own IP Gateway that contains the DHCP server. When you loose connectivity, reset or flush your DHCP server which will then flush the DHCP cache that contains device IP addresses, and their physical MAC address. Do this in addition to resetting 750N camera(poke the needle hole with a paper clip or needle to reset camera), unplug and plug all adpaters. This will ensure all previous IP address leases to be renewed. I've seen this work like charm 9 out of 10 times. The other 10% of the time, there is still an issue with Logitech recovery algorithm likely in the form of \"State Machines\" built into the adapters, and the SW recovery process with the Alert Commander SW not synching the Camera IP and MAC address properly. I am working with Logitech to get this figure out so I can relaibly use 750n and Alert Commander myself.The flushing of the DHCP cache or resetting the DHCP server is unique to the router/gateway that each user uses. If you are using DHCP directly from ISP, then you won't need to deal with this step as the ISP will likely issue a new IP anyway when the camera looks for a IP address.So, why do I want to use the 750n with Alert Commander. It is for the following important reasons compare to other IP camera systems:1. Ability to create multiple detection zones and fit them to any size - I can create different detection zones move them around and size them as I see fit, and trigger alerts off of those zones. This the most powerful feature of any security system besides simply recording everything it sees in my opinion. This is very useful to me since I don't want to see 100s of email alerts for every movement around my office locations. I only want to see alerts whem sensitive locations of the offices are touched or entered into. I'm sure each user can think of many reasons why they only want to be alerted when a specific location is breached within the camera view and alert you for everything. You don't always want to be alerted everytime anything moves on the screen.The other software that I am using is Blue IRIS, Netview, IP Camera..etc all have motion detection and alerts, but they detect every movement, or example in the case of Blue IRIS, it's a screen centered square box that you can resize, but not relocate, or create mutiple box zones. I don't use email alerts with the other systems anymore, though they are always recording. I am using Alert Commander for email alerts with snap-shots instead.2. Richer UI Experience - I like the more intuitive look & feel of Alert Commander. Having worked on User Interface deigns and testing. I appreciate a high quality UI which I believe Alert Commander has over the other SW that I am using. It's just more efficient to use.3. Visually see and dynamically resize alert amd motion storage - This is another critical feature. I can easily see and resize the storage that I need. All the other SW require that I hard-code/manually entered the storage values. I cam always do this, but I really like the storage resizing feature of Alert Commander which is done on the fly.With all above said, I am giving 750n back a 4 star. I would give it a 5 if it is more network reliable which I believe Logitech need to seriously tackle if they want to beat the competition and dominate this market.=======================================================================================================================================================Update1: Why I am giving 750n a 1 starI have the cameras working for a week now at the only site that I have these cameras working. Last night I could not connect to the Alert Website. This morning I was able to, but my 2 remaining cameras could not be found. The site tells me I should remove my cameras. I know it's not a good idea, but I did it any way. I now can no longer can see any of my cameras on the website which now defeats the primary reason for my purchase of these cameras using the Alert Website. I am dropping from 2 stars down to 1 star. This is unacceptable for Logitech to have such a fragile network product. I can only say that I am disappointed with Logitech. I have used many of their products over the years. This is my worst experience with their products and overall the worst with any network products that I have experienced so far. Good luck to other users with this product.======================================================================================================================================================I am writing this review out of shear fustration and extreme disappointment with Logitech having purchased 6 x 750n cameras to enhance existing video monitoring of 3 different sites which already have fixed wired IP Network video monitoring. I am also not an average user. I have many years of designing, building and testing data center IP networks with all types of devices. I would have simply prefer to have the cameras working rather then to write this very negative review.There are 2 key issues that I have with the 750n (but I have to assume same for the other models as well) they are 1) Electro-magnetic interference (EMI) which causes the lost of connectivity between Alert Commander Software and the Cameras 2) Recovery of the IP connectivty between Alert Commander and the cameras once the EMI event goes away. I will keep my explanations simple, but before I share my fustrations, I will first highlight the positives.I managed to install 750ns into 2 of the 3 sites. The installations went very smoothly, and everything worked nicely as advertised. I was very happy.Now the negatives, I was very happy until all of sudden in one the locations, Alert Commander could no longer detect the cameras. The first time this happen I went plugging/unplugging adapters, resetting the cameras (poking the pin-hole behind the camera). I did this several times and still no cameras detected even though I had the deep purple light which indicated the camera saw the Alert Commander and the internet. After wasting couple of hours on my weekend going up/down several flights of stairs I decided to give Logitech Tech Support a try. I spent another 3 hrs on the phone until my phone battery went almost dead, and I decided not to continue the call (tech support was nice and patient though). It went from bad to worse. Now I had no more deep purple lights, just plain green lights indicating only power. The problem was way beyond tech support. They could only tell you the same thing that you could do yourself, unplug/plug, reset, reinstall Alert Commander..etc. I asked the TS guy if he knew where the IP addresses of the cameras were stored at by the Alert Commander, I was doubtful he knew, but I asked anyway, and he didn't have a clue. The key is having the ability to edit the Camera IP addresses and the associated physical device address (MAC address). If I could edit this info, I could ensure Alert Commander connect with the Cameras, but the Network SW design was meant to be dummy proof which makes it very dumb when something goes wrong. The inability to assign/edit static IPs is a significant weakness here due to the software design.Since I still have 2 cameras available and not yet installed at the 3rd site, I decided to install a new camera. The installation went smoothly. However, even after I remove the old Alert Commander software install, I had to locate the Windows Registry Keys and remove them with the Registry Editor so the new Alert Commander install does not go automatically into the Alert Commander screen bypassing the initial install steps.I was happy again, until the same thing happened. This time I was able to observe what caused the lost connectivity. I turned on a ceiling fan. When I turned it off, the deep purple lights came back on. So, I thought I should get my cameras back when I turned off my ceiling fan. Unfortunately not, I had purple lights, but cameras could not be found. Same thing all over again.Except this time, I happened to be monitoring and testing traffic on my network with 3 network troubleshooting tools. I was using 1) Wireshark which analyzes network traffic 2) IP Address/TCP Port scanner to detect what devices were on the network 3) DHCP monitor on my router to see which IP addresses were assigned to devices coming onto the network requesting an IP address.I will keep it simple as I can and get to the point.The fact that turning on the ceiling fan caused lost connectivity, it tells me there is very poor EMI filtering by the Power Adapters.Worse than that, the inability for the Alert Commander and the cameras to recover. I was able to observe the actual network communications between the cameras, router/gateway (which hosts the DHCP server that assigns the dynamic IP addresses) and the Alert Commander on my computer.The crux of the bad network software design is the following:Alert commander during the initial install detects IP and MAC address of the cameras. I have to assume it hides it somewhere in it's system files so users can't get to them (we should be able to though). Because, we don't know the IP addresses, we are blinded when it comes to troubleshooting. Because I have my network troubleshooting tools, I knew the initial IP addresses of the cameras assigned by DHCP. After the EMI event was over, I can see the cameras requesting new IP addresses from the DHCP server, but the Alert Commander is broadcasting the old IP addresses on the network asking the cameras to respond to it's request to establish connectivity. The cameras never responded to Alert Commander's broadcast requests, and just keeps asking for new IP addresses from the DHCP server (also want to add the DHCP requests coming from the cameras were labeled by the DHCP server as not understandable). This explains why the Alert Commander was never able to detect the cameras. There is no way to edit the camera IP address in the camera itself or the Alert Commander so they can match up the expected IP addresses that was previously assigned by DHCP. I am now totally screwed.The Logitech Tech Support was nice, but totally lacked the skills and tools to troubleshoot at this level. This requires the Logitech network engineers to figure it out if they had done proper negative network testing by injecting errors such as EMI interference tests.I am keeping the 2 cameras that are working in the one site, but have returned 3 of the cameras, and keeping one spare. My concern is if for some reason I experienced a power outage or some sort of EMI  interference, I may repeat the same BS again in the one site that has the working 750ns. I am now purchasing FOSCAM wireless/wired cameras instead to avoid this EMI and lost connectivity issue. I have no association with FOSCAM, but they are wireless cameras, and not using the power outlets for communications so not subject to EMI interference.I assume for users who do not have EMI issues in their homes or networks, the 750n will work fine, but once you loose connectivity due to some sort of EMI event. You may loose the cameras, and unable to detect them again if they go into this bad software loop state.I wish these cameras would just work. I do like the Alert Commander software features, and the centralized website to view the cameras when you can connect to their site. I like Logitech, but very disappointed with this poor network software design. Hopefully, they will improve and fix these issues with their next camera versions.", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "If they were only working on the software....", "Author": "Thomas Runge", "ReviewID": "R2Q2E88RAX8CZZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got my camera two days ago, the setup was very easy, hook it up to power and the computer (need a free router port), start the software and it is running. It could not be much easier.The problem is really the software in the camera and also the monitoring software. To me it looks as if this is another product that got rushed out the door without any quality testing (except for the poor customers in the field). The software lacks a lot of functionality and even the functionality that is being advertised, does not work:1.) There is no scheduling - if you set up alerts for motion detection, you get them 24x7... quite annoying2.) The camera (in the last two days) did not switch back to daylight (color) mode in the morning but stayed black/white until I manually pulled the power and recycled it.3.) The motion detection zones that can be defined instead of the whole picture, are useless because the camera and software actually ignore these and still interprete motion in the complete picture.4.) Deletinng recordings does not work correctly - you \"delete\" them and a few minutes later, they are back in the overview5.) Copying files from the camera's SD card to the PC is copying it, not moving these (most likely the reason why the delete function does not work.)6.) The best (local, not via internet) streaming frame rate that I get out of this setup is 11 fps which is choppy but good enough for me7.) The night vision is pretty much useless, passing cars are just dark shadows, people look like ghosts and I do not think that you would ever be able to recognize anybody on these pics unless that person is within 3 feet of the camera.8.)

There's no doubt about that.  And it is priced right.  So, despite what I have written below, it has to be one of the best solutions for a home security camera or system of cameras in a price range that is not prohibitive for most people.But it has many short comings.  It relies heavily on Logitech's website for a couple of really important functions - viewing the camera across the internet and forwarding alert emails.  Alternative products, such as some Panasonic cams, have the handy capacity of actually operating as their own web server for internet viewing and will allow you to configure them to use your existing email service for sending alerts.Currently, basic use of Logitech's web site is free, though there is a premium service that is a little fuzzy on pricing.  You have to put that premium service in your shopping cart to find out it is priced around $80.  But even then, it isn't clear if that is the registration fee or the subscription fee mentioned on the Logitech web site, or if it is both.  And there is nothing indicating how long the subscription is -- at least nothing I found on the site.The control software for the cam also leaves much to be desired.  It works great and it is simple to use, but it is very limited in its features.  Want to adjust storage space for captured images?  You can.  But only to certain preset amounts.  I wanted to set mine to 2 gigs, the size of my free Dropbox.com account so I would have a couple days of the most recent motion-capture videos stored off site.  But in that general range, the cam's software forced me to choose between a 1/10th of a gig (woefully inadequate, especially with more than 1 camera) or 10 gigs with no options in between.Want email alerts with snapshots of the motion detected by the cam?  You can get those - sort of.  You may have a single frame but not multiples, as is the case with some other products.Finally, you cannot install the cam's control software on multiple computers on your network; e.g., a desktop and a laptop.  It just won't work properly.Some of these shortcomings make me wonder whether Logitech's free version of its web based services will remain free for the reasonable life of the cameras.  And what will customers do when Logitech stops providing the service, whether free or for a premium?  Regardless, even the premium services are something the camera itself or the control software could and should do for free, as Panasonic has demonstrated.

I hoped that one of the MANY Logitech updates would fix this.  Yeah, no.2. There isn't an \"always on\" feature.  In other words, you are hostage to the motion sensing capability of the camera.

There are several things to consider when purchasing this unit that you might want to take into consideration. Here is how it works, more or less.The camera uses flat ethernet cables to plug into a homeplug system that give it power. Depending on how old your house is and how good your wiring is, is going to determine the how well the camera software can view the camera itself. It comes with a small 2 gig sdcard (the really tiny ones) and depending on how much traffic you are getting, you might get a couple of days of traffic on it before it will start overwriting the older videos on it. You can add larger mem cards up to 32gig I believe.If you are wanting to keep these recordings, your best bet is to setup a computer dedicated to just viewing and recording the camera(s). In the software you can set how much space you want to use or how long you want to store the videos. The software is pretty simple to use and lacks a lot of features that a more sophisticated setup would have. There is no scheduling of any sort, so if you wanted this to not record during the day but wanted it to record at night, your only options are to live with it recording all the time or to go in and change it every evening and every morning for its recording options. They may put that feature in at some point, but after many months and a few revisions of the software, many of us are still waiting to see these added features.Another thing to keep in mind with this setup is that whatever socket you plug the power adapter into, the main homeplug that allows it to have access to your network also has to be on the same circuit in your house. this means if you have a barn or storage shed that happens to be on a different breaker box, you can forget having the software to find it. It has to be on the same circuit. These things also do not do well being run from power strips. They cause interference and can make your video go in and out in the software. The camera itself will still record, but your ability to view and retrieve it can be hampered by those power strips.Pros:Nice video, can see things clearly.Has a very wide viewing angle. If you looked at the camera, you would never guess that it could catch someone from such an angle.Does have a zoom function for live viewing (digital)The software, while simple, does do the job. But is missing many needed features such as scheduling and time stamping.Have had mine since August of 2011 and have not really had many problems with it at all.Will record motion on all cameras and if you have a dedicated system to run the software, it will copy them all onto your machine.Cons:There a bunch of cons but keep in mind for its price, its kind of expectedVideo is stated at 15fps. However, that is ZOOMED in fps. If you have it at full wide angle, it is around 10fps. This can be a huge problem for some folks.Night IR mode is much worse. around 5fps for fully zoomed out video. Very poor for identification if they continually move around as they will just be a bit of a blur.Software lacks many features such as scheduling and time stamping the videos.Audible alerts in the software sometimes just quit working. You usually have to go into its configuration and turn it off then back on for it to start alerting you again.It will continue to record anything going on despite the audible alert not functioning during this time.Email alerts are 100% dependent on logitechs service being up. If their service is down, you will not get email alerts.Logitechs web service is up and down a lot. When its down, it can be down for a few hours or more than a day. It can be frustrating if you are highly dependent on using it vs using the software that came with the system. To me, this part of their service still needs a major overhaul. Right now, you simply can't count on the system being up. It can be up for a week with no issues then be down for a day and then the next week it can be intermittent on you being able to connect and see your cameras. All of this can be ignored if you are only using the pc software and aren't needing to remotely view your cameras.Even with those cons, I still enjoy the product. I rarely ever need to view my cameras from away and sadly the times I wanted to view them, I couldn't, because their service was down or having intermittent problems.To me, I am a cheapskate at heart. I feel for the price it should do more but I do understand the tech behind it and can understand its limits for what it costs. Besides that, I am still giving it 4 stars for use in a home setting. It does do its basic job of recording motion well, even to well in many cases. The daytime video is very clear even at 10fps. Night time video could be improved by very good lighting but if you are dependent on the IR, then expect low frame rates and a video that lets you know someone set it off, but the chances of you identifying someone from it at night may be slim.To give a short demonstration of the video it captures at max angle. I have included a day time video with a cat walking across the driveway and a night time video with a possum walking up the ramp. You will notice the blur in the night video due to its low frame rate. Keep in mind this video will be compressed and whatnot on amazon so the quality is actually better than it looks but the frame rate issues can still be seen.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "A lot to like, but not a reliable solution", "Author": "El Chango", "ReviewID": "R1NSUIPX63OML0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Installation was a breeze: install the latest software, attach a few color-coded cables, and connect to home AC power. Everything came up immediately. Nice interface. I liked it so much, I was planning on adding more cameras to cover additional areas outside my home.However, over the 3 days I have had this device in use, it has only been up about half the time - constantly losing connection with the camera. I've tried resetting the camera, unplugging power, trying different AC outlets, rebooting my computer, etc. No matter what I have tried, the monitor software usually loses the camera connection within 15 minutes.The idea to use the home's AC power lines for the connection to the camera has a lot of appeal. However, these wires were never designed for data. All kinds of devices such as refrigerators, washers, dryers, TV's, florescent lights, etc. are all pumping noise into the circuit. I think that may be the reason I was having so much difficulty. I'm returning it and looking for something more reliable.", "Date": "March 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "I like it but I have some concerns", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R290MJLFFCKGEI",

This was a couple of days after I got my camera.  It freaked me out so bad I brought several others.  I have 5 cameras.Below is my review but first I would like to update it now 14 months into having the cameras.  Twice my cameras went offline and they had to be reset.  I have my cameras mounted on the eaves of my house and there is no way to get to them without using an extension ladder.  I made it inconvienant for a thif to be able to get to them and consequently it is hard for me also.  I went without cameras for a couple of months because they went off line and it was too cold and the cameras were too high for me to get to.  I had to pay someone. I found that since I purchased the cameras no tech support is available after 7 PM, you can write but it will take a few days to get a response.  I stopped paying the commander price because to me it should be free. Nothing is stored on Logitechs servers...at least its not supposed to be.  If I had to do it all over again I would buy Swann - 8-Channel, 8-Camera Indoor/Outdoor Surveillance System in Best buy for $480.  I had a friend purchase the Swann setup the same time I got mine and he has had ZERO problems with his.  I feel like I wasted my money on these cameras because I don't feel secure with them.  If you read other reviews I am not the only one who had problems.  They cost too much money to throw out and start over so I am stuck.  I need two more camera and I will get a different brand.  I am done with these waste of money cameras.  Oh yeah and you have to have a router to view the video feeds online or on your computer.  Not a hotspot but a hardwired Internet connection.Here is my review I wrote when I first got the cameras:PROS:* The system was easy to set up.  plug in and you are done (update: unless the cameras go offline...be prepared to climb the ladder and make sure you have a mini screwdriver and paper clip with you)* The picture is VERY clear.  with the interior camera you have to have light on when the room is dark in order to see anything because they only work in lit areas....the exterior cameras are normal color in the day and b/w at night or in low light/dark situations* The video feed is very good quality and clear as heck.(update but not if you have an indoor camera pointing out the window....you won't see jack at night)* You can set the camera up to send you alerts and this is very handy if you have email that goes to your cellphone, even handier if you also have Internet access on your phone.  From the software go to settings and alerts.  In there you can check the box to send you alerts.  What happens now is you get an email that says you have some activity and in the email is a snapshot of what set the camera off.  If it looks like something you want to check out then there is a link that will take you to the specific feed for that alert on the Internet.  Very cool. (update: but you can't review anything but a live feed if you don't pay the annual $80 fee)* the interior camera is great for monitoring the kids.  I have it mounted on the ceiling so they cant reach it and when they are in the room they constantly look at the camera, so it helps modify their behavior.* You get to see what is going on around your property when you are not home.  Just go to youtube and search for surveillance and you will see lots of videos where people recorded surprising things. (update: unless they steal your camera...then the video is gone for good)* You can map out areas in the photo where you want the motion detector to react BUT you have to do it in squares and rectangles not round or freestyle areas.Cons:* If you catch action close to the camera you cannot decipher a face clearly.  Having a little distance between the proposed subject and the camera works better. i put my camera by my door on the eaves about 4' away and that is good...  originally it was 2' away and all I got was blurs. You can always put the cameras far away and zoom in if you want to always record closeups.* Sometimes normal walk speed close to the camera makes you catch a blurrrr instead of a person so I wish the camera had the ability to playback in slow motion. (update: you can slow the video feed down by adjusting the controls on the circle around the play button)*  If you point an interior camera outside you are only going to get a good picture in the day.  At night forgetaboutit.  Keep that in mind when deciding interior vs exterior.  The ads say you can use an indoor camera and point it outside.  I found that if the cameras are for outside use you should only buy outdoor cameras.  I had to replace one of my indoor cameras for an outdoor because I could not see anything at night.  I would recommend ALL nightvision cameras even if they are going to be in the house.* The camera(s) records and stores all motion triggered activity no matter  if you have the PC on or off,, ON THE CARD in the camera.  Key words in that sentence is \"on the card in the camera\".*  I have concerns about the security.  If someone snatches the camera down and they take the camera they have also taken all video proof.  No way to recover it unless it is saved on your computer and your computer has to be on at all times for it to download to the computer.*  To review and save all recorded activity you must start the PC. You can't leave the computer on to wake when there is some activity (to record it) because it won't wake the computer.  Someone said you can access it from work by using LogMeIn.  I will not do that because then everything on your computer will get backed up on your work's servers as soon as you log into logmein from the job.  I don't have anything to hide, it's just a matter of privacy. I don't want my job having access to video feeds in and outside of my house.*  All cameras have to be on the same line in the electrical circuit breaker box.  usually not a problem but in older homes where the house has been added on and have more than one box.  That's a problem.* You can back everything up to the \"cloud\" but it only saves a day worth of video and you have to have the computer on for it to synch to the cloud.  To save more than a day's worth you have to pay and I think the price is a bit steep.  Logitech should give you a weeks worth of storage with the commander free.  I pay $70 a year just to review and I can't save anything???  Not cool Logitech. And there should also be some way to save the video feeds remotely.  Every time an alert goes out it should record the whole episode to the cloud. Oh and with the free cloud they offer you...it will not save an entire days worth of feeds so if you have any activity that goes beyond the free storage is deleted and therefor lost.* You have to click every single option in the commander software to know what you can and can not do (including clicking advanced).  I can see by the reviews that this is an issue because several people complain about not being able to do certain things and the options to do so are there. (ie adjusting the sensitivity, turning on the microphones, getting email alerts)* There is a date and time stamp on the video feed but it is hard to decipher without looking real close.  For instance my feeds say: BACKDECK_2011-11-25T10:43:16.351096-05:00  I deciphered from that the camera location, date, time and the video was 16 seconds long.  not sure of the rest.*  You can not add other cameras other than Logitech Alert cameras to the system and use them with the included Alert Commander software.  I have one other camera that I wanted to integrate and it wouldn't pick up in the software, and when I called, Logitech tech support said it can not be done.  I tried downloading the Blue Iris software as suggested by another reviewer and it picked up my non logitech camera only. I gave up.  Not even worth the frustration!!HINTS:*  Read all the reviews as there is a lot of helpful information in here.*  If you see anything you want to save make sure you move that video feed segment into another folder.  You have to go to my computer to do this.  at the top of the feed is the date and time and you will have to go into the folder for that camera and find it.  The file names correspond to the date and time.  Don't make the saved clips folder in the camera folder or else it will count towards your storage space.  I saved mines under the Logitech folder*  After you set up everything check out the email alerts, review video clips from your phone, go the the alert website and log in, check out things from there also.  The last thing you want is to find out you don't know how to log in when you get an alert you want to check out.  Make sure everything is set up correctly and avoid a panic attack later.  LOL*  Also AFTER your cameras are set up, go to settings/security/advanced and click on secure local camera network and put in a password.  why?  well if you have an unscrupulous friend/jealous mate/nosey neighbor/or whatever they can download the Logitech software and if they are in range of your computer network they can wirelessly access your feeds and download them to their computer.  In other words all they have to do is start the software on their laptop and all of your feeds will go to their computer.  thats not cool at all.*  All of my exterior cameras had to be reset within a few days of being set up.  If you see a red light on the bottom of the camera and it is either not saving the feeds or has a really crappy signal you have to take the camera down unplug the network cable, stick a pin in the hole, hold it for a few seconds and give it about 5 minutes for it to reset.  I would not put the back screws back in until I was sure it was working.  Its a pain to screw, unscrew,screw, unscrew,screw, unscrew,.  You get the picture.  I had to do this once for each of my cameras and had no problems since.*  Make sure you record the serial numbers of all your cameras.  I took a photo of the serial numbers with my cell phone and saved them to my computer under the name of the camera, then emailed the photos to myself.  If I am talking to tech suppoert and they ask me for the serial number I don't have to unmount the camera to get it, if my camera gets stolen I have the serial number to give to the police, if my computer gets stolen, I have the serial number photos in my email.*  I read where people said they wanted to hide their cameras around their property and I thought that was a good idea as well but I changed my mind on that.  Why? Because when people know you have a camera on the property that knowledge is a big deterrent.  I noticed that no one wants to be on camera.. I put the stickers by the front and back doors, on a no trespassing sign as you come on my property and on a no trespass sign at the back of my property.  It has worked better than a fence.  Also it is very clear and so I did not have to buy Logitech's $30 signs they want to sell you.  Alarm companies give you a yard sign for free and Logitech should also give you one if you buy 3 or more cameras!Would I recommend this system to anyone else?  no I have a friend who owns the Swann system sold by Bestbuy and he loves it.  The biggest advantage Logitech has over it is that it is plug and play and wireless.  (you can have someone set up a wired system by having all the wires in the attic and the cameras mounted on the house eaves.  The advantage Swan has is that it is constantly recording and if you have a break-in they have to find the dvr and take it in order to steal the video... you don't have to have a router, and you don't have to constantly reset the cameras by climbing the ladders to get to them.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not Worth The Money - Has Known Issues", "Author": "J. Rehm", "ReviewID": "R12GN7SUAP54W7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The 700e is not the system you might believe it to be.  It has issues with motion detection that Logitech knows about and has been reported by other purchasers.  In most cases it will detect motion, but is unreliable at recording the entire event regardless of sensitivity level.  For instance, I setup several tests under various lighting conditions and in each case it would start recording at the first sign of movement, but then would not continue to record.  One person posted in the Logitech forum that their system captured some thieves entering the area and leaving, but did not record anything in between when they were actually doing the stealing.  My tests showed similar results.There are also no provisions for time lapse recording or continuous recording, both of which would be important and welcome features.The camera requires an electrical outlet to operate, so unless you are willing to install outlets high up on the side of your house or buy the extra long cables from Logitech if installing these outside under eaves I would stay away from this system.  It would not be a good idea to install outlets in your attic and plug the power supply into those outlets simply because you wouldn't know if there was a fire until it was too late.  The documentation shows running the cable from the camera down the side of the house to an outside outlet mounted on the lower portion of the house.  Very easy for a would be intruder or thief to simply cut the cable disabling the camera if you were to install in this manner.The camera does appear to be well built and the images produced are of good quality, even in total darkness.  But this is not enough to justify the price.  A better value in my mind is the Samsung SDE series, which is a much more capable system for the same or less money than you would end up spending to install the poorly functioning Logitech system with the same number of cameras that come with the Samsung system.", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Inconsistent -- but still improving?", "Author": "Carl R", "ReviewID": "R3SVYGBI9CTWCU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "INITIAL REVIEW: After doing a lot of research (so I thought), I purchased the outdoor system.  Once I unpackaged it, I had it up and showing video images on my PC within 15 minutes, and had web and phone access (the free stuff) working in only 5 more minutes.  Other than not being able to set time frames on the alarms, I love everything about this product!  The initial system worked so well that I bought another outdoor camera and an indoor one.  Adding them was another piece of cake.  It may be a bit pricey, but the merchandise is high-quality.  My whole experience with it has been positive.UPDATE1: Six weeks later, the honeymoon is over.  Unexpectedly, the indoor and outdoor camera started to not be available much on my Droid phone.  Then they became never available.  Then the Logitech Alert web viewer quit seeing my cameras.  Resetting a camera gives me one more viewing, but then they are unavailable again the next time.  The downhill slide has taken about a week to reach this point.UPDATE2: Soon after I wrote UPDATE1, the response time and success rate of the internet and phone-viewing suddenly became dramatically improved... better than it had been when new!  What explains this?  Dunno -- could be Logitech's server, my Verizon connection, flakey hardware?  So I bumped the product rating up to 3 stars.  They'll get 4 if this holds out for a few weeks.  But right now, I get my live feed super quickly and consistently.UPDATE3: The last month has been a good one: zero at-home failures (even after automatic resets due to summer storm power outages!), a near 100% success rate getting a live feed over the internet, and about 80% success with live phone-viewing.  And when there is a remote-viewing connection problem, it is gone less than an hour later.SUMMARY: Maybe Logitech wrung out some bugs or got more/better servers, or maybe Verizon, as my ISP, did something to improve things, but overall I'm happy with this system -- unlike the way I was a month ago.  If it didn't have that earlier weirdness, I'd give it 5 stars.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Here's the best way to setup these cameras - no need for power outlets", "Author": "Josh", "ReviewID": "R377V4GIS2ISL4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are a ton of reviews here so I won't repeat everything about the system itself, but here is the absolute best way to setup these cameras:1.

Connect the PoE switch to a free port on your router, and plug the power connection into the UPS.4. Run network cable from the new PoE switch through your attic, basement, etc. to each location where you want to mount a camera (drop it down through the ceiling for ceiling mount, through the soffit panels for exterior undermount, into a standard RJ45 jack enclosure if you want to just sit the camera on a shelf inside, etc.). Use bulk network cable for this and simply crimp the RJ45 ends on the cable at each end (or for a more professional setup terminate the cables into a patch panel near the PoE switch).5. Connect each camera to your remote cable location using only the network port on the camera (no need to use power adapters, in fact when you purchase additional cameras Logitech now sells versions that don't include the powerline network adapters. These sell for significantly less too!)6. Use the software as specified to configure the cameras... you're done!This setup allows you to easily place cameras anywhere in your house with no need to run bulky (and potentially dangerous) AC wiring or extension cords. The cameras are connected straight to your network for maximum reliability. Since the PoE switch is the only source of power, and since it is connected to your UPS, then all the cameras will continue to record even if the power goes out. Since your router and modem are also connected to the UPS you will still be able to monitor your cameras remotely when the power is out as well.", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent system with great customer support", "Author": "R. A. Cook \"The Professor\"", "ReviewID": "R10MRQOTTV6Y7X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought and installed this system with three exterior cameras and one internal camera.  I've had it up and running for a few days now.  Things work well.  I have a few comments which may help users:Each camera attaches by a very thin wire to a blocky power adapter.  The power adapter provides power to the cameras and takes digital information from the camera and sends it over your power lines to another blocky network adapter that then hooks up to your router.  I took the time to route the thin wires into my attic and other crawlspaces so that the cameras would be less obvious and less vulnerable to tampering.  The thin lines that come with the external cameras are nice and long (20'?) the ones that come with the internal cameras are short (10'?) but you are given a double female device for easily extending the line with a 3rd party network cable.  Burying the lines worked well for me and my installation looks clean.One of my external cameras is on my barn pointed toward the house.  This camera is attached to a long line of house wiring.  It goes from the camera, to the barn attic, through maybe 50' of 12AWG wire to the remote breaker panel in the barn, through about 100' of 8AWG wire to the main service entrance (the main fuse box), and then back through another 30' or so of 12AWG to the network adapter and the computer.  When you run the diagnostics that come with the Logitech system, it indicates that this camera is indeed a long way away and not optimal.  That being said, the camera works just fine though I do notice it takes longer to download the files from the camera to the computer.When I attached the fourth camera, I began to have issues losing signals from some of the cameras that had worked properly.  I unplugged and replugged adapters but couldn't get it all working.  I called the tech support lines, didn't have to wait at all, got a nice guy from Canada who told me what to do and who gave me a case number.  I did what he said (unplug everything, leave it unplugged for a while, then replug everything).  It all came up and has been working flawlessly since.My hat is off to the Logitech engineers.  They paid a lot of attention to details that make a big difference but probably go unnoticed by most.  In no particular order:- All the screws are captive.  If you are up on a ladder and back out the screws to attach the wires, the screws won't fall out of the box and get lost in the grass.  Nice.- The weather protection on the external cameras is very well thought out.- You have lots of control over the motion detection, both the areas that trigger an alert as well as the sensitivity.- The physical mounting systems are excellent and quite adaptable.  Strong and secure.- The field of vision is very wide angle and takes in a cone a full 45 degrees off the main line of sight axis.  If you mount the camera under an eve in an inside corner of the building, you can see both walls and everything within that 90 degree sweep.  (It's like an MC Escher print.)- The night vision (only on the exterior cameras) works well.  Of course, it's still a low light situation, so you will get blurry images of moving objects.- Everything comes nicely packaged with good instructions and more parts than you'll probably need.- Viewing on a Droid phone works well, though things are, of course, a bit slower to load up and jumpy on playback.- Each camera comes with a 2 GB micro-SD card and each camera comes with an adapter so you can read the card on most computers.  (16 GB cards are now easy to get for about $14.  I ordered replacements.)- Motion sensing works exceptionally well.  Initially, my cameras were triggered by cars passing only just barely visible on a distant roadway and by headlights shining from afar on my building.Finally, I would spend some time each day initially to fiddle with the motion alert windows and settings.  Get them so they don't trigger during the day or at night unless there's a good reason.  That way, when you do want the alerts to come to your smartphone, you won't be bombarded by them.I'm very pleased with the system and hope I eventually find it wasn't really necessary years from now.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lots to Like, a Couple of Ehhhhhs", "Author": "Brian D. Newby", "ReviewID": "RD8V38QSLEGHZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have the previous camera product made by Logitech, then Wilife, bought by Logitech a few years ago.  For the most part, this is a major upgrade.So, first, if you have no background into the old system, I can't compare this new product to others like it, but there are a few companies that make the same kind of cameras.  My only insight into those is one that required your camera to be by your router, and this system doesn't require that.  The initial power device--central command, really, but it's just a big plug the size of your fist--is connected to the router, though.The setup is pretty easy, but a little intimidating when you first open the box because it looks like a lot of work--units, cables, a CD--but following the directions on the quick start-guide is pretty straightforward.  The picture quality in the daytime is very good and I really like the iPad app that lets me see the cameras live.On face-value then, it sort of works okay to pretty well.  But bringing the baggage of the previous unit is important, I think.First, the night vision on the outdoor camera isn't as good as the previous system, and, in fact, it's not very good.  It's pretty good if you have a light on outside, but pure darkness, not so much and as it gets dark in the afternoon (around 4), the color quality turns to black and white.One issue I had with the previous system was that the power units would occasionally stop working.  Sometimes, they'd stop for good.  Other times, they'd stop at my office and I'd bring it home (I have a system at each place) and it would work there.  Then, I'd take it back to my office and it would magically start working again.These units feel different, a little more solid.  But as I went to hang up the power unit for the outdoor camera, one of the two screw holders snapped off and obviously had just been hotglued to the main unit.  Knowing the quality issues of the past, this is a bit of a red flag, especially when you consider how crazily expensive the cameras are.  And, in my opinion, the cost could be diminished if they were packaged smarter--easily $25 of the cost goes just for the packaging.When I hooked up the new system, I still had my old cameras and it found them and updated the firmware.  \"Sweet!,\" I thought, because I started thinking I could augment the old cameras with the new ones.  That was the extent of the compatibility, though.  I haven't yet tried to see if a new camera will be found by my old system (so maybe I could go version 1 at home and version 2 at the office, for instance), but I don't think it will--I will update if I find out differently.But the old system had a way I could log in and view all my systems and the new app only works with the new system.  Hence, the baggage issue because I've spent $2,000 on old units and $1,000 on new ones and they might as well been from two different companies (they sort of were with the Logitech buyout).  So, my biggest thought, if you are starting from scratch, is to be very cautious with any system you buy if you think it can be expanded or compatible with other systems later.  And, further, because of the issues I've had with the previous system and a very minor issue already with this one, I'd think hard before I plopped down $2,000 for a full system here thinking you were covered forever.These could very well be the best--they were when I bought the first system and I'm kind of invested in this route.  The wireless aspect is something they've got down cold.  If I judged this on software, I'd give it 4.5 stars (5 if it combined systems), but on hardware, probably a 3, and pricing, a 2 at best.  Priced 50 percent below what they are, and these would be perfect.  At this price point, explore all alternatives before you pull the trigger.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good solid video surveillance", "Author": "Dave Leonard", "ReviewID": "RTL2L8CD31EJQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My daughter had a little problem with \"friends\" toilet-papering our house every weekend (yeah, pretty much every weekend), so I was looking for a reasonable quality, easy to install, low light capable video system.

Since then, 4 weeks later, no TP events.  Amazing how word spreads in the high school.  System is very easy to install and configure, with a very good daylight picture.  Low light picture is blurry when there is movement, probably due to slow frame speed on the camera.  I'm buying a faster SD card to see if that helps.

In 2010, shipping a consumer product that doesn't support the Mac is a bad idea. This isn't 1996; the Mac is a major consumer platform, and not supporting it is simply lazy.- No WiFi support. The 750e utilizes ethernet over powerlines. While in some ways this makes sense (after all, you have to plug the cameras in) it needlessly limits the range of the cameras. WiFi support would have allowed for much wider flexibility as to where the cameras could be placed.- PC video driver bugs. Camera video feeds and recordings could not be played on my (very standard) PC. In place of video feeds were grey boxes. A perusal of the Logitech forums indicated that this was a known issue with a wide variety of video cards and drivers. Luckily, I was able to get the software to work properly on a secondary PC, but your mileage may vary.- Exaggeration of the pan and zoom features. The box said the camera could pan and zoom. This is not really true - the pan and zoom are entirely digital; basically, the camera can change the focus within the digital frame, but the physical camera doesn't seem to move around to give you a truly wide field of motion, nor does there seem to be an optical zoom. The field of view is wide enough that for the most part this isn't an issue in normal use, but those expecting optical zoom and a wide (physical) field of motion will be disappointed.Now the good- The low light performance of the camera is excellent. I was able to get \"bright as day\" video even in nighttime lighting with no ambient lights (not even streetlights).- The remote access is very nice. You can view real-time video over the web or via and iPhone, which is really neat. Additionally, the cameras output video in standard RTSP streams, which the knowledgeable user can access using a variety of software to make their own monitoring solutions.- The commander software, while PC only (and finicky with your video card) is really nice when it works. You can automatically download motion-triggered video recordings, listen to audio, and monitor multiple cameras at one. The command center software is very powerful, and I hope Logitech enhances it and fixes the bugs.- The cameras are physically solid. The outdoor camera has so far survived fall weather conditions in Kansas, although it does seem to need shelter from direct exposure to rain.Overall, Logitech has a decent \"1.0\" product here. It's probably a worthwhile purchase, especially if you find it on sale, and the major flaws are all software based, meaning that they can all be fixed without needing new hardware.

But I wouldn't buy it again - not in its present stage of development.The problem is in its motion sensing, for triggering email alerts.  It mistakes rain and snow falling across its field of view as motion that merits an email alert.  This problem is particularly acute at night, when the infrared illuminators are activated, and snow flakes and raindrops passing in front of the camera are brightly illuminated and appear as meteor-like streaks in the field of view.  Some nights I have a hundred or more false alarms.  (The problem occurs also in daytime, but only by the dozens.)Several users on the tech support forum (forums<dot>logitech<dot>com - Security Cameras - Alert; search 'snow') have complained about this issue.  Logitech has responded repeatedly, saying that they're aware of the issue and are working on a downloadable software update that will address the situation.  Before Christmas they forecast delivery of the update by the end of December.  But it hasn't yet been released, and now they aren't forecasting a release date.  (They report it will be a major upgrade, with lots of other features, but they no longer are committing to when it will be delivered - probably a wise move in view of their difficulty in getting something worthy of release.)If and when the upgrade is released, and if it works, the product will be a gem.  (And my indoor cameras have worked flawlessly.)  But if you live anywhere but in a desert, and if email alerts are of interest to you, and if you're considering the outdoor camera (e.g., the Logitech Alert 750e or 750i), I think you'll be disappointed.Below follows some technical info and musings - which may not be of interest to most folks, but I offer them for what they're worth.The system sends an email alert when motion is detected.  The existing product already includes several parameters that you can tune to help reduce false alerts.  (But, as indicated by my experiences, and those of other users, they don't cope adequately with rain/snow.)One feature is that the product allows you to draw numerous rectangular sub-regions in the field of view, within which the sensed motion must occur in order to be considered for an alert.  Thus, if the field of view includes your driveway and a public street, you can draw a rectangle on the driveway part of your screen, which doesn't extend into the street.  The system only monitors the user-defined sub-regions.  (Or, the user can specify that the whole image frame should be monitored.)Another is that the product has a control that allows you to adjust how long motion must be detected before an alert is sent, e.g., 1 second, 2 seconds, etc.  The higher the number, the less frequently a qualifying motion is sensed.  (But the higher the number, the more frequently a \"false negative\" event occurs, i.e., a motion that *should* merit an email alert - such as a person walking across the field of view - but doesn't.A further parameter is a \"sensitivity\" control - a slider bar that lets you set a value between 1 and 100.  The lower the number, the less frequently a qualifying motion is sensed.  (But, the lower the number, the more frequently \"false negatives\" again occur.)A final parameter is a time interval within which the system won't send a further alert.  This is typically set to 3 or 5 minutes, and ensures that false alarms don't recur at a rate of thousands per hour.  Once one alert has been sent, that camera won't send another alert until after the specified interval has elapsed.Now I delve into suppositions - not fact.  I think the product encodes imagery using a DCT-based image compression - like that used in JPEG.  I suspect the image is segmented into square tiles, e.g., 8x8 or 16x16 pixels, transformed into the spatial frequency domain, and the resulting coefficients then represented by Huffman-encoded tokens or the like.  In such systems, motion can be detected by monitoring the stream of resulting image data for changes in bandwidth (i.e., if there is no motion, each image frame is like the predecessor, and data is spit out at a uniform rate).  Only those tiles corresponding to the user-defined sub-regions of the frame would be monitored for changes in bandwidth.In such a system, the \"sensitivity\" control can simply set a threshold value against which sudden changes in data stream bandwidth are judged.  If the threshold is exceeded, the system can conclude that sufficient change in imagery has occurred to send an alert.Such an arrangement does not attempt to analyze the image contents, e.g., whether the change in imagery that causes the data stream bandwidth to hiccup is due to harmless trails of snow blowing across the IR-illuminated field of view, or a real threat.There are better ways to do this.  Rain and snow trails appear as elongated traces - relatively long regions with two closely spaced edges.  (The traces are not always straight, as the wind can blow them into wild arcs...)  Each frame of imagery can be analyzed for long edges using known techniques.  Pixel regions bounded by closely-spaced long edges can be flagged as potential rain/snow streaks, and can be replaced with corresponding imagery from the same location in an immediately preceding frame.  This would effectively remove such streaks so that they wouldn't trigger a change in bandwidth, thereby avoiding an alarm.There are many other such image discrimination techniques that might be applied.  Logitech's business, however, historically has been in mice and computer peripherals.  Thus, its technical staff probably doesn't have much background in image processing from which it can draw.The product is potentially a good one.  I hope they are hiring some suitably-expert image processing/object recognition consultants (or employees) so that this product can soon reach its potential.  Until then, I'm afraid it's the \"boy who cried wolf\" run amok.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Monitoring System - Recommended", "Author": "C.

security over your existing AC wiring. This is a very feature rich set that provides a lot of options for both home and business use. Here are my observations:Setup -1) Install the PC software (ours is on an Compaq Laptop running 64-bit Vista)2) Plug HomePlug powerline adapter into wall socket and connect to router with included Ethernet Cable3) Plug HomePlug camera power supply into wall socket and connect to camera with included Ethernet Cable4) PC software will detect the camera, check firmware versions of camera and HomePlug units and update if neededPros -+ Easy Setup; we had this fully operational within a half hour of opening the box+ Real Time Monitoring; \"Alert Commander\" PC software displays live images (very slight delay) and can alert for detected motion via \"pop-up\" (see my video) and\\or email+ Excellent Image Quality; both day and night vision are very clear, even in total darkness (see my video)+ Supports Sound; very clear audio, but warns you to check local laws before enabling+ Records; both to the camera and to the PC (optional)+ Phone Viewing; free app allows for remote viewing of all cameras on the system (see my video)+ View from Web; able to view all of your locations and cameras via any web browser (basic is free, advanced is extra but haven't needed to try it)Cons -- Even at the lowest settings it detects rain as motion and will generate \"alert\" emails, if configured- Camera goes into \"Night Vision\" mode even if only slightly overcastMisc -* HomePlug powerline network adapters are compatible with Brite-View 200 Mbps Digital Home Powerline Ethernet Adapters included 1-port Bridge & 4-port Switch, so it did not interfere with my existing network* Logitech Tech Support (based out of Canada) was very helpful in diagnosing and replacing a defective add-on cameraThis is a very good system and was so impressed that I bought extra cameras for my home and installed a master system in my wife's small business as well.Recommended!CFH", "Date": "March 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome picture but have to babysit cameras", "Author": "Lake Rat", "ReviewID": "R106TXG7XFIVUN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought these to use on our truck scales at a stone quarry.

One unit was dead on arrival (when you 1st power it, the two red LEDs are on during daylight and they go off and the red motion LED and the LED next to microphone come on) and this routine didn't happen (the unit was also extremely hot to touch).  The 2nd unit worked fine during daylight but at night it looked like having something in front of its lens (or maybe the two red LEDs weren't putting out enough light), so the picture was not clear compared to my 750e.  I called the Logitech tech support few times and they were useless.I shipped the two units back separately for replacement.  3rd unit came back with the same night vision issue, then I got a 4th unit which behaved like the 1st unit (DOA).  I am now waiting for more replacements.Logitech software is extremely poorly written.  It takes the Commander 1-2 hours to download the videos captured in last 24 hours. The Commander also downloads the most recent videos first. This means that if I want to look at the videos from 23 hours ago, I have to wait for the Commander to download the most recent videos first, from the past 22 hours. In addition, during playback, it doesn't jump over blank areas and it counts the seconds down from one video-to-blank area-to-another-video (extremely stupid and wasting user's time). I like the wide angle lens, colors, and the idea behind the SD card but it should also allow saving automatically to a NAS or a FTP server (or let user to access the SD card via a file manager).  Overall, I still recommend this camera over my other IP cameras (Panasonic and Sharx).

But if you read my review from a year ago at http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Outdoor-Add-On-Security-Camera/dp/B003X26LYQ/ref=cm_cr-mr-title?tag=acleint-20 you'll see that I've been using this camera family already, paid for.  I had five cameras in my system since last year, all ones I paid for.  Obviously I'm not just giving a good review because it was free as so many claim the Vine reviewers do...Arrived and was packaged just like all the others on my system (now have a total of three external and three internal).  Since I had the Commander software already running, the only thing I needed to do was plug the camera in.  Immediately my Commander software found the unit, added it to my list, and allowed me to name it appropriately.  Also it was then showing up on the website as well as on my iPhones and iPads.  It simply couldn't get any simpler than that.The unit looks similar to the previous indoor non night vision version, with the exception of a different opening for the Microphone and the emitter for the night vision.  Otherwise the size and shape are pretty much identical.  The external cameras used a different method (software algorithm) to determine when they should shift to night vision mode, which sometimes gives you a camera that switches back and forth a could times during sunset when it's right on the verge, but these handle things differently.  There's an actual ambient light sensor to get, in Logitech's words, \"...a more accurate detection of when to switch.\"  And it worked well.  On my 6 camera system, at sundown, two of the three external systems switched from night vision back to daytime operation, then to night vision, a couple times over the course of a 15 minute period or so, but these indoor ones with night vision did not switch on me at all.  Once it was on, they stayed on even when I had a little variation in lighting in nearby rooms or halls that didn't directly impact the rooms they were in.Set up is easy for the first timer, but I'll refer to the link to my review on the external camera review since I went into a LOT of detail about the process there already.Detail is amazing as all of these have had so far.  Several times dealing with the police due to the idiots I live nearby, the police were always amazed at the quality of the videos I could provide compared to what they normally see.  And comparing this to a \"professionally\" installed system we use at work that we purchased from a company that does nothing but security cameras, there's no comparison.  I've shown the web commander as well as the IOS viewer to several of my clients and they're all looking at getting the same system now, simply because it *is* so easy to get up and running with no extra wiring or drilling or anything.  So it's ideal for places with older walls or ceilings that are tougher to run cables through.The amount of detail available at night is stunning when you see it for the first time.  And since the range is greater than most people will need (about 50 feet) for interior use, you're pretty sure to have a great field of view even in the darkness.My cameras came already updated with current firmware, as did the bricks that plug into the wall, so my system had no need of any updates.  As all do, it comes with a 2GB MicroSD card so it will hold a history of what you've had it set to capture.  I dump all six of my cameras to my Mac Mini Windows 7 Media Center PC since it's running 24/7 and that way I don't have to worry about space.For someone with kids, pets, or an elderly parent they want to be able to keep an eye on from time to time, this is a great product.  As far as the price, my initial review I linked above went into how poor my experiences were with the cheaper cameras, so at least for me it's clearly a \"you get what you pay for\" item.  And obviously I think I get a lot, since I've purchased five of these so far prior to this Vine product being offered to me.Indoor, outdoor, they just work beautifully.", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "A great system, until it breaks", "Author": "BPK", "ReviewID": "R5IGI902HIHRT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When this thing works, it works great, everything you could have hoped for.But then after a little over a year, and it wasn't in use all that time, it broke.

It takes about 5 minutes to set up each camera and it more or less does the rest* The picture is VERY clear.  with the interior camera you have to have light on of course....the exterior cameras are b/w at night with no light and look like daytime with an orangey hue if a light is on.* very good quality pictures.* If you point an interior camera outside you are only going to get a good picture in the day.  At night forgetaboutit.  Keep that in mind when deciding interior vs exterior* the interior camera great for monitoring the kids.  I have it mounted on the ceiling so they cant reach it and when they are in the room they constantly look at the camera, so it helps modify their behavior* You get to see what is going on when you are not home.* My house was rewired and some of my plugs on a different switch.  I constantly have problems with the one on a different circuit going out.  I also only have \u00bc of the signal bars so I am going to have to have some more plugs put in my house on the same circuit.* You can map out areas in the photo where you want the motion detector to react BUT you have to do it in squares and rectangles not round or freestyle areas.Cons:* If you catch action close to the camera you cannot decipher a face clearly.  Having a little distance between the proposed subject and the camera works better.* Sometimes normal walk speed close to the camera makes you catch a blurrrr instead of a person so I wish the camera had the ability to playback in slow motion.* I have concerns about the security.  If someone snatches the camera down they take the camera and all video proof.  No way to recover it unless it is saved on your computer.* The camera(s) stores all motion triggered activity regardless if you have the PC on or off ON THE CARD in the camera, To review and save all recorded activity you must start the PC. You can't leave the computer on to wake when there is some activity (to record it).  Someone said you can access it from work by using LogMeIn.  I will not do that because then everything on your computer will get backed up on your work's servers.  Trust me on that.  I don't have anything to hide, it's just a matter of privacy.* You can back everything up to the \"cloud\" but it only saves a day worth of video and you have to have the computer on for it to synch to the cloud.  To save more than a day you have to pay and I think $10 a month is steep.  Logitech should give you a weeks worth of storage with the commander.  Hell I pay $70 a year! And there should be some way to save the video feeds remotely.  Everytime an alert goes out it should record the whole episode to the cloud.* You have to click every single option in the commander software to know what you can and can not do (including clicking advanced).  I can see by the reviews that this is an issue because several people complain about not being able to do certain things and the options to do so are there. (ie adjusting the sensitivity, turning on the microphones, getting email alerts)* There is a date and time stamp on the video feed but it is hard to decipher without looking real close.  For instance my feeds say: BACKDECK_2011-11-25T10:43:16.351096-05:00  I deciphered from that the camera the location, date, time and the video was 16 seconds long.  not sure of the rest.Would I recommend it to anyone else?  Yes I would.  I would say that if the cameras are for outside use buy only outdoor cameras.  From the reviews I thought it was okay to buy indoor cameras and mount them inside the windows pointing out and that works wonderfully in the daytime but that does not work at night.  I did like the idea of mounting one of my outdoor cameras indoors because I know a thief can't snatch it unless he comes in the house.I purchased the cameras because I have only one neighbor and my house is semi-remote.  My neighbor told me that she sees people in my yard all the time when I am not home.  Since getting the camera I have found that people use my yard as a doggie park when I am at work.  No kidding!!!

We haven't had any security issues in the 10 years we've lived in our house, but last night, just a week since we installed this camera, someone broke into my wife's car (nothing of value was taken), and we got excellent video of the whole thing.  The camera is very easy to install, high-def, wide-angle, only records when there's movement (made it easy to figure out when the break-in occurred last night), you can watch the live video on your iPhone (which made the installation a whole lot easier while I was on a ladder), has infrared LED's built-in for night vision, one cable for both video and power, etc. etc.  Told our neighborhood watch group all about this camera system, along with the captured video of the perp.  Great job Logitech!Revised 07-22-11: I've changed my rating from 5 to 2 stars for one Achilles heel that I've found in this system.  The SD Card inside the camera gets corrupted from time to time, and the camera stops recording.  Even worse, there is no warning from the software until you look for recorded video and nothing has been recorded.  If you go to the Settings -> Storage -> Cameras menu, then the SD Card in question shows up with a red exclamation point on it, saying that it has an error.  Reformatting the SD Card from this menu sometimes works, but eventually the SD Card gets corrupted again after a number of days.  Here are similar complaints on the Logitech forum: [...] The biggest gripe I have is that the software doesn't proactively notify me when the SD Card fails, and that there is no way to reformat remotely when I'm on vacation, for example.", "Date": "November 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pricey but you do get what you pay for - sometimes!", "Author": "Bob J \"tarheelinva\"", "ReviewID": "R3ED599YDIP04O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Logitech definitely has refined their previous WiLife system with the new Alert system - it didn't help though that Amazon was offering/suggesting a mix of the two as add-on components - which just confused me (one would assume the \"next generation\" might be backward compatible - not!)  So I ordered the wrong mix and then discovered part of my order was from an Amazon fulfillment vendor, hence a 20% restocking fee even if I returned it new in the box.  I contacted Amazon and the promised to reimburse me if I get hit with this fee and made a note on the order - told me to refuse it and reorder... which I did... and my first camera (System) came today - add-on's are trailing and coming on Thursday... so all I have is the first one out of the box - I'll update this once the other's arrive and I get them installed.UPDATE:  No restocking fee was assessed and Amazon did call me back to insure that I was satisfied with the return to their vendor.Right out of the box, camera housing is impressive - heavy duty, solid, nothing flimsy and very sleek/futuristic looking.  You can FEEL the quality.Followed instructions, step by step and all went well until the firmware update, which it asked me if I wanted to do and of course I said yes... it has be a good thing, right?  Wrong - two hours on the phone with L1 tech support and we got no where.  After that firmware update, my system went dead - no picture and no \"blue\" light on camera or adapter.  What happened?  After I hung up with L1, waiting for L2 to call back, I remembered that the system has asked me for my security code (WEP) for my wireless.  Not thinking, I entered it and the next step was the firmware update - that's when it all went dead.What's so annoying is L1 was obviously using a cheat sheet and going through the steps - mindlessly - without listening to me or even explaining things properly (once he said 'unplug the USB from the adapter and then plug it back in\" problem is there is no USB in the adapter, it's an ethernet connection... but I digress...After hanging up I went through all the steps and settings again and this time I removed the security (WEP) code - WHALA!  My camera came back on - amazing!  In reading the confusing HELP for this setting, I still don't understand what purpose this serves, something to with using common electric connections (commercial or apartment building, for example) to provide security - HUH?  A little more clarity would have been nice.After all that aggravation - finally I had my camera up and working and I love it... the picture is clear (frame rate is a measly 15fps, not bad but should be selectable between 30 and 15, less blurry during movement.)  The wide angle is almost fisheye at maximum and you can't ask for more than that from stationary camera.  Impressive zoom and pan for 130 degrees.Discovered some cool features, like the audio list (everything from barking dogs (small and large) to a siren sound and a list of about 15 others) and ability to have camera pop up in a small window on your desktop with an alert sound (I use it as a driveway alert so I know when someone is coming up my long driveway/UPS man/Fedex - I get a head's up alert and a picture and I can quickly click on the picture and up pops the full screen... didn't know it could do that, very cool.NOTE: SD card is not a standard, it's a micro but does come with an adapter - I almost ordered a 32 GB SD standard size - glad I waited, I would have had to return that too!I like the fact that you can turn off the motion LED so it doesn't stay on and/or blink during an event and also the status LED - so these dark gray/black cameras can barely be seen at night - very cool feature.Night vision is equally impressive - I have one of those Costco floods that dims after x number of minutes to 10% so there is \"some\" light but not much - looks like daytime out there with that little bit of light - and when motion triggers the floods, the camera goes back to full color and a great picture.  IMPRESSIVE!Can't wait to get the rest of my add-on cameras - while not cheap, they do offer exceptional quality and I had I not been suckered into inserting a WEP code that didn't need to be, I would have had this camera up and running in 5 mins.  Had I just thought about it, it's not a wireless device - it's powerline ethernet, duh!  While I remain confused about that security code, I do intend to figure out what it's purpose is at some point, but do watch out for that when installing - and don't put anything in that box.Other than my installation fiasco, I would only fault this camera for one other thing and that is no way to put it on your TV - I'm not always by my computer at night and the ability to put a video feed into an input on the big screen would be nice so I can use my remote to switch or put it in PIP - I did read that the Logitech Revue (new web enabling product for HDTV's just released this week) rumor has it that it will allow a link to this sister product and if so, problem solved, although expensive ($300!)Did not order the indoor cameras - no night vision feature - for the $20 price difference, I'll pay it for a more flexible camera that can be used inside or out.  I do hope Logitech comes out with some other cool cameras, like the radio camera (nannycam) and/or other clandestine camera's (fake smoke detector, etc.)Had I not had the initial installation issue, I probably would have rated this product a 5, given it beats the competition, by a mile - yes, pricey, and yes, it still has room for improvement, but it's a quality product at a reasonable price - remember, you do get what you pay for and having been there and done that with generic Chinese cameras that were half the quality and costs about the same 6 years ago, I think they have come a long way.  Simple, sleek, straight forward design and supported (unlike some companies that sell you stuff and then have 0 interest in helping you work through all the connection issues.)Have not tried their Premium Service, not sure I would need the ability to control or playback on my Iphone - but, it can be handy for those that travel alot.I love my Logitech Harmony One remote and it's quality is first class so I had high hopes for the Logitech ALERT... but the one flaw with Logitech, in general, is their technical support - pure and simple, it sucks.  Their L1 support personnel know less than I do about these cameras - and one even admitted to me he had never really used them and only started working there a few weeks ago.  BUT THE REAL PROBLEM IS: you canNOT get to a L2 tech - three times I was promised a callback from L2, when L1 could not fix or help me with my setup issues and not once did they ever call me back - not once.  One call did result in a post to a previous on line forum question I had already posted - but Logitech seems to go out of their way to avoid dealing with their customers on this item.  Being the owner of several Logitech products, I've never had this [bad] experience w/Logitech before, but the Alert camera support personnel - well, they are a different breed of cat.  Perhaps it is because the product is so new and there are so many variables involved with setup, including things beyond their control, but still, there is a very low level of commitment to this product's support.Logitech needs to retrain their support personnel... bottom line.

I haven't seen such effective night vision camera before; I get a very clear, crisp image even in complete darkness.The software is quite comprehensive yet very easy to use.  I must say all details have been well thought out.  I can adjust image angle and zoom easily.  Also I like selecting area of the picture and adjusting it to a particular sensitivity for motion detection.  Recording, web-access and other features work real nice.  The cost of mobile commander is high though it's not an issue for me as I, personally don't need it.  Overall, I'm very happy to have this home friendly, easy set-up professional system.I'll soon buy the second set to secure the front of my house.

There have been some incidents, nothing major, but cars broken into and planters stolen from the front two of the townhouses.  I got this security camera to see what was going on and maybe get an idea of who was doing these things.  I bought this camera because of its 24 hour capabilities and HD features.  It wasn't as great as I thought it would be.  The first camera arrived and after setting it up and trying for a couple of hours to get it to work I called Logitech.  They were very nice but the third question the tech asked was what color was the light on the bottom of the camera.  What light, I asked.  It was a lamp indicating some function of the camera - no light means it's broke.  So, where was that in the installation troubleshooting guide?  Would have saved me a couple hours lost time.  So now I have to take it apart and repack it... another 45 minutes, which brings up the question of why do I, the customer, have to assemble all this stuff to start with?  So the new one arrives.  I set it up and it works right off.  For two days I look at the images to try to figure out what is going on on the street.  The problem is, everything sets it off.  Branches moving on trees, passing cars, people walking by... so you have about a million little files to look at.  You can isolate some areas from recording, but if you're not going to record the sidewalk in front of the house and the parked cars what are you going to record?  And the quality is not all that great.  One night my niece came over for dinner, rang the doorbell, and waited downstairs for the door to open.  Looking at that a couple days later I was puzzled about who it was until I remembered she had come to dinner.  The night quality was not good enough for me to recognize my own niece from about 15 feet away.Another problem was that the system would turn itself off every few days.  I was trying to figure this out when my neighbor called and said someone had taken some stuff from his car, did the new camera show anything?  I looked, but the camera had shut itself off again.I decided that was enough and packed it up and sent it back.  I got a partial refund, about 80%, because the time limit for refunds had expired but I was pleased to get rid of it.  It would probably be good for people who can isolate the area they want to protect... a door off the street, swimming pool, back gate.  It will let you know something is moving there, but nighttime identification not so much.FOLLOW UP:  Amazon gave me a full refund after I explained the problems and the delay due to the first camera being replaced.  I have no complaint with Amazon.  In fact, their customer service makes me think I should be buying their stock.", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Alert Commander Can Now Detect Cameras", "Author": "David Bower", "ReviewID": "RHI3JKUW13ON3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update December 22, 2010Well hooray, Logitech Technical Support found the source of the problem, a security setting in the Linksys BEFSR41 router. The default position for \"Filter Multicast\" is disabled, it needed to be enabled and that solved the problem. I now have both cameras and will need to go through a learning curve to see how it all works. This is pretty exciting to me in view of the hours I have spent with Logitech Technical Support trying to isolate the cause of the problem. My hat is off to Logitech Technical Support and the engineers who refused to give up on the problem! I have never seen a more dedicated bunch!I can now start using the cameras the way they are supposed to be used and will update this review as I gain impressions of the system's operation.Update December 17, 2010The long awaited update came out yesterday afternoon so I downloaded and installed it; very sadly I must report that it did not help Alert Commander detect the cameras. The software did not require an immediate restart so I let Alert Commander try and find the cameras with no success. I decided to run the diagnostic and try restarting the computer after which I let Alert Commander again try to detect the cameras; still with no success. I ran a second diagnostic and emailed both the before and after diagnostics to Logitech Technical Support; that was late yesterday afternoon and I have not hear back yet. I went ahead and purchased the Blue Iris software which has always easily detected the cameras. Logitech had mentioned a possible plan to let Alert Commander find the cameras by manually inserting their IP address but it does not appear that feature was added; or if it was, I haven't found it yet.Update November 27, 2010Logitech has notified me the engineers have found the source of the software problem and are working on a fix. If all goes well they should have a Beta version before the end of this year and have asked me to participate in testing it. I told them I would be happy to help and am now waiting on them; they said they would contact me when it was ready.I'll update this review as things develop.Update November 18, 2010I had a phone conversation yesterday with technical support; it appears even more certain that the problem is with the Alert Commander software. We tried disabling the Zone Alarm and reinstalling the software but that didn't work this time either.I had read about a competitive software package by Blue Iris that was supposed to be compatible with the Logitech cameras so I downloaded and installed a trial version and it detected both cameras with just a few settings and adjustments in the software.Logitech is aware of this and technical support has gone back to the engineers for more answers; I'll keep you informed when I hear back from Logitech.Update November 16, 2010Well this is getting exciting now; technical support had me download and install a VLC media player and once installed had me enter some specified information and voila, the camera showed up on my computer. I must admit I was excited to finally see the camera working on my computer.According to technical support this eliminated the other components and pointed the finger of blame directly at the Alert Commander software. They are going back to the engineers with this information and will get back with me later. For the record, I have uninstalled Alert Commander and informed Logitech that I would wait on reinstallation until they informed me they had corrected software to download.Logitech told me the cameras could not see the internet because they had received faulty software and that software could not be updated until we could connect the cameras to Alert Commander. There appears to be no other way for the consumer to update the camera software.As for me, I felt any sign of progress was encouraging and even exciting. I'll keep you informed as things develop.Update November 12, 2010I have heard back from technical support and been told that the engineers have found an additional three customers who are having the same problem; the engineers are inclined to think it may be a software problem at this point. Technical support is moving my file to a \"Pending\" category I'm being told which means they are not closing it but doing more research on it before they get back to me.I've noticed some of the other reviewers have mentioned problems with Logitech technical support; I can in all honesty say that technical support has made first class efforts to resolve my problem even thought there has been no success in finding the solution yet. My hats off to their efforts on this!Update November 7, 2010I have installed the new bridge but Alert Commander still can't detect the cameras. The router has found them and assigned an IP address but neither the computer nor the internet can detect the cameras. Technical support is going back to the engineers to see if they have any additional ideas and I'm waiting for a response.Update October 30, 2010Technical support and I spent a lot of time on the phone and exchanging emails today. The results of all of this seems to be a suspected faulty bridge. A new one is being sent to me and all concerned hope this will solve the problem. After it is installed I'll update this review; after so many hours of frustration it seems almost too much to hope for.Update October 17, 2010The mystery remains unsolved as of this date; the Logitech level 2 technical support representative has now referred it to their engineering department, it is simply not behaving in a predictable way. I have had contact with the representative even today, Sunday, and we tried yet a few more diagnostic proceedures with no success. The tech said he would have to talk with an engineer again and would get back with me Tuesday. I'll update this review in the future as things develop; needless to say this has made me very curious as to the nature of the problem.Update October 8, 2010I've been in contact with Logitech technical support many times by email and phone and so far no solution has been found to the undetected cameras. I've tried everything I can think of and everything Logitech has been able to suggest so far with no success.I'm working now with a level 2 technician who told me they wanted to start handling this by telephone but that conversation has not taken place yet. As things progress I'll keep this review updated so you will have the benefit of my experience. I have been appreciative of Logitech's help in resolving this challenge; they seem to be hanging in there with me to find out why Alert Commander isn't detecting the cameras.There is more detailed information available in the \"Comments\" section.Original reviewThe cameras and associated hardware and software came in and I was excited about getting it into operation. Unlike the other reviews I've read to date, I have had a major problem getting the software to detect the cameras. Nothing I did helped so I've contacted Logitech technical support by phone and email and to date even they have not been able to solve the problem.In a recent email they asked me to send them a diagnostic report on the installation; at first I didn't know what they were talking about but after some investigation into the settings menu I found the diagnostic option and ran the program and emailed them the diagnostic report. I did that at the end of last week and when I called Friday I was told the level 2 technician had not had time to review the report and should have some information for me around the first of the following week.The cameras and associated hardware and software all seem of very fine quality they just aren't playing well together yet. To this point the level 1 tech has asked me to make sure the power supplies were plugged in directly to the wall, which they are, and to connect the bridge directly to the router rather than to a switch which was the way I had initially attached it. Even with those alterations the software is not detecting the cameras.I'm personally very intrigued as to why the cameras are not being detected and look forward to getting an opinion from a level 2 tech. As things progress, I'll update this review so if you have a similar problem you'll have the benefit of my experience.", "Date": "October 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "it only records motion", "Author": "davep6", "ReviewID": "RFZVI4LUCZ8Z8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With increasing suspicious solicitors in my neighborhood I've been wanting a front entry camera.  I spent a lot of time doing research and almost purchased a zmodo DVR type system, or a drop cam.  I went with the logitech after seeing it in action because it seemed easier to set up than a traditional cctv dvr system, with with a brand name like logitech I knew I was going to get a product with directions in broken English.I purchased an indoor master system even though I planned to mount it outside on my porch.  It's under a covered patio and we never have any extreme weather conditions. When the product arrived, it appeared to be factory sealed only the setup DVD and instructions were missing.  I downloaded the software from the logitech website, so that wasn't an issue.  On the first few go-arounds the camera was not recognized.  I thought this may be an issue because although my home isn't that big (approx 1500-1600 sq ft) the plugs I was using were on different circuit breaker panels.  I tried over and over and even plugged the camera and the receiver unit into the same outlet and it still wouldn't work.  It wasn't until I used a paperclip to reset the camera that the software recognized the camera.  I then plugged it into the outlets I originally intended to and it worked just fine.  This sort of led me to believe that the product I purchased could have been refurbished, but maybe I'm wrong.I'm pretty happy with the camera overall.  It covers a good size area and I like that you can configure the software to send you text messages or emails during specific hours of your choosing.  One thing I didn't realize(which i should have) when I purchased this camera was that the recording is based on motion only.  You can always view live video(which was very easy to set up on my Iphone 4s), but actual recording is not continuous. It will record for about 5 seconds every time the camera detects motion.  You can also select the areas you want to monitor for motion so that passing vehicles, etc will not trigger a recording.I still think this is a good option for home surveillance but just remember to reset the camera if the software won't recognize it, and that it will not continuously record until it detects motion.", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Capable and straightforward", "Author": "Busy Executive", "ReviewID": "RE7BT3JH9CV5L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a vacation home that's vacant a lot, and I've been searching for a video monitoring solution that can keep an eye on it when I'm not there. After trying a few brands, the Logitech seems about the best option short of spending a few thousand dollars on a professional system. To be clear, there are definite limitations, but to me, the results have been worthwhile, especially considering the price.You need a PC (or Mac...there's a recent download on the Logitech site that offers full functionality for Mac OS X) of some sort to act as DVR and central hub for collecting and recording video. This might be a disadvantage if you have no other reason to have a PC, but for me, since I have a PC (actually, a Mac Mini) for a variety of other home automation apps, it's no big deal. I also prefer this approach to cloud-based solutions that require lots of bandwidth to record video to the cloud.The Logitech Alert Commander software installs easily and is generally unobtrusive. As a backup measure, the cameras have 2G of local storage (that you can upgrade to 32G if you like...32G should hold at least a month of data!), so even if there's a problem with the PC connection, the cameras record to their local storage until the PC comes back online. You can also feed live video to Logitech's mobile app or web site, so you're pretty much covered no matter where you want to review video.The camera itself reminds me quite a bit of HAL from the sci-fi classic 2001: A Space Odyssey. About the size of a mobile phone, they are fairly unobtrusive, and Logitech gives you a variety of ways to mount them, from a free-standing dock to suction cups and ball-and-socket brackets.The only connection to the camera is a 48V PoE Ethernet cable, and to me, this is one of the best features of the product. There are many ways to get this type of signal to the camera, so you have lots of flexibility. Certainly, the simplest and most common approach is to use  the Logitech-supplied HomePlug to run Ethernet over your home's electrical wiring. Plugged into outlets near your computer and near your camera, you create an instant network without running cables anywhere.Of course, if you have existing Ethernet, you can use that too - though you'll probably want a PoE injector or a PoE switch since PoE is generally uncommon in the home. There are two advantages of using conventional Ethernet instead of the HomePlug: greater bandwidth (important if you have multiple cameras), and you can make Ethernet fault-tolerant in case of a blackout by connecting your power injector (or switch) to a small UPS...the camera will keep on recording to its internal memory until the power is restored.Some other reviews seem confused about the HomePlug unit and things like extension cords. The problem with home wiring networks is that certain accessories (UPS devices and many surge suppressors) consider the data flowing over your electrical wires to be \"noise\", and so they filter it out. This might give you purer power, but it also reduces or eliminates the ability for the HomePlug devices to communicate. But, the average simple extension cord has no such filtering capabilities, so it's perfectly fine to connect your HomePlug to a standard extension cord, or to something like a power strip, so long as it does no line filtering.You can also mix-and-match connection options if you want. For instance, if you have several cameras that you want to install near one another, you might use the HomePlug connected to a PoE switch, and then run standard Ethernet to, say, four cameras.To give you an idea, I wanted to put a camera on my outdoor shed to monitor traffic in my driveway. The shed isn't wired into my home's electrical system, so there's no way to use the HomePlug thing. But, I do have a small solar panel on the shed roof, connected to a marine battery and inverter. I was able to use a wireless Ethernet bridge (Netgear) and a power injector to connect an outdoor Logitech 700e camera to my home network, and it works quite well.The other advantage to the Logitech approach is that you're not really locked in to their software. Most security DVR apps (including free, open-source utilities like iSpy) know how to discover and manage PoE cameras like the Alert 7xx series, so if you don't like how Logitech does something, at least you have other options.To me, image quality is very good in bright light, good in dim light and fair in night vision mode. Motion is generally smooth, and there are relatively few effects from excessive image compression. The camera also has a very wide angle view (130 degree - that's like a 12mm ultra-wide angle lens on a 35mm camera) that helps cover large areas with fewer cameras. The night vision mode is effective, and the motion sensing software works well, sending email alerts with an image showing what caused the alert to be triggered. Logitech's mobile app is likewise simple to use and gives you immediate live view access to your camera(s) from anywhere in the world - even if the best you can find is a 3G cellular network connection.One negative was that the camera I bought from Amazon was defective, and it did take a frustrating week of going back and forth with Logitech support before it was replaced. Still, after running some diagnostics to confirm that the camera was indeed defective, they were quick to send me a prepaid UPS shipping label, and I had a replacement in a few days. The replacement has performed perfectly so far.Overall, the Logitech Alert series are flexible, capable cameras that give you lots of options to create a sophisticated monitoring solution for nearly any use.

Initially I bought from Costco a set of Uniden cameras but immediately realized that its software was mulfunctioning and resolutoin was too poor to be of any real use, therefore returned them. After consulted with friends, I bought a set of Logitech cameras - one 750e outdoor master, one 750n outdoor add-on, and 2 indoor 700n add-ons. Despite the 2x price tag, I was happy with my choice because of its outstanding designed-in features:a) Its unique architecture to use the same electrical power cord to transmit video signals, and display/store the video clips on a regular PC, as long as it connects to the Internet. This eliminates a seperate box that requires massive cables wired to each camera around the house, making wiring and installation so easy.b) Its crystal clear and color-rish video quality and commendable night vision feature.c) Each camera contains a standard microSD card that stores recorded video before transmits it to the PC. This allows user to expand the local storage as memory cards get cheaper and not to worry about Internet being down.d) Miniature size with a good looking design.e) Cloud based monitoring service provided by Logitech (about $70/year extra) to access video clips from anywhere around the world through Internet, right from an iPhone or Android smartphone. (Although in my view the speed to load videos are a bit slow.)Despite of these great features, I only give it a 3 star because I am disappointed by its poor reliability, even just comparing it to a mediocre electronic device. Here is what happened:A few weeks after initial installation, my outdoor 750e camera started to switch itself to night vision mode randomly during day time. I called customer service, who instructed me to do all sort of things to help them diagnose what was the problem. Remember an outdoor camera is to be installed at a place out of reach from ground. I had to schedule time with their technician, then climbed to the top of my roof multple times to push reset button, unplug memory card, reconnect cable, once at a time, in order to exhust all possibilities to prove that the unit is indeed mulfunctioning beyond repair, before a permision for a replacement unit.Not long after, one of the indoor units simply stopped recording videos. Again I had to go through the same routine to help diagnose the problems before Logitech could issue a replacement.I have now re-installed both failed units with Logitech replacements and pray I won't see more failures anytime soon, but I have a feeling I would.I am an engineer by training working in high tech industry and I understand an on-site fix is much more economical than a replacement. Also I admit that Logitech tech support people are professional and trying their best to help. However a failure rate of 50% within first month only indicates either a poor quality-by-design or poor production quality, not to mention the wasted hours of a consumer who paid premium price only to provide free serve to Logitech for their product problems.", "Date": "March 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really Nice", "Author": "dogperson", "ReviewID": "RPWRNVNZ925SU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like this system.

You can connect up to six cameras to the system and record the video to your computer hard drive for storage. The cameras themselves use micro-SD cards for offline storage as well, so you have options. You can view the live video from the cameras on your local computer with the Logitech Alert Commander software, via the internet on their website, or via the mobile client on your Android, Blackberry, or iPhone.The base system comes with one camera, power supply, network adapter, and Logitech Alert Commander software. The review system came with an additional indoor camera (700i) in order to allow reviewers to set up a system with multiple input points.INSTALLATION:The installation is basically a no-brainer and the system didn't take any time to set up. The cameras communicate via powerline ethernet which runs the data through your existing electrical outlets to your router. This setup allows you to install the cameras anywhere there is an electrical outlet without worrying about running cables through your house. The master system comes with the powerline-to-ethernet connector that you connect to your router, any additional cameras come with powerline adapters that communicate with the master.NOTE: YOU MUST CONNECT THE ADAPTERS DIRECTLY TO A WALL OUTLET. THE ADAPTERS WILL NOT WORK IF PLUGGED INTO A SURGE SUPPRESSOR. The instructions tell you this, but I decided to test it and they were not kidding; it does not work.  These cameras work with POE switches, so you do not need to use the powerline adapters that come with them. I have the cameras connected to a TRENDnet 8-Port 10/100Mbps PoE Switch (4x 10/100, 4x 10/100 PoE) and it works great. I would highly recommend a PoE switch for installation.The Powerline adapters are NOT plenum rated, so Logitech does NOT support installation of the adapters in the attic.SETUP:The setup is pretty straight forward. You connect the cameras to the powerline adapters or a PoE switch and connect to your router. The Logitech Alert Commander software will find the cameras that you connect and you can then name them and they are ready to view.Adding cameras is as simple as plugging the camera cable into the powerline adapter or PoE switch and then using the software to discover the new camera. It is dead simple.CAMERA FIRMWARE:The camera firmware was out of date on the cameras I was sent. Luckily, it is extremely easy to update the firmware. Simply open the Logitech Alert Commander software, select \"Settings,\" select \"General,\" select \"Updates,\" and then click \"Update Cameras.\" You can also update your software from the same location.SOFTWARE:The Logitech Alert Commander software is fairly intuitive, but setting up recording to your computer is not automatic. You must define a path for the audio/video stream or it will not record at all. The path can be set by going to \"Settings,\" selecting \"Storage,\" then \"Computer.\" The \"Video location\" box will have information entered into it, but it will not work. You MUST define a path for the video by selecting \"Browse\" and setting up a file path.NIGHT VISION:The night vision seems to work very well. I tested the 750e and 750i in the dark and it was able to pick up pretty good detail. The image is not the best in the world, but it is a lot better than expected and the range is pretty good.VIEWING VIA PHONE OR WEB:This is a great feature and one that I will use often. You simply set up an account when you install the Logitech Alert Commander software on your computer and then use that login information on the phone or the web to view live video from the cameras. This works surprisingly well and I am quite impressed with it. There is also a premium version where you can use Web and Mobile Commander to view recorded video and control your system remotely. I have not looked into the cost of this, but it is a very good feature if you want to have complete remote control of the system.BOTTOM LINE:This is an excellent security system and it will work very well for pretty much anyone. The price is a bit higher than many other systems if you want to install multiple cameras, but it is certainly very high quality.OVERALL RATING: 4.5/5 (reduced 1/2 star for price)HIGHLY RECOMMENDED", "Date": "May 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beware as this camera system is unreliable-50% fail rate for me.", "Author": "J.

Hodge \"Mark\"", "ReviewID": "R2131UJLF2I72F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As a preliminary matter, it should be understood that I had a complicated situation, in which the location where the camera had to be installed was pretty far away from any of *my* electrical sources.  Remember, this is not really a wireless system.  It sends signals through your electrical outlet from the camera to a receiver that you attach to your router, which then can connect wirelessly to your computer that runs the relevant software.  So, if (as in my case) the camera has to be installed in a place in which the closest electrical sources are not on your personal grid (ie. not on my apartment's/condo's electrical bill but rather on that of the management/homeowners association/a neighbor) your computer will, of course, not find the camera.That being said, Logitech's website sells longer ethernet lines for the camera to the small box that broadcasts over the electrical grid.  The 100' one wasn't available and it wouldn't sell me the 40' one at my address (and I couldn't find either on any other website).  So we attempted to run our own ethernet (CAT5e) from the camera to the small box that broadcasts over the electrical grid, which I plugged in right next to the outlet where I plugged the receiver in.  It didn't work.  Moreover, putting a normal ethernet cord into the camera requires you to squeeze it in there and is a nightmare pulling it out because the ethernet cord that comes with the system has a non-standard narrow connector and wire (apparently designed to maintain a degree of weatherproofing via a tight seal with the camera).  In any event, as I said, it simply didn't work.  The computer couldn't see the camera.As an experiment, I bought five 25' industrial extension cords and ran them from the socket in my apartment out the door and all the way to the location where the camera needed to be so that the camera was connected to the broadcaster with the manufacturer's ethernet cord and the broadcaster was connected to my electrical grid via 100' of extension cord.  It worked like a charm.  So we ran an electrical line through the walls to the closest point at which my electrical grid could be found.  So the lesson: (assuming you can't get and test the 40' or 100' non-standard ethernet cord sold by Logitech) you can apparently extend the power line from your electrical grid to the broadcaster, but you can't extend the ethernet line from camera to broadcaster.My original review on performance:  Moving on to performance... I was very excited by the prospect of having the camera notify me via e-mail when the motion detector went off and then having the ability to check what the camera was seeing via the iPhone app.  This is all important because this is not merely a preventative measure but is in response to several instances of someone breaking into cars in my parking lot over the course of the last few weeks.  So, the hope was that the camera would catch him/her in the act, notify me so that I could check the camera via my iPhone from any location, and enable me to call the cops while it was still going on.  However, the motion detection is inconsistent.  Moreover, (and this might be because the camera had to be installed about twenty five-thirty feet from the parking lot, which is itelf probably 80-100' wide) even when someone is at the closest point in the parking lot, I could not make out a face even with the image zoomed in 100%.  In addition, regardless of the quality of my internet access/bandwidth (ie. hardwired broadband at home and 5 bar 3G and 5 bar Wifi), I can only see images via the iPhone app periodically, such that starting and stopping the app five times in a row *might* connect once.  This was the case even when I was testing the camera with no extension cords, plugged into the wall socket right next to the receiver (again hardwired broadband and 5 bar Wifi/5 bar 3G to my iPhone).UPDATE:Ultimately, I realized that the main reason that my iPhone app could only periodically see my cameras was because the Alert website itself could only periodically see my cameras.  The iPhone app simply connects to Logitech's Alert website, so if the website doesn't have it, the iPhone app won't have it.  Logitech support had me test my internet connection, which was strong (5 Mbps Download / 1 Mbps Upload).  After fiddling with the camera, the receiver, the plugs, the program, the website, and plenty of time on the phone with Logitech support trying to figure out why their website could only periodically get a signal from my computer, I finally gave up on using their Alert website and their iPhone app in favor of LogMeIn (a free remote-access program/service).  I already had a LogMeIn account to connect to my office computer from home and away.  It turns out there is an iPhone app for LogMeIn as well (free).  I downloaded and installed LogMeIn on the computer that hosts my security cameras, connecting to the website to add it as a computer along with my office computer, installed the LogMeIn iPhone app, logged into LogMeIn, selected the computer that hosts my security cameras and there was my (home) computer screen on my iPhone, complete with the security camera images in real time.  Even better, I could adjust everything from my iPhone, including turning the motion detection alerts off and on, etc.  All that being said, it looks like Alert is getting ready to replace their existing cell phone apps in the immediate future with new programs (rather than updates).  I don't know if that will be any better, but I suspect that if the website cannot consistently see your security camera image, no iphone app reliant upon that website will do so either.I purchased a Logitech Add On Camera to cover the other side of the parking lot and installation was a snap.  Plugged the Logitech ethernet cord in the power adapter on one side and into the camera itself on the other, plugged the power adapter into the wall, and told the computer running the Alert system to search for a second camera... and there it was.I'm still reliant on the Alert program on my home computer to deal with e-mail/text message alerts when the motion detector goes off, and the option to send a \"snap shot\" to my cell phone doesn't actually send an image, just a text message that tells you to look at the attached image (which isn't there).At this point, with the exception of getting an answer to the \"snap shot\" issue, I feel that I just need to tweak the sensitivity on my motion detection (which is controlled in the program very easily) to have things just as I imagined they would be.  Ultimately, with the substitution of LogMeIn, this system works wonderfully.  In as much as there appears to be a free version of LogMeIn that provides these functions (including cell phone access), this is certainly no big burden and a very easy fix.  With that in mind, I am increasing my rating to four stars.  If it wasn't necessary to use free outside software to get all the remote access functions to work properly on my system, I would give it five stars.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice quality video and pictures.

Video quality is excellent. It is easy to setup where to store your videos and how aggressive you want to record the areas being monitored. You can also adjust the field-of-view of each camera to avoid having to manually move the camera.The downsides to the system is Logitech's $80/year fee if you want to use their web-based system to view recorded videos or to adjust the camera settings. You are supposed to install the desktop software only to one computer. The free version of the web-based software lets you view live feeds of all your cameras. That's it. Price seems steep to me considering the price premium of these cameras compared to competitors.Still the ease of setup and quality of the video counts for alot.If your interested in buying the cameras I would check Logitech's website as they have changing promo offers. I was able to pick up an outdoor master camera and 3 add-ons for $760. I ended up returning the cameras I bought from Amazon after I was declined a price match.Edit: one major problem is that if there is a temporary power loss (i.e. the lights turn on/off for less than 5 seconds) the cameras will lose contact with your computer. The only solution I have found is to reset the cameras by unplugging them from the wall for a minute, then replugging them back in.

The camera is very sturdy.  The mount is not as well built as the camera.  I tested the camera indoors prior to mounting and found that it got quite warm.  I am not sure if it actually has a heating element in it or not.  The indoor camera did not get hot.I initially could not connect with any camera.  I looked through the online documentation which was useless.  I eventually found that my router (D-link DIR 655) had a setting for multimedia data which was turned off.  After changing that I had no problems finding the cameras during testing.  I would have thought the documentation for the camera would have something about checking router settings as D-Link is a pretty common router brand.The major frustration I had was with the home plug data transfer.  I plugged the camera in the outlet I was using for it's final installation.  I was able to get the camera to connect.  However after I went and mounted everything permanently the system would only connect sporadically.  It turns out the outlet I used was at the end to the circuit and the connection was very weak when it did connect.  You can check the signal strength which I did not do prior to permanent mounting.  I eventually did find another outlet that gave a better signal but I had to add a 25 ft ethernet cable to get to it.  Since then the system works very reliably.  I have an indoor and outdoor camera and plan to add another outdoor camera soon.The motion detection works well.  The clarity of the image is not bad but you can't recognize faces at 50ft from the camera.  The night vision works well but I wish the emitters were not visibly red.  It's very obvious.  I have seen other emitters that are not visible at night so I know it can be done.  The LED signal indicators can be turned off through the software.I really like the software but it has quirks too.  You can't maximize the program window and see all camera views together.  You only get a large image of one camera not the collage of all cameras you see in the smaller window.  Also you can't see any live images when remote connecting to the computer.  You can't see recorded video either unless you pull up the video files directly.  The web connect works well for live images but you can't get recorded video unless you pay the annual fee.Overall I would buy again but you better be prepared for some effort to get it all started.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good plug 'n play security camera system", "Author": "Scott \"IT Pro & Hardware Guru\"", "ReviewID": "RY2Y1GIVFJF31", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a good consumer grade security camera system that anybody can install and get above average video/images with great iphone/ipad and software integration.The video quality isn't quite real HD, and you don't have a real optical zoom to help make out any details. However it is a much higher resolution that competing cameras in this price range and not having any moving parts or motors means one less thing to break over time, especially in bad weather.The only major complaint I have with these units is the poor motion detection, and that the video quality still needs to higher to better make out individuals at a distance.Also while you can pay ($80/yr) for the online \"Alert\" internet service, your cameras do NOT automatically upload to the internet, when you check videos, only then does your camera or remote PC and web browser request the video which is then loaded from your cameras memory card and transmitted to your device.Still, unless something better comes along or you're lucky enough to have several thousand dollars to spend on commercial grade HD security cameras this is likely your best bet today.Update: I've had the 700e operating outdoors in heavy snow and rain last winter and it has run perfect without any issues common to outdoor security cameras such as condensation/fogging.

The camera does an okay job of confining its recording to only movement within the zones, but tends to err on the side of recording versus not recording, which is probably a good thing.I love being able to monitor the cameras over the Internet.

The set up was not as easy as some reviews make it seem. I am not a tech person, but I'm also not an idiot. I downloaded the software carefully following the instruction guide, located dedicated outlets, properly positioned the network adapter and power supply, and went through the business of installing the wall mount on my front porch. After all that, the software couldn't \"locate\" the camera despite numerous attempts. I fiddled with the router and worked backwards through the instructions to troubleshoot the disconnect only to have to call customer support. After walking me in and out of my front door between the camera and my office desktop, the rep finally suggested that I reset the camera with a paper clip. Fine. The camera and software were communicating at last. I just wish he had suggested that in the first place. That only took about two hours; not quite how I would describe \"easy set-up.\" I also would have appreciated it if Logitech were a bit more specific about necessary tools for installation, i.e. what size drill bit to use would have been helpful instead of trial and error. In addition, an extra pair of hands would've been clutch when I was trying to mount the camera on the wall.Aside from the less-than-stellar set-up experience, I am none too thrilled that the power supply is connected to an outdoor outlet which also happens to be a GFI outlet. This did not present any problems in the first month, but when I recently attempted to run Alert Commander on my computer to view the previous night's recordings, it shut the camera down. When I called customer support, I was told the system doesn't like GFI outlets. I can't say that I know of anyone who doesn't have outdoor GFI outlets for code/safety reasons. It was recommended that I try an extension cord to see if that will rectify the problem. I don't have an extension cord in the house that isn't already in use and the thought of running a cord through a front window or door to another outlet is just not an acceptable solution especially given what I paid for the system. It looks like my only option will be to drill a hole through the exterior wall to run the cable from the porch into a living room outlet which I'm sure is easier said than done. As it stands now, the camera is running without benefit of the software, text alerts, or much else to recommend it. And I am praying that it is actually recording to the SD card otherwise the thing is all but useless to me until I can find a more agreeable resolution to the problem. I'm also not thrilled about the business of climbing up on a ladder to retrieve the SD card which essentially announces to the neighbors and everyone else, \"Here's the camera. Come help yourself to it and the memory card! Just make sure you unplug it first.\"On one last note, the night vision proved to be pretty poor, and in some instances, completely failed to detect and record any activity come nightfall which, of course, is when most of the shenanigans occur in my neighborhood.All in all, it seems ridiculous that Logitech would make a GFI-incompatible outdoor camera which they recommend plugging into an outdoor outlet (as pictured in the instructions) many of which are GFI as required by electrical code. Logitech Alert 750e Outdoor Master System has brought me little to no peace of mind since installing it. I would recommend that anyone considering the system take a long, hard look at the product and its system requirements (dedicated, non-GFI outlets) to determine if it will in fact address their own home security needs or be more of a headache than its actually worth.", "Date": "May 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works well for me, would like Mac version", "Author": "Robert C.

There were two goals: observe my dog while I was at work & monitor my front porch, as I had been experiencing package thefts. I researched systems and was torn between this one and Dropcam. This system was much more expensive, but offered more options in terms of saving video, as well as better picture quality, so I made the leap. After going through two systems, I returned the last one for a full refund.The biggest problem was spotty connectivity. I never did figure out the cause of this. I had a brand new wireless router, high-speed broadband internet, and yet, even when the camera and adapters were in the same room, I could not get them to connect consistently. When I did get the system running, I was scared to unplug the camera to change its location because I was afraid it would not connect again.The second problem, and the *likely* cause of the connectivity issues, was with the adapters. The system comes with two huge network adapters that communicate with each other and connect your camera to the internet and to your local computer. I went through two of these. One overheated and stopped working after less than two days of use. The other did not work right out of the box. On my third attempt, the adapters functioned, but the above-noted connectivity issues arose again, which led to my decision to withdraw the $300 investment and return the entire system.Other issues: Logitech charges for cloud/online access/live streaming of the video through smart devices or remote locations. However, it is free to have the video live stream to your local PC. To overcome this issue, I installed a desktop access software called Teamviewer. It worked great, as Teamviewer even has an iPhone app that allowed me to watch my dog anytime, from anywhere. I installed the program on my home computer, my work computer, and my iPhone and I was able to monitor the dogs from anywhere. Logitech's app was not reliable and gave only blurry images. However, as well as this all worked, it was a lot of effort and very time-consuming to get it all set up. I am pretty tech-savvy, so I was able to get things to work, but I can't imagine the outcome if my mother had been the one trying to set this all up. It never would have happened. The other drawback to this is that my local PC had to be on ALL THE TIME. The impact on my electricity bill was notable, though less than the cost of Logitech's cloud service.

They have been up and running for about a year and a half and going strong!  I truly did not expect the system to be this reliable and this robust. I installed them as a bit of a novelty, but they have now become a real security system.I looked at all sorts of solutions and settled on the Logitech package because of the HD camera resolution, solid night vision, option to record sound, single (Ethernet) output cable, local (camera-mounted) recording storage, and no DVR box.  I wanted the system to make the cameras available on my home network and let my Mac take it from there.It works like a charm.  The Commander software works well and is simple enough to use.  The remote access to the cameras  (via iPad, for example) is extra cool.  You can watch live video from your cameras from anywhere in the world - all you need is an Internet connection.Setup requires some work (assuming you want your cabling to be neat and tucked out of sight) but the documentation is clear and complete.  Assuming you plug the cameras into clean, direct-line electric circuits (no power strips, etc), chances are you will get a decent signal and all will be well.I have been very impressed with the build quality of the cameras.  They are sophisticated little special-purpose computers, and I have been impressed that they have withstood the elements for a year and a half now, running 24/7 with no trouble at all.What the documentation is not clear about - and what I have come to appreciate as the system's best feature - is that these cameras are fully PoE (power over Ethernet) compatible.  What this means is that - should the powerline-based HomePlug connection ever flake out (as mine did recently for reasons unknown), you can connect the cameras directly to your (PoE capable) router!This was not obvious to me during the initial install and I installed all of the cameras using the included HomePlug adapters (which inject the cameras' signals onto the powerline network of the house) and the included adapter which plucks the video signals from the powerline and feeds them to your router.  This seemed to work OK for several months (with some occasional hiccups), but I noticed that the diagnostics suggested the signal strength for some of the cameras was weak.  When two of the cameras suddenly went dark on me recently, I looked into this again and found that there was another (better) way to connect the cameras.What you will need is either a PoE capable Ethernet switch or router (most basic switches/routers are not) or an inexpensive mid span PoE injector for each camera.  This will provide power to the camera and allow you to connect the Ethernet connection coming from the camera directly into a standard router/switch.  Voila!  The beauty of this setup is that your connection bandwidth will be rock solid.  No more dropouts if the electrical circuit gets overloaded.In short, I could not be happier with this system.  The cameras are exceptionally well built and offer multiple connectivity options.  My only suggestion to Logitech would be to make the versatility of the connectivity options more obvious to the consumers.

Before I found the Logitech system I tried a pair of foscam cameras. Never again! I'm not an IT professional but I know how to get around my network. I spent countless hours trying to get those cameras to work remotely with no success. I have no idea how that could be the #1 rated camera on Amazon other than the pile of bogus reviews upping their rating.That's when I began to look for an easier to set up option. The Logitech Alert system is just that. Within minutes I had the camera up and running. I can't imagine how it could be any easier. I'm so impressed I'm ordering two more. I went with indoor cameras to watch the front and back of my home. I did that partly for simplicity and the fact that I didn't want someone to show up with a ladder and help themselves to my camera. As others have mention the night vision is useless if you have the camera looking through glass as the IR lights reflect back at the lens and wash the picture out.The camera has a fixed lense so you can't pan, tilt or zoom. The good news is the fixed lense is quite good. With the Web Commander ($80/yr), or from the computer you set the camera(s) up on, you can use the zoom button to focus in on one area which brings the image closer but I wouldn't call it a true zoom.I use the mobile apps for my ipad and iphone. They have worked perfectly with no problems. I find the mobile apps more user friendly than the Web Commander for reviewing past recorded clips and a snapshot of the image is shown.To date the camera has been working flawlessly for a month. I opted for the $80/year subscription so I could remotely view the video. You can view the camera for free but you have no control remotely if you wanted to view the recorded video or change the settings. I was concerned that having the camera send video back to the Logitech server for storage would adversely impact my internet usage at the vacation home. Surprisingly the amount of data has been negligible. I'm allotted 100 GB per month and in the last month I have used less than .5 GB.Coming from my frustrating foscam experience I could only go up and the Logitech Alert system did not disappoint me.

The camera itself is very high quality. I have had it outdoors for almost two years now, and it has taken the weather like a champ. It has never failed me. That said, I have mixed emotions about this product. My main complaints are regarding Logitech's software and service. Several of its remote features require an $80/year \"premium\" service fee, which I think is ridiculous. They should be standard. They charge because they proxy all viewing traffic through their servers. This makes the camera extremely easy to set up, but it also constantly causes delays when viewing due to server/bandwidth congestion. When viewing from a mobile device, you will be staring at a \"loading video\" message more often than actually viewing the camera footage. All of this is fixed by dropping Logitech's software and using Blue Iris instead. I recently switched, and I am very pleased.What I like:* Small body attracts little attention. People have rarely even noticed that it existed.* Weather proof body* Image is bright and clear, but not \"HD.\" It is difficult to read a license plate on a parked car. It is not possible at all if the car is moving.* Very easy to set up due to power line communication provided by the Master System* Logitech's servers facilitate locating and connecting to the cameras from mobile devices. This is much more user friendly than having to identify your external IP address and open proper firewall ports.* Night vision works well.What I don't like:* Lack of physical Pan/Tilt/Zoom. The digital PTZ degrades the image quality.* When viewing your camera remotely, Logitech restricts you to 3 minutes (10 minutes if you pay for \"premium\") at a time before it disconnects you.* Logitech's servers and/or bandwidth seem to be overly burdened. It takes a long time to connect to the feed and then is has to keep \"loading video\" over and over.* While the lens is wide screen, the video resolution is not. So it creates some distortion of the image.* It only produces 15 fps max.* Last January, Logitech announced they will be selling their digital video security divisions (http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/23/logitech-q3-earnings-selling-harmony-remotes/), so I'm not sure what that means for the product's future.If you have a PoE (power over ethernet) switch, or PoE injector, within range of the 50ft cable that comes with the camera, you can save yourself some money and buy the camera by itself without the Master System.Like I said before, almost all of the issues that I have with this camera are resolved with the Blue Iris software Foscam Blue Iris Professional - Supports Many IP Camera Brands Including Foscam and Agasio, Zone Motion Detection, H.264 Compression Recording, E-mail And SMS Text Messaging Alerts! for a one time cost.

If you're looking to buy a security camera and don't want to read those super long (but very helpful) reviews, here are a couple selling points for this camera:1. Easy installation: since it only require one power outlet on the camera side, there is only ONE cat5 cable going from the camera to its adapter and then ONE power cable from the adapter to the outlet. On the router side, there is only ONE cat5 cable going from the adapter to the router and the adapter plugs directly to the wall outlet.2. Easy setup: since it is NOT an IP camera and it does NOT use any of your network IP, thus ZERO networking setup is needed. All you need to do is insert the micro sd card (it's pre-inserted, but if you want a bigger card, just swap it out with the 2GB one), mount the camera, pop in the setup CD and follow the onscreen instruction, plug it into a wall outlet, plug in the other adapter and connect to the router and TA-DA! You can start playing with your camera!3. Very good picture quality: pictures are very clear in day time AND at night. The night time quality is basically the grayscale version of the day time picture. I've done some research on many security cameras and this one definitely have the best night vision quality.4.

Bummer.ORIGINAL rating and Update #1:I'm trying to add only new info here; these are great cameras, sensitivity is excellent, software is generally good and the quality level is high. I'm pretty happy.Why 4 stars?  The wall wart is huge (2\"+ from wall) and ugly.  Good luck getting your wife to allow this thing except behind furniture.  The outside set-up is even uglier as there's a cord from the wall wart to the 110v plug... it's clumsy, big and highly visible.  As others have noted, the micro-sd card is hard to access, but I'm not certain why you'd want to access it regularly (see below).  And it's much easier to access on the indoor versions than it is on this one.There are trade-offs designing a security camera and Logitech has chosen to use the Powerline standard.... this is a good decision as it avoids a lot of cable stringing, but it's not perfect.  You need to understand the downsides.  First, Powerline may not communicate reliably (see below for fuller discussion of why and what you can do about it).  Secondly - as to the outdoor camera - this thing works great.  BUT you need an outlet within about 15 feet and if you don't have one you're going to need to run an extension cord (ugh) or some special flat ethernet line (the weatherproofing of the camera requires this kind of cable).  IF you do all this, are you then going to have an outdoor security camera plugged into an outdoor outlet?  If so, what keeps someone from walking off with the whole thing?  Of course if you run the line in to an indoor outlet, all well and good, but then the convenience of plug-and-play is defeated.Also, the night vision version of the indoor camera (700n) and this outdoor camera don't work well when set up inside to \"look out a window\".... the infra red is totally defeated by the window glass.  They work fine \"looking through the window\" for daylight or lighted areas, but not in the dark.MAC USERS:  Everything you read will tell you that this system requires a PC for initial set-up.  This is no longer true:  as of November, 2012 Logitech has the Alert Commander software for OSX (10.6 or higher) available for download.  Installation was very simple and the two cameras were recognized immediately.  There is a very cool feature which allows you to customize the sensitivity areas of each camera, using up to 16 adjustable rectangles to define which motion will trigger the camera and which motion will be ignored.  Very helpful for avoiding triggering by a bush that is in the corner and gets blown around. I'm still learning all the ins and outs but I'm very happy with the picture quality.There are also free apps for the iPad and the iPhone, for live streaming.  Apparently you have to buy the extra cost subscription if you want to download the recordings to your iDevice.  The software has a couple of bugs but they are minor (I have been unable to turn the  camera LEDs off or the camera audio on).And yes, my system is all Apple (Airport eExtreme, etc) and of course Safari works fine when you want to use a browser to view your cameras.FOR EVERYONE:  this system is based on the Powerline technology which passes a signal over your home's electrical wiring.  This has many advantages in terms of quick set-up as you don't have to run a lot of wires around.  I have had Powerline installed in my house for several years as part of my security system and as a very reliable way to distribute ethernet throughout the house without stringing cable.  But there is a key limitation to Powerline which may explain some of the lower ratings you see here....  This is the case with all Powerline set-ups.  In some cases they communicate just fine, but in others they don't.Here's why:  most homes have a 2-branch electrical system.... one 220 volt line comes into the house.  The 220 volt input is split into two 110 volt circuits called \"buses\".  Each bus has multiple circuits and circuit breakers.  Powerline system will usually work fine on different circuits as long as they're on the SAME bus.  When the signal has to travel from one bus to the other things get iffy.  The way around this is to install a device in your circuit breaker panel called a signal bridge. This device simply passes the signal from one bus to the other, but it takes up two circuit breaker positions.  INSTALLATION IS NOT FOR AMATEURS.If you  share a panel (in an apartment, for example) this may not be possible.  Note that if you share a panel you potentially share the Powerline signal so think about your security.  Other difficulties may arise if you have electrical sub-panels.  And if your condo building has a 440 volt incoming line.... well, I dunno.You can avoid a bridge by keeping your cameras and the receiver (only one of the latter is needed, for up to 6 cameras) on the same bus.  I've also read that it's desirable to avoid the bus that has your refrigerator on it (or any other appliance with a large motor), as these things can generate signal interference, but I haven't had that issue.And plain extension cords are fine, but AVOID surge suppressors... they block the signal.OTHER THOUGHTS: Be aware that there are two versions of the indoor camera.. the 700i doesn't have night vision, the 700n does.  If you can find the 700i it's cheaper and works as well \"looking out a window\" as the 700n.  Of course if you want to watch inside the house in the dark (baby's room perhaps) you 'll want the 700n.The motion detectors on these things are adjustable for sensitivity and on the highest level they are very sensitive.... think a crow walking around on the grass 50 yards away.The cameras come with a 2GB micro-SD installed... You can replace this with up to a 32 gb card.  How long this is good for is dependent upon how much you record, so the sensitivity setting is important as is the activity level in front of the camera.  [\"Activity level\" includes moving branches, etc.]  Also when you turn on the controlling PC/Mac, the card gets downloaded and the camera writes over it when it's full or downloaded, so you probably won't need to ever change the card if you set it up correctly.There's a user community on the Logitech site and there is discussion of downloading your video to your Dropbox or other cloud storage.  Seems to me that if you  can do that then you can go back in history even if you're accessing it with a browser from a remote computer.... so then why would you need the subscriptions service???  Just asking....I'll post more as I learn more.Update 1:  I have contacted Logitech support about the issues I had using the Mac software to adjust the camera settings.  They were VERY helpful, but the only way we could resolve the issues was to use a PC to adjust the cameras, then migrate the cameras to the Mac network.  The latter happens pretty much automatically once you re-launch the Mac version of Alert Commander.Logitech has escalated the issue and we have exchanged several emails.

The connection seems to always be weak, whether all of my devices are connected or not. Both the homeplug to the router and the camera are on a line which has little to no interference, nor is the electrical line old. The router has many ports open, as well as UPnP enabled, along with a host of other functions.The main problem, again, is that the camera is unable to keep a steady connection to the computer which it is supposed to store recordings on, as well as be monitored from.I've tried multiple things, whether it was moving where it was plugged in, to checking plug polarity to make sure they were correctly wired, to no avail.Another issue with the system is the microSD card in the camera. After only a year (or so) the SD card is showing as failed in the Logitech Software, and formatting it does not help. The camera has been reset, updated, and the card formatted multiple times, to no avail as well. I'd take down the camera and remove the card, but the camera is attached to the wall and requires a lot of work to be taken down.This is apparently a recurring issue on the forums, as many people mention, though if asked, Logitech will apparently send you another SD card.A few other small complaints; the camera occasionally lowers the frame rate to around 12FPS when it senses motion. It's not a defect in my specific camera, as this was mentioned by other users in the forums as well.---Now, for the positives.The recording quality on this camera is very good, surprisingly; the night vision feature which uses infrared lights works exceptionally well. The video is almost HD quality (not quite), and is more then good enough to be used to identify faces if necessary.The Logitech software lets you customize how the recordings take place (you choose the areas which will activate recording). Quick note***: This camera is not a full-time recording device. It only records on motion activity in the zones you specify, along with the sensitivity you specify.You can also change whether the LED on the front lights up, whether to turn on certain functions of the camera (night vision, etc) video settings such as brightness and color, and more. Recording can be stored wherever designated on the computer in which Logitech is installed on, though the recordings do take up quite a bit of space, especially if the camera is set to a high sensitivity or large motion area.Anyway, not to make this review unnecessarily long, but at this point, for the money, I'd suggest another system. Unless your house is brand new (which should eliminate any issues with Powerline connection problems), there are simply too many issues related to dropped video, random drops in FPS, SD card failures, and more, for me to recommend this product.Overall: 5/10", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolutely Excellent Home Security Camera", "Author": "Derry Hresdon", "ReviewID": "RRI2W4LBQOC9D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Logitec Alert 750n after learning that Logitech had added Mac support for their Alert monitoring system. For years I'd been looking for some kind of web based security camera system I could set up myself. I know a lot of home security and alarm companies offer the same kind of service, but I wanted something I could set up myself both for expediency and cost's sake, and the 750n was perfect.Setup was incredibly simple. You plug the camera into wall power, and plug a wall-powered receiver into your router,and the camera communicates with the receiver through the power lines in your house. I didn't realize how simple this was going to be when I ordered it, and I was expecting to either have to run several dozen feet of cable, or to buy a new router to go with this camera. This was absolutely not the case. I unboxed it, and within 10 minutes I was watching the live stream on my laptop.The picture quality is absolutely amazing, both in daylight and night-vision. The camera records when it detects motion, and will send you an alert when it detects a certain amount of motion in a defined area. The camera is also wide angle, with a software crop and zoom, meaning the camera may be recording more than what you seen on your screen.The Alert software is good. I added an Alert 700e outdoor camera to my setup, and I'm able to watch the live feed from both on my computer, phone, and on the web. I paid an extra $79 a year to watch the recorded videos on the web and mobile.This brings me to my first of two small gripes: The cameras store video on a micro-SD card inside the camera. The alert software gives you the option of backing up recorded video to your computer, but the software will only back up if your computer is on your home network. If you were to take your computer to work, or try to back up your videos to a computer not in your house, you'd be unable. This seems like a minor problem, but if your house is broken into or catches fire it's not inconceivable that both the camera and the computer backing up the videos might be lost. When that happens your videos, including the event, are gone. The cameras will let you view your videos on the web or your phone, but they're not stored remotely.My second gripe: I set my camera up looking through a window at my front door. When night vision turns on, the IR illuminator reflects off the window, giving me a great video of the reflected camera and absolutely no view of whats going on outside. If there were a way to turn on night vision, without the IR illuminator, this would be fine, but there is currently no way to do this. This is a bit of an edge case, but it's not unthinkable that the camera would be used like this; it comes with a front suction cup mount for exactly this purpose. The only recourse in this case is to turn off night vision, which renders the camera practically useless for 10 to 12 hours a day.All in all, though, these are minor complaints against an otherwise great camera. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking to build their own home security setup.", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Camera! but.....", "Author": "cruceskeith \"CrucesKeith\"", "ReviewID": "R254Q0C01GQSC1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "4 stars instead of 5 because of the software.This has got to be one of the best cameras made, hands down, regardless of price. I was expecting crisp, clear video, both in day and night vision. It exceeded my expectations! The 130 degree (plus) viewing angle is awesome! I set it up over PoE rather than use their power boxes. Going PoE with a UPS insures uninterrupted video feed in the event of a power outage.However, I do have issues with the software.Yes, it's 720 HD, but in the old 4X3 format. (Old TV format), instead of current 16X9 format. That's minor compared to the fact there are no software options, such as; NO PTZ, NO continuous record mode, NO record on demand. The motion detect mode function either detects everything or nothing, no in between no matter how much you adjust it. The notification of video motion detection will fill up your mail box in no time due to over sensitivity, so it had to be disabled making e-mail notification function worthless.Logitech has hidden the user name & password for camera access, as well as the camera frequency over PoE from it's customers, FORCING you to use their limited, inferior, glitchy proprietary software. I tried both Blue Iris and iSpy security camera software, but was unable to access the camera. The only web browser viewing is through their web access set-up. I have many other complaints about their proprietary software, mainly that it's proprietary and customers are locked out, BUT....Despite the crappy limited software, I ordered a second camera, and will probably order a few more before I'm done. The video feed over PoE is the best I've ever seen! Well worth every penny! Hopefully, Logitech will listen to it's customers and improve the software and, or, make the camera open source.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Review of Logitech Alert Master system", "Author": "Sriram Sundararajan", "ReviewID": "R1YZA4QV5SZ9F7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Setup was a breeze.

I don't leave it on all the time but only when I leave the house. Call me paranoid but I don't like the idea of having a live camera feed from inside my house going out on the internet 24/7 when access is only a password away. But anyway it works as advertised giving me very clear live video and sound on my iphone. I moved into a new neighborhood recently and it gives me peace of mind when I'm away.I didn't bother with the subscription ($80/yr) just to get rewind on my phone. If it alerts me I can easily do my own iphone screen shots if the bad guys are in my house, (press the power and home buttons together). It also emails still shots. Really don't need remote camera control as I use the wide angle setting. There is nothing to control unless you are zoomed in. Needless to say the iphone app works well. Once set up all you do is tap the app to see what your camera sees.It's fast and easy to install. With the included Powerline module you can put the camera anywhere where there is an electrical outlet. Powerline works ok, but for the smoothest video you might want to use PoE, which is an ethernet wire with a power injector ($20) which you can buy elsewhere, straight into your router. There is a lot of data coming from the camera so wired just works better, and in my case the camera is next to my computer anyway. I'm thinking of adding the outdoor version camera in which case I will probably use the Powerline module.I have tried putting the camera in the window using the included suction cup mount. Works great in the daytime. Night time not as well as the infrared LED reflects back off the glass. You can still see out but not nearly as far, unless you have other lights on outside. My pool seems to attract a lot of birds and they kept setting off the email alerts, so now it watches over my living room instead.The night vision is very good. However, the infrared LED it uses is very visible at night and draws attention to the camera, so be aware of that if you want to use the outdoor model on the front of your house or where ever people are walking by.", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Keeps An Eye On What Needs An Eye", "Author": "Carter (1amazonreviewer@gmail . com) \"Carter\"", "ReviewID": "R2YKVCWPKLXQJV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The set up of the Logitech 750e was very easy as long as you follow the basic steps and dont try to skip anything.

The video image is very sharp and responsive.  The Powerline Networking functionality works surprisingly well, and makes it very convenient to locate the camera anywhere there's nearby access to an electrical outlet.My biggest criticism is Logitech's horrible support for Mac OS X.  A Windows PC is REQUIRED for initial setup and configuration.  I did this step on Mac OS X using VMWare Fusion running Windows XP.  I work in IT so this was trivial for me - it may not be an option or worth the extra expense for most buyers.  Once the device is set up,  the web-based Commander can be used to control the camera and view live video or clips stored on the SD card.  I've also tested the iOS app on iPhone 4S and it works very well.  It's pretty neat to be able to view the live camera from anywhere on my phone!There are a few items of feedback I'd like to give Logitech as well as a wish list of features I'd like to see.  Here we go:1) Make a version of the outdoor 700e camera in WHITE instead of black.  When mounted against white soffit trim or light-colored exterior building surfaces, the camera is too conspicuous.  It would be easy for Logitech to offer buyers the choice of white or black.2) Make it easier to change the SD card by redesigning the removable port cover to open to the side rather than to the back.  The current design is such that with the camera mounted near a wall, it will need to be removed from the mount to get at the screws holding the cover on and then open it to get at the tiny SD card slot.  It would be nice to leave the camera on the mount when changing SD card, so that the aimed direction doesn't get disturbed.  Fortunately this should not need to be done very often.  I upgraded the 2GB card to a 32GB card I bought later.3) Make a Mac OS X version of the software - or better yet, don't require any computer-based software at all.  Make it so the camera can be configured from any web browser, including performing firmware updates!4) The Logitech Alert web subcription is $80 a year.  I think that should include the ability to store video clips on the Logitech site so that they're not stuck on the SD card.  Logitech does offer DropBox integration, but it's not direct from the camera.  To use this feature one must be running Windows and the software must be running all the time and video clips must be synced from the camera to the computer.  This is a cobbled-together solution.  The camera should have the option of uploading clips to the Logitech Alert web site where they would be stored in the cloud.Bottom line, this is probably the best device of its type available, in terms of performance + cost + ease of use, but the experience is marred by inferior software and support, especially for Mac.", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best System Ever.

Twice. (Yes - same package).  After reading and article in a newspaper forwarded to me by a friend, I decided to wait to wait for this one.  I didn't like the quality and reliability (or lack thereof) of the wireless systems I'd seen.  And I didn't like all the wires and proximity requirements of the wired ones.  This, I believed, was the best of both worlds and I was not disappointed.  I could not BELIEVE the ease of use, cleanliness of installation, and total quality of video from this camera.  I have this, the 750e, as well as the 700i, and they are nothing short of magical.  In the absence of flying cars, *this* is the future I had otherwise dreamed of.  It's now been a year and half and I've had to reset the card on my outdoor one twice now and my indoor one only once.  That's it. The process is simple and quick.  I'm amazed with Logitech's ability to push software updates to the devices through their \"Powerline\" technology.  I find their forums to full of articulate users and their updates to be well thought out and based on feedback. I am nothing short of impressed.  I even enjoy their monthly news letter.I had the *opportunity* to submit my videos to the local police department when over a year later, another package was stolen.  Although the perp has never been caught it is not because of the awesome surveillance system that I have created with my cameras.  In fact, the police were very impressed with the quality and in recognized the kid two blocks away because of the video.  However, when they came by to have me confirm his identity, I was too slow and the perp had left the bus stop where he had been noticed by police.  I still see the perp walk by from time to time.  It kills me inside to know they haven't caught him, but I know it will happen, and when the day comes, I will press charges.  Besides, it's not like he'd outrun the police (see attached video).  The video above shows the young man leaving our property with a wedding present from my grandparents (I never told them about the previous theft, or that I had gotten a P.O. Box as a result of the theft) as well as our custom wedding \"thank you\" notes.I digress.  I must, however, add one more round of applause.  I love love love being able to see the app from my cameras on my iphone, my husband's iphone, and our ipads.  It makes going out of town much more of a comfort and it's pretty cool to show your friends and family the cat's view while we're away.*Note: I will try to link my i700 review here after I post it as well, as the video contains a much better view of the actual crime.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Security helped by system", "Author": "Prof. Dr. Lorin L Cranford", "ReviewID": "R9Y4T6NE6ARO8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The security cameras are working fine.

In the past 6 months that I've owned the system, I have added a camera and had only minor problems connecting to the cameras from my iPhone.  Logitech has released a real iPad app that even has audio streaming, which is a great benefit.  The image quality of the camera is better than I would have expected at this price point, but not as good as advertised. The software is Windows only (.NET), so forget about running it on your Macs or Linux boxes without firing up VMware or VirtualBox. The external camera has been a real trooper... but...Here is where Logitech really shines though -> Customer Service!I had one of the external power supplies go bad on one of my 700e cameras (which is why I'm writing it on this item) and Logitech is sending me out a new power supply for free. I don't even have to send back the old one! It's a great day for customer service when they just say \"where do we send a new one?\" and take my word for it that mine died (which it did, unfortunately).", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good system, if a little fussy", "Author": "Personne", "ReviewID": "R2AMZ4C26HJ692", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Logitech has put together an interesting system for those who wish to do home security on a budget.  The user can start out with a single camera and grow the system by adding additional cameras as needed.  I've been testing a system with two cameras--one for exterior placement and one for indoors. Logitech's literature claims that the system can be set up in minutes.  While it's true that the software can be easily installed and started, it requires a lot more thought to get the system performing as needed.The key to the system is a chunky wall-wart.  It plugs into the wall with a cable that is connected to your home network.  This wall-wart acts as a  network controller for the cameras (which connect through house wiring) and as a web server.  Each camera has a wall-wart of its own, serving as both power supply and network access point.  Each camera comes with hardware that allows it to be mounted in any of several ways. The cameras provide both video and audio, and contain a memory card to store data.  This card may be replaced with a larger card for longer duration.  The exterior camera also provides infrared illumination, giving it reasonable night vision.The control software then allows you to set up the cameras.  Set-up includes naming the camera and setting motion zones in the camera's field of view.  The camera will only record when it detects motion in one of its zones.  There are several criteria for setting sensitivity, and they can be fussy. Once your cameras are set up, things really get interesting.  You can easily view live images from the cameras.  When the software is running, video is automatically downloaded to your computer from the cameras' video cards. From there it can easily be reviewed (it uses the H.264 encoder, the best combination for quality and storage efficiency).  Logitech has an $80 yearly subscription that will allow you full control of the system from any place in the world with a network connection. But they also provide a less-expensive (free) capability.  Whenever the cameras detect motion, you can have a snapshot emailed to you.  This is done by the system wall-wart and requires no PC intervention.  I must say that I find this pretty nifty.  Even those who choose not to purchase the subscription can still view live video over the web, by logging on to Logitech's website and entering a password.The part of the system that needs work is the software.  For one thing it is Windows-only.  There's really no excuse for that: both Mac and Linux systems need to be supported.  I spent a couple of weeks trying--and failing--to get it to work on my Mac using a Parallels virtual machine.  A real Windows machine is needed (I ended up installing Bootcamp--not for the faint of heart).  In addition, both the control software and web access require Adobe Flash. That works for now, but Flash is an old and unloved technology.  I do hope that Logitech will move to HTML5.  I also found that there are a few points in setup that unplugging, replugging and resetting may be necessary.  It can be fiddly.If the reader has stayed with me up till now, it's worth pointing out some important considerations.  These cameras are always on and are always available on the web.  A strong password and some secrecy are required, or there can be uninvited viewers watching both the exterior and interior of your home.  These views are available to Logitech, so one must put some faith in security measures taken by that company.  A professional thief will know how to disable the system (a baseball bat will destroy both camera and memory card), so unobtrusive placement of cameras is important.Late winter weather forced me to do initial set-up and testing indoors.  That turns out to have been a good thing. A permanent installation can take some time, especially when drilling holes and placing cables. It's nice to know how the system works before taking that step.  All in all this is a nice way to have some peace-of-mind on the cheap.", "Date": "March 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Poor frame rate and blurry video make this a poor choice", "Author": "David Oliver", "ReviewID": "R2M5P4WWGVOJKH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this system to monitor traffic down a private lane.

Overall, I am very impressed and only have a few minor qualms.I will start with the video quality which is REALLY impressive.  My son noted that convenience stores should use this system as the video is far clearer then what you see on television when some thug stages a hold up.  I was not expecting much in night vision mode but even that works very well.Setup is is mostly quick and easy.  A software update was needed but that took place automatically.  The PC side of the software is very intuitive.  As someone else noted, the biggest deficiency seems to be the limited ability to schedule when alerts are sent (or more importantly, not sent).  One important note about installation is that while the systems is billed as wireless, you still need to run power to the cameras.  This means you need to have an outlet nearby.  This proved a problem for me given where I wanted to mount the outdoor camera.  I will eventually relocate it but it means I will have to run some cable (and also purchase additional cable beyond what is provided).  Not a huge deal, but something buyers should be aware of.One of the ultra cool features of this system is the available Android app.  This lets you view live or recorded video and it too works really well.I certainly wish I had this system a few years ago when some Landscape Rustlers made off with some newly planted bushes from right in front of my house.

The camera has worked fairly well during the six months I have had it. What I like most about the camera was its extremely easy installation. I plugged the wire into my ethernet and plugged the cord into the wall and installed it on the side of the house with the provided hardware.The camera works very well with my Macs and my iPad and iPhone after downloading the free app from the iTunes store.I use it predominantly on an old 2007 Mac Pro running 10.6.8. There are differences between the capability of the Alert Commander software for 10.6.8 and 10.7 and up. Most problematic is that you can't direct the movie files the Alert takes to a specific folder or drive under 10.6.8. It sends all those to your main drive in your \"Users/Movies\" folder. That is quite frustrating, as I would prefer to be able to dedicate an entire hard drive (secondary) to the movies and pictures. However, under later iterations of OS X you do have this capability.I like the fact that the camera does not appear to slow down my internet connection because it works over the electrical lines in the house rather than wifi alone. The pictures and movies it records are of medium quality... better than some security camera's I've seen. You can pan the area that you want to watch with the camera and set it to send alerts to  you if there is movement.I installed a 32 gb sd card into the camera as the standard 2 gb clearly would not be sufficient for long hours of recording. I leave the system on all the time and it sends me an email with a picture when there is movement. It seems to be very responsive to movement and will turn itself on to record the activity when there such. You can set the camera to the sensitivity that you want it to be triggered at for recording.It also has night vision, but I experienced a problem where once the night vision came on, it would not reliably revert back to regular vision during the day. So i have that feature turned off as we have enough lighting in the area where it is to get a good view of triggering events to recordings at night.The best feature is that if you have your computer turned off, the camera will still send you alerts. When you turn the computer on, the camera will then download the movies and pictures to the hard drive. I would like if the camera software automatically opened on its own without any input from the user. While you can set the Alert Commander software to open when the computer is started, you still have to click an \"OK\" button to actually open the viewing of the camera. This is problematic if you are, say on vacation and the computer restarts and there is no one there to push the button.Also, I have experienced some problems where the software will say that the SD card is not recognized and it has to be reformatted. This has happened several times... too many for comfort. What would happen if there were actual important recordings and the camera induced a SD card failure? This concern along with some limitations with the software, and unreliable night vision make me give the camera three stars, along with the fact that the recordings could be a little clearer.

First of all, it uses your house electrical wiring to transmit the video to your PC or MAC with a clever converter.  When you install the operating software, it is extremely well thought out and gives multiple options for how the information is managed; you can get an instant jpg of what the camera is looking at sent to your phone(s) and/or email(s) (multiples in both cases if desired).  This camera's night vision is impressive and low light capture is astonishing.  Its very good quality.  What I think really makes this system great is the way in which the software application displays activity by camera.  You have a simple bar graph with darker colored areas where the camera(s) picked up and recorded movement of something in its field of view and lighter colored where nothing was recorded, so you don't have to fast forward through hours of static view video to see something.  You just grab the slider bar and go directly to where the camera recorded and watch.  Traveling or home, this system will instantly notify you of anything warm that approaches from out to 100' or more in the form of a jpg snapshot to your smartphone of what it is recording.  This camera system (3 cameras) are installed in the home of a family member who is a State Trooper that works night shift.  He has comfort knowing his family is safe and he can tap in and see what's going on or not going on from his smartphone instantly from anywhere on the planet.

I have two outdoor cameras which are aimed at the front of house and rear/driveway.Initial Setup: very easy, not much technical knowledge required just mount the cameras and plug into the wall. The software walks you through everything step by step. Everything from the motion detection, recording destination, and updates are fairly easy to setup.TIP: the best way to get the wire into the house is through the molding of the windows. If you can route the wire under the vinyl siding you can drill a 1/2 inch hole through the plastic window frame (this will not affect the windows performance and function). This also allows the camera to be plugged indoors rather than outdoors where its is not susceptible to being unplugged.Picture Quality is very good, much better than most IP security cameras out there. But the best feature is the wide angle lens. It allows you to strategically place your cameras and capture a wider range whereas you would require extra cameras with most other cameras on the market.The app is great for viewing, I have had it installed on a few andriod devices. There are times when the app will freeze or is unable to retrieve the video but those hiccups are expected from any product which is transmitting data through the internet. FYI, the iOS app allows you to listen to sound, but the andriod app seems to not have this.Beware: The mounts that are supplied are no the best. The extension arm and ball joint are very lose thereby causing the camera to rotate out of position. The best way to mount the camera to avoid it rotating out of position is with the treading on the top of the camera and have it hanging rather then sitting on the mount. I will contact Logitech to inquire if there is a new and better mount.Security Recording: It is sometime very frustrating trying to locate the recording from the camera. There are times when I waited close to an hour just for the software to DL the recorded video from the cameras.

And from a reputable and trusted company as well.I rarely write reviews but felt compelled to voice my satisfaction with this system. I have never had a computer network related product work as flawlessly as this one. From the moment I opened the box, I had the first camera up and running within ten minutes. That includes perusing the quick-start guide and installing the software.I was immediately impressed with the quality of the video I was seeing. The frame rate is a bit low but more than adequate for surveillance purposes.The mounting hardware for the outdoor cameras gives you several options, including an extender arm, that should work in just about every installation. Once up, the cameras hold their positions securely.The software gives you plenty of flexibility when setting up motion-activated alerts. You can target specific areas in each camera's view as motion zones, thereby preventing waving tree limbs or pets from triggering alerts.Being cursed with no options for hard-wired broadband at our location, we are forced to use satellite broadband which usually wreaks havoc with any attempts to remotely access our computer. I was elated to find that all of our surveillance cameras were readily accessible from both our smart phones as well as any remote computer that we logged into our Logitech account from. The fact that our computer didn't even need to be turned on to remotely access the system was incredible.I did quickly realize why Logitech implemented the six camera limit that is inherent to these systems. There is a definite bandwidth limit, based on the quality and lengths of run of the electrical wiring being utilized. When you exceed that limit you will start seeing cameras drop out of the network sporadically along with slower frame rates. Our system worked flawlessly until the sixth camera was added. Subsequently, our furthest camera mounted in the garage would vanish from the network every few days. A simple reset of the camera would bring it back online. All in all, a relatively small glitch.We've had our cameras operating for a week now and I couldn't be happier.

It's not the typical \"apartment\" condo; mine is a detached one story ranch that looks like a single-family home.  We have HOA rules where we can't attach security cameras to the structure outside.  I hoped I could have outdoor security with this system by attaching the camera with the included suction cup to the inside of the window, facing outward.  But you can't. More on that later.NOTE:  You *can* use the NON-night vision indoor cameras attached to the windows facing outdoors, they work fine for daytime/dawn/dusk, but aren't good enough for complete darkness.Setting the system up is easy. You plug the camera into an outlet and either put the camera in its base, attach to the permanent hanger, or by suction-cup attachment to a window. The plug (a huge brick) leaves enough room so you can plug something else into the other receptacle opening.  There were a couple firmware upgrades that updated, and the software located my camera.Back to the indoor camera with night vision.  If you try to use this as an outdoor camera by attaching the suction cup so the camera faces outdoors, you will be sorely disappointed.  After dark you will see nothing but the reflection of the glass, it's almost mirror-like. An opossum walked across the yard, which also triggered my motion sensor porch light to come on, it was enough light where I could barely see what kind of animal it was, but I still had the reflection of the window. If it was a burglar, I doubt you could see much.But used INDOORS as this system SHOULD be used, these indoor night vision cameras excel.  The wide angle was enough where I could see the entire room (a 17' x 17' living room) in one view. A 7 watt nightlight was enough light to illuminate the room where you could see enough detail to identify a person. The HD was crisp. During the day, the views are in color, when the night vision kicks in, they are black and white.To use this system to its full capabilities, you'd have to subscribe to Logitech's Web and Mobile Commander which costs $80 a year. This is cheaper than what an alarm company would charge, but it all depends on what you want to use this camera system for to justify the extra expense.  To help deter vandalism or theft, the $80 could be money well spent. Using this as a nanny-cam, pet watcher, or to monitor an elderly person if you can't be there, you can probably get by with the free remote monitoring that's included with the system.I realize this is inexpensive compared to an alarm company wiring your home for a security alarm, but sometimes you get what you pay for - as this Logitech system can't be set up to inform the police department if you have a break-in.So my rating is:As a nanny-cam, pet/people watcher:  5 starsAs a home security system:  3 starsAverage:  4 stars", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's almost what I wanted; a bit expensive", "Author": "Ricky Lam", "ReviewID": "R1JHQFVHQZ6CW4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let's start with the good:  It's very easy to set up; I thought it was going to really hard as I have setup security camera before and it can get tricky.  The video quality is great but you can get ghost images when something move really fast in front of it.  The night version is awesome even in complete darkness I can see very clear images.  The quality of the camera is excellent as it has a metal shell protecting it and it's weather proof is a plus.  The alert is great and viewing it through my phone or desktop through their website is pretty cool.Now, it's the bad:  After paying about $350 for just 1 camera, Logitech stick it to you with another $80 yearly subscription fees for \"premium service\" which, I think, suppose to be included already with the software.  The software is very limited as you probably want to use a different software to view it.  I was recommended to Blue Iris but I haven't tried it yet.  Since the memory is in the camera and all the recorded video are recorded on there, if someone takes the camera, you have no evidences.  The $80 yearly subscription is just for you be able to view your recorded video but I wish it would able to save it onto Logitech server so in case the camera get stolen.  Sometimes Logitech server goes down and you wouldn't be able to view what's going on and have to rely on the recorded videos and you can view them when you get home or purchase the $80 subscription.I am debating either to keep the camera or not since it's going to get really expensive and I don't think their \"premium service\" is worth the $80; $30 I can see but sticking it to their customer at $80 is a bit much.

The camera comes with a really crappy 10 foot ethernet cable-- the flat ribbon kind. I ditched that for cat 6 standard cable. It fits very snugly in the camera (there is a weatherproof clam shell that clamps around the cable), but it fits. Also, the mounting instructions for the camera are just silly. They recommend mounting the camera under an overhang,and droping the powerline adapter down to a ground level adapter and plugging it in-- perfect reach for anyone to unplug it. I mounted my camera about 10 feet up, over the garage, drilled a small hole in the wall and ran the ethernet cable through, and plugged POE port inside.  If you can't drill a hole, I recommend mounting this above a flood or another outside fixture, and having an electrician install an outlet-- just make it high enough so someone can't unplug it.Other thoughts:Pros:*good video-- although the framrate could be a little higher (and there are no options to increase framrate)*Software is very easy to set up and intuitive. instantly found the camera*night vision is good, although you lose detail.

Shame, becuase the camera is really good build quality. makes the camera look cheap.*powerline adapters-- if you're going to use these, they are massive, and take up at least two spots on a standard power strip.

I was really surprised how well this system works, even though the network communication is through the house electric lines, the technology is perfected.The nightvision (IR) is pretty impressive, although the software does not allow for manually turning on Night Vision, the automatic control is fairly useful - you are able to manually turn off the night vision.I was really amazed of how easy the installation was. They included plenty of cable. All you need is a wired router with an extra port which goes to the master receiver, which converts the signal and sends it over your powerlines to the camera receiver. I planned for a full day of trouble shooting and playing around with the network - the whole thing took about 20 minutes, followed by placement and installation of the camera itself. I was even able to set up an account and watch my house on their Alert website, which setup was also a breeze (No messing around with DNS servers and complicated port forwarding).Video quality itself is pretty good. Its not 1080p, but it gets the job done. The audio is actually VERY impressive - you can hear conversations from at least 30 feet away. You can also turn the mic sensitivity down so that you don't pick up on neighbors or wind.I don't think this would be good for businesses as you can only have 6 cameras on the system. The other big reason is that the recording needs to go to a computer on the same network. While you can view the camera on their secure website, you can only store the recordings on a local computer, which could be damaged with an event which security viewing is needed.", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice cameras, but I am going for a more robust system ...", "Author": "microeconomics", "ReviewID": "RF6HU8LEPNELC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall, the cameras are good, the software is excellent and the ease of setup is pretty good.

The Logitech install doesn't allow for attic installation and an extension cord is not an option to mount the unit on the corner of my house.The main problem is that any security system is usually going to need to be mounted on the corner of a house or the corner of a building where an outlet (to connect the power) is no where to be found and is usually directly installed via the attic, or a high ceiling.These limitations make the camera more of a spot surveillance system instead of a dedicated serious unit.I would recommend a little more robust system for the money spent, if you are looking to simply spy on your teenage daughter and need a night vision camera that points in one direction, then this camera could fit the bill.The ability to record without the PC being on and the ability to stream to your iPhone make it a good teenager or simple spy camera to catch the neighbors dogs pooping in your lawn at night. In that regard, the software is really easy to use, the camera video quality is excellent, although night vision can be a little grainy ... I think this is due to a slightly underpowered IR light on the camera ....Other wise it is a solid build with easy hook up and directions.

Due to the camera's location, it was the easiest option without spending hours fishing cable through walls in order to mount the outdoor version.  Everything I read said this was possible, and it does work, except if you want to use the nightvision feature.  It wasn't until I opened the box that I found a little diagram stating that if you were going to set it up this way, nightvision needed to be disabled.  That was the first, and only, time I ever heard about this limitation.  Needless to say I was disappointed and almost returned the camera at that point.  A motion light was able to sidestep this limitation.Commander software:There is no other way to put this, but the software used to control the camera is terrible.  It is very limiting and 'clunky' to work in.  There is also no support for remote desktop connections, should you need to remote into your home computer and adjust settings.I've found the easiest way to review stored video is to avoid the software altogether, and go directly into the storage directory since the clips are stored in .MP4 format.  They can then be deleted or moved to another director for long term storage.**TIP:  If you have a google account, you have access to their Drive feature (cloud storage; 5GB free).  If you setup to have your storage directory sync'ed with the Drive account, you can access recorded video anywhere (and on most mobile devices).  This should safe you the $80/year Logitech charges if you want to be able to access stored video remotely.Alert Software:This is the software that allows you to view real-time video from mobile devices.

The outdoor camera equipped with night vision has real heft with its metal housing, wide-angle lens with red LED light, power pack, and router adapter to use your home's existing wiring instead of requiring you to run cables throughout your house.  It also comes with a set-up CD (Windows only, but more on Macs later), a 2 GB microSD card inside the camera, a micro-to-standard-SD adapter for reading the card, and the hardware needed to mount the camera.  Set-up couldn't be easier.  All you have to do is plug in the router power pack into an outlet and your router (via ethernet cable), and then plug your camera into a wall outlet near where you want to install it.  Install the software.  The set up wizard guides you through the necessary steps, including finding the cameras, and you're ready to go -- if you're lucky.  The first outlet I tried didn't work; the system couldn't find the camera.  (It is NOT a switched outlet, just a regular one.)  In fact, the camera couldn't work plugged into any of the outlets in that room.  Fortunately, the next choices all worked.  Note:  this is not a true wireless system since the cameras are not battery-operated.  Each must be plugged into an outlet.The software is powerful in what you can do with the cameras.  Without repositioning the cameras themselves, you can \"nudge\" the viewing field right or left; expand or contract it by zooming in or out; select custom areas for motion detection (more on that later); customize alerts; turn sound on or off; adjust motion sensitivity (again, more); and playback short recorded clips activated by motion.  The color daytime video is excellent; you'll be able to identify anyone approaching the camera, unlike some of those grainy images you see on news reports.  The night vision is disappointing because it doesn't have a good range, although a semi-lit area will give enough definition to see an intruder.So what are the issues?  Well, first you have to pay a subscription fee of $79 per year to use all of the features.  Unless you have this, you will receive email alerts that motion has been detected without any way to see what your cameras have caught.  (With a subscription, you can get a snapshot, although sometimes even that is not revealing.)  The subscription also lets you manage your cameras remotely, either via an app downloaded on your smart phone or on a computer outside your home network.  The iPhone app is excellent -- I can view the camera live or I can playback the clip triggered by the motion, and I can turn the alerts on and off.  That means that when I'm away from the house, I can turn on alerts so I know when someone has approached the house.  Although the cameras are always recording on the microSD or, if your computer is on, on your computer, you can see whether you should call the police or not.  Purchase of the master set comes with a free 7 day trial of the Web/Mobile Commander.  Alerts are sent by email only, not text messages.  These cameras are almost useless without the subscription, so plan on getting it or finding a different security system.  Logitech would generate a lot of good will if it included a one-year subscription.  After all, most people will want to continue after having gone through the trouble of installing the cameras.Next, the motion detection software is wonky.  I have one camera trained in part on my driveway.  It doesn't always catch me pulling in and out of the driveway.  In fact, more often than not, it only picks up only one of the two, and it's not predictable which one.  And it did not pick up my walking up the driveway, although it did catch a car outside of the field and much farther away. But the motion detector DOES pick up shrub branches blown by the wind.  This means that something big like a car entering my property is not picked up but that shrubs can generate alerts every minute.  Boy, was that annoying to see on my cell phone email account.  As another test, I passed my hand in front of the camera three times, with a speed and distance as constant as I could, several minutes apart.  The detector picked only one of the three passes, yet a few minutes later, it picked up a tiny bird flying in.  I've tried to adjust the motion sensitivity, and I just can't seem to find the right balance.  If Logitech can improve the motion detection, this system will warrant four stars.Another issue:  sometimes I get an alert, but the commander can't play it back.Mac Users: Logitech often makes life difficult for Mac users by not providing compatible software for many of their products.  Here, the good news is that, while the Logitech Alert system requires a Windows-based PC for initializing and finding cameras, you can then switch to a Mac to adjust all the settings.  The Windows PC does not need to be on to access live feed from the cameras.  Still, I find Logitech's refusal to acknowledge the growing Mac population offensive.  Although I didn't remove any points for this (after all, the description clearly states that a Windows PC is needed for set up), it makes me feel better having voiced it.You can add on up to six (pricey) cameras, either indoor (no night vision) or outdoor.  The fish-eye type lens of these cameras can shoot a wide angle if you set it up that way, but most homeowners will want to purchase several to sufficiently cover entrances and vulnerability points.  Small business owners with one, open main area can probably get away with one camera, although in that case I recommend the outdoor camera that comes with this set since it has both night vision and a wider viewing field.  The night vision does not work well when the camera is near low-level lighting; the lights \"blind\" the camera, even if they aren't bright.Last, there is an inherent flaw in a security camera that must be plugged into a wall outlet to work.  What's to stop a thief from yanking out the power pack?  Although the camera will record up until that moment, you won't be able to access it.  And if the power goes out or is cut, you won't have any video, either.  At the very least, these cameras should have a battery backup with a remote low battery warning.  So, while you may not need an electrician to install the system, you may want to hire one to install outlets high enough off the ground -- and then pray that the wiring connects to the router.  In the meantime, I strongly recommend that you train your camera on an area that includes all approaches to the outlet.  A back-up battery system or true wireless would nudge this in the five star range.If you are considering purchasing this security system, you should price it with all the extra cameras you think you'll need and the subscription service.  You will be acting as your own security company, which means that you should have constant access to email when you're away from home.  Make sure you have programmed your local police number into your phone.  You will pay a lot less for this system than you would for a professional service; however, you must also be willing to deal with the trade-offs of a do-it-yourself security system.  4- stars.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "Date": "February 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Limited usefulness without paying $79.99 / year for complete functionality", "Author": "Qin Dalong \"Jon\"", "ReviewID": "RY9U5P4XBCPXH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I must admit I feel rather ripped off after paying for this main outdoor unit and an indoor unit and then finding that even investing $500 in this system I still need to pay $79.99 in order to get full functionality.

I have the cameras connected to a TRENDnet 8-Port 10/100Mbps PoE Switch (4x 10/100, 4x 10/100 PoE) and it works great.  I would highly recommend a PoE switch for installation.ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:This is a very nice security system with some really great possibilities.  You can connect up to six cameras to the system and record the video to your computer hard drive for storage.  The cameras themselves use micro-SD cards for offline storage as well, so you have options.  You can view the live video from the cameras on your local computer with the Logitech Alert Commander software, via the internet on [...], or via the mobile client on your Android, Blackberry, or iPhone.The base system comes with one camera, power supply, network adapter, and Logitech Alert Commander software.  The review system came with an additional indoor camera (700i) in order to allow reviewers to set up a system with multiple input points.INSTALLATION:The installation is basically a no-brainer and the system didn't take any time to set up.  The cameras communicate via powerline ethernet which runs the data through your existing electrical outlets to your router.  This setup allows you to install the cameras anywhere there is an electrical outlet without worrying about running cables through your house.  The master system comes with the powerline-to-ethernet connector that you connect to your router, any additional cameras come with powerline adapters that communicate with the master.NOTE: YOU MUST CONNECT THE ADAPTERS DIRECTLY TO A WALL OUTLET.  THE ADAPTERS WILL NOT WORK IF PLUGGED INTO A SURGE SUPPRESSOR.  The instructions tell you this, but I decided to test it and they were not kidding; it does not work.I am awaiting information from Logitech about installing the powerline adapters in the attic in order to hide all wires.  I will update the review when I find out if the adapters can be installed in that manner.UPDATE: Logitech got back to me - the adapters CANNOT be installed in the attic.SETUP:The setup is pretty straight forward.  You connect the cameras to the powerline adapters and connect the ethernet cable from the master powerline adapter to your modem.  The Logitech Alert Commander software will find the cameras that you connect and you can then name them and they are ready to view.Adding cameras is as simple as plugging the camera cable into the powerline adapter, plugging that adapter into the wall, and then using the software to discover the new camera.  It is dead simple.CAMERA FIRMWARE:The camera firmware was out of date on the cameras I was sent.  Luckily, it is extremely easy to update the firmware.  Simply open the Logitech Alert Commander software, select \"Settings,\" select \"General,\" select \"Updates,\" and then click \"Update Cameras.\"  You can also update your software from the same location.SOFTWARE:The Logitech Alert Commander software is fairly intuitive, but setting up recording to your computer is not automatic.  You must define a path for the audio/video stream or it will not record at all.  The path can be set by going to \"Settings,\" selecting \"Storage,\" then \"Computer.\"  The \"Video location\" box will have information entered into it, but it will not work.  You MUST define a path for the video by selecting \"Browse\" and setting up a file path.NIGHT VISION:The night vision seems to work very well.  I tested the 750e in the dark and it was able to pick up pretty good detail.  The image is not the best in the world, but it is a lot better than expected and the range is pretty good.VIEWING VIA PHONE OR WEB:This is a great feature and one that I will use often.  You simply set up an account when you install the Logitech Alert Commander software on your computer and then use that login information on the phone or the web to view live video from the cameras.  This works surprisingly well and I am quite impressed with it.  There is also a premium version where you can use Web and Mobile Commander to view recorded video and control your system remotely.  I have not looked into the cost of this, but it is a very good feature if you want to have complete remote control of the system.BOTTOM LINE:This is an excellent security system and it will work very well for pretty much anyone.  The price is a bit higher than many other systems if you want to install multiple cameras, but it is certainly very high quality.OVERALL RATING: 4.5/5 (reduced 1/2 star for price)HIGHLY RECOMMENDED", "Date": "September 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Two Cameras, both no good", "Author": "Dan in Mass", "ReviewID": "R18MVJRLZFZJTY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased two of the outdoor 700e cameras along with the Logitech Alert 750e Outdoor Master Security System with Night Vision on September 27th; video quality is just ok but has way too many false alarms.

We're not talking 1080p, but good enough to identify faces. I forget the frame rate but movement is smooth and not blurred. Night vision is also of stellar quality. The wide angle is enough and not exaggerated.I wish the stand allowed for more precise camera orienting. Right now I'm using bits of paper to wedge the camera in the stand at an angle that works for my needs. A ball joint would have been perfect (for that I give it 4 stars).I've also installed the mobile app to be able to check in on the camera at any time.So the camera natively stores the footage on board it's external micro SD memory slot. It will only upload to your computer when you launch the software on your computer. I had hoped to upload the footage to cloud storage but that would require my computer to be constantly on with the Logitech software running. I guess right now if someone were to break into my apt, they could steal the camera and thus all of the footage. I would only have a few pictures if my alerts were timed accordingly.

The software that comes with it is lacking but will do what the average consumer requires. I have a server in may basement and wanted to be able to use it to control the cameras and store the video. There is no API for programmers to support the cameras and add features, which I think is the biggest downside. These could really have more of a following if they offered an API. I have had a few cases where the camera stopped working. Once it was from the cable going bad, another was due to an ice storm.  I warmed up the camera and it starting working again, I really think it was just the unplugging and replugging that did it. I did have a camera completely die on me and Logitech replaced it for me. It has worked well since.There are days the camera stays in night vision because it thinks it is night time. Might be the cloud cover or shadows that make to too dark.I have missed recording some important situations because I have setup motion zones that were not where the motion occurred. This was because I didn't want an alert for every car that drives by my house, but that meant the one car that does crash into the yard won't be caught either.So it is a balance of finding the settings that work best. Rain and snow cause me to wake up to hundreds of email alerts.Installing and running the cameras is easy, streaming on the Logitech site, on mobile, or at home is easy. Everything is easy, except for getting the settings exactly how you want them. The balance between security and too many alerts.I think that the command software forgets what files are videos and goes past the limits you set to the max amount of video that can be saved, but I can not confirm it.

I loved the fact that you could simply plug it in to a wall socket and not have to run cables. But, over time, all but one of my six camera died, and all of them died outside the warranty period. hen the new Logitech alert cameras came out I was reluctant to purchase them due to past experience. But the fact that they were higher-definition, power-line transmitting cameras eventually persuaded me to try a few cameras. I purchased one exterior 700e camera and a package with two interior 700n cameras. These cameras have infrared capability so you can see images quite clearly at night. The Commander software package is excellent. The ability to hear sound (these camera have a microphone built-in) is nice, too. I have had one camera fail under the warranty period. I'd guess the infrared emitter stayed on and cooked the internals - the camera was too hot to even touch. I called the Logitech service desk about a warranty return and had the usual \"is it plugged in\" routine from the non-native-English speaking person behind the phone. After they received my camera (Logitech paid for the UPS shipment) I was sent an exterior camera which I had to return. I was eventually sent the cheaper, non-infrared camera which I again returned. In my emails back and forth with Customer Service I'd once mistakenly referred to my bad camera as the 700i, the non-infrared camera. Even though they had the proper model number in their system the Customer Service rep had to tell me that it was MY mistake that they'd sent me the wrong camera. Really? Long story short, I hope you have good luck and have to avoid contacting Customer Service.

I do like the online and mobile access though. The system itself is pretty easy to set up and install. The only other small gripe I can't decide if it's good or bad but the system only records when it sense motion then it stops and for some reason all the motion videos don't always record to the hard drive. You will have some from today and some from a few days ago but the ones in the middle it won't let you play.

The first monitors our front door and we use the second as a video baby monitor for our infant son's room.  The installation and set-up is super easy, just plug and play.  You do need to follow the instructions that tell you to NOT use power strips.  The cameras use the electrical wiring in your home to distribute the signals and power strips interfere with this.  The software is idiot proof.  Each camera can be configured independently for it's use.For our front door application, we found that the night vision doesn't work.  The front porch lights wash out the night vision.  But the front porch lights provide enough illumination for the camera to see at night.  We have this camera configured to email during certain times of the day when it sense motion; so we have lots of funny picture of the UPS man.  In this application we have the audio turned off so that it doesn't record noise from around the house.  The camera only records when it senses motion and the software allows you easily navigate the video logs.  We recently had a pet sitter come and I checked the logs to see when and how long she was there.  The latest version of the iOS app allows you to change the alert settings from you phone, as long as you already have alerts activated through the computer software interface.In our Son's room we use the night vision and the audio.  In my opinion it is a great baby video monitor as long as you have a traditional audio only monitor to provide continuous sound monitoring.  When I want to spy on baby I just open the app on my phone or tablet and within 30 seconds I have streaming video.  Plus when baby grows up we can use the camera somewhere else in the house.One of our cameras did recently stop working.  I contacted Logitec customer support and they were very helpful in troubleshooting the issue.  Ultimately the camera was replaced by Logitec.

I am on the second floor and have the camera mounted on the deck. I choose the Logitech one after looking around because i usually love Logitech products and I really only wanted ONE camera, with as much quality/features as possible.Setup- Super easy.  Plus and Play basically, all you need a is a screwdriver to open these panels that hide/protect the connector for the Ethernet cable and to screw it into what ever you want to mount it on.  The networking through the power lines works really well so far.  I have my router plugged into a Tripp Lite PS3612 Power Strip and then the camera is outside on just a standard outdoor rated wall outlet. It successfully connects every time that Ive tried it so far. I tried it in the bathroom on a GFI plug when it first arrived to test out the night vision cause i felt like that was the easiest room to make completely dark since it had no windows.Quality- The camera feels really well built and not flimsy.  Feels like you don't have to baby it, and could take some light beating if you accidentally drop it on the floor (not going to test that, I do baby it.) All the water proofing cover for the cables are a nice touch.  I don't think this is designed to be in direct rain, it states it is Weatherproof, not Waterproof.  There are screw spots on both sides (top and bottom) so I think that could hold water if you had it out in direct rain and possibly leak into the case. So In my situation i will need to be sure to have something over it (its under partial soffit ATM, feel like ill need/want more though.)UPDATE: I used this for about a week and ultimately returned it.  It was good, but not what i was looking for.  While i could definitely see the people in the parking lot, the image quality was not high enough to positively ID a person or license plate 50 ft away, and thats what I wanted out of it.I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a camera to just watch over items or see if someone is driving up the lane.", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Quality, Setup As advertised", "Author": "Theodore Andersen \"Ted\"", "ReviewID": "R5RBHN0Z5AVE5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose the Logitech Alert night vision line based on reviews.

I would recommend it to a friend due to the ease of set up. Everthing you need is in the box. Included software is adequate. The motion detection is too sensitive. Picture quality is merely OK. Ability to tune in to the camera on your phone/tablet sorta fun for a minute and makes physically adjusting the view of the camera from the top of a ladder easy.  Long version: The rating is mainly derived from the inability to truly adjust the motion sensitivity feature of the camera. *Edit/Update 12/9/13: The latest firmware update did improve the motion detection feature. The motion detection sensitivity slider found in the software settings actually has some purpose now.* While I'm using the camera with a power over ethernet injector, I did try the included electrical wiring data adapters and they worked well. The picture quality is OK I'm not blown away. I temper my thoughts concerning picture quality with the knowledge that I received an entire security camera solution in a box for about the same money as a semi-decent point and shoot digital camera. Installation of the software (software is windows PC only I believe) went fine and the software detected the camera straight off. After finalizing the hardware install and reconnecting the camera the software was unable to detect the camera but simply cycling power to the camera solved the issue. I you must do this, give the camera several minutes to boot. Ease of hardware install will vary of course. A drill motor/bits and screw drivers are all that were needed in my case. Keep in mind that using the included electrical wiring data/power adapters does not negate the need to run a cable to the exterior of your building if the camera will be used outside.Technically an external power outlet could be used with one of the included adapters but, I don't think that solution is viable for security concerns or the longevity of the adapter in most cases as the adapters do not appear to be weather proof.

Not sure what camera parameters are involved but even in ideal conditions the motion detection provides a picture where the thing/person detected is just a blur.Both of these seem correctable, but after forum search looking at other's complaints going back quite a ways I would have to say that Logitech does not appear to be responsive.There are cheaper systems if all you want to do is get a general \"comfort level\" view of your property.", "Date": "October 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Logitech 700e outdoor", "Author": "Karel K", "ReviewID": "RZL1WQ1SRZGZ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Product arrived via UPS on time.Packaging was nice, all pieces there, nothing missing, except the user manual, which was not needed.When setting the Camera, be prepard to change some of the programming left from previous owner.The best is, of course, the price, about $100 cheaper then retail.Product itself is great for security applications, the best picture for the price.

I got one indoor camera and three of the outdoor models - one of which I actually have inside.  I really wish I had gone with all outdoor cameras.  I've found the indoor camera to essentially be useless without the infrared recording features that the outdoor models have.  Seems like every reason I've had to review captured footage has resulted in...  well, no footage.  Not enough light, so the camera is blind.  Not a problem with the outdoor models - great day and nighttime recording.  And the audio is a big plus.  You'd be surprised at what people who are doing things they shouldn't be doing talk about - more things they shouldn't be doing that are good to have a heads-up on.  I can pick-up audio on my roof-mounted outdoor cameras, even when the talkers aren't within the view of the cameras.The system isn't perfect.  I really wish Logitech would expand it to offer functionality to Mac users (I bought a Windows-based laptop just to run the Alert system) - which is the only reason I knock them a star.  I've had a few issues with the system failing to \"find\" the cameras...  Nothing various combinations of restarting the software, the computer and/or the cameras hasn't fixed.  And after about a year and a half, I've had to start replacing failed Micro SD cards - 2 so far.  I'm guessing the cards just reached their maximum write cycle, and it's not necessarily a reflection of quality or lack thereof.  I got four new cards (planning for the next expected fail) - even upgraded the original 2GB cards to 8GB - on Amazon for under $40 bucks.  WIth on-going costs of running this system essentially being $0 (live viewing of the cameras online through Logitech's servers and optionally emailed snapshots of motion-triggered recordings are FREE), that's a maintenance cost I can live with.  I didn't even bother with Logitech support to see if they'd replace the cards.  I do pay a minimal monthly fee ($5/mo) for a third-party cloud backup that runs every minute, so if a security \"incident\" results in the loss of my memory cards and the PC the footage lives on (the dedicated PC runs Alert 24/7), I should have record of how it happened with an off-site backup.I'm happy with the system overall, and the outdoor cameras are great.

I wanted an easy to install high quality security camera that would log activity. Opening the box to check the contents, you can't help but notice a lot of thought went into the packaging. My hopes were  high at this point. Removing the various parts of the system, it was also obvious there was a lot of thought in the engineering design. Everything was well made, and even the screws used to keep access hatches on the camera and camera powere box were held in place after unscrewed so you couldn't lose them.I installed in under 2 hours. Software load was smooth, system start up uneventful and routine. Camera works well, has a very good quality image, and the motion detector works well and doesn't go off all the time. There were a lot of things that could go wrong in a system like this, and none did. I'm a happy customer. I know I'll be looking for another camera and wish the price wasn't so high, though. $330 or the system and $270 for a second camera? You need to work that down. I can watch live from anywhere on the net even with my home computer off with images sent over my home network directly from the camera. I'm receiving email notices of motion detector activity and learning how to set the motion alrm threshold to reduce alerts even furhther. Most alarms set off by insects visiting the infrared lights overnight. I'm thinking if I turned the camera lights off and installed seperate light 10 feet away, almost all motion alerts logged overnight would stop. Haven't signed up for the $80/year ability to reveiw the historical log yet, but don't think that's too bad a price for that aility given what a security frim would charge me for the same capability.If you want an easy to install one camera system that is fully functional and a snap to install, look no further!

Over a dozen emails, several phone calls and weeks later I got my cameras to come back. That was January. Now it is August and guess what? My $80.00 web commander quit working. This is the second time the clock has been ticking on my useless, expensive subscription. This system is forever knocking cameras offline and getting them back online is frustrating beyond reason.

I have removed viruses from friend's computers, I have repaired broken computers, but I assure you correcting problems (and, trust me, you will have problems) with this system is NOT user friendly and fixing it will steal many. many DAYS from your life that you'll never get back. Do you think it is a good idea to hang the outside cameras out of reach? Think again! Because every time there's a problem (and you WILL have them) you'll be getting a ladder and removing the screws to access the tiny re-set hole in the back of each camera for which you'll need a paper clip to poke into the hole to re-set it knocking it askew on its flimsy mount in the process. Logitech calls this \"paper clipping\" your cameras. And you WILL be doing it periodically. And, it doesn't always work! And, yes, my power and band width are fine, so don't even go there. Even when the cameras are working the night vision simply doesn't capture any detail at all in moving objects. Kind of a bummer because if you needed to catch a perpetrator on video at night even if they're moving very slowly they'll still be just a bunch of indecipherable streaks. Faces? Forget it.

One major requirement was the ability to view remotely via web and smart phone. Then I saw the logitech system in Best Buy and was impressed, so checked out the reviews on Amazon and was sold.  It is considerably cheaper on Amazon than at Best Buy (as is most things, it seems), so I ordered the main system with one camera and an additional camera.  The installation was incredibly easy - I ran the line into the garage and into a socket and I was done.  The computer setup was incredibly simple; not real tech experience required.  It feeds it to the webviewer automatically (which is viewable free in an app for my android smart phone). It also send emails with snapshots to my wife and I whenever it detects motion.

They answered the phone quickly and there was no long wait times when calling. They walked me through a few simple trouble shooting things and then asked me to download a diagnotic report from the software to send over to them.  Its a nice feature and then got back to me quickly within 24hrs with the results.The Level 2 tech told me I should return the camera since the camera was not setup with a MAC address and wont read. They told me to return the camera for a new one. So I did.So then I drove to anotehr best buy about 60 miles from where I got my first camera to not have the issues if it was a bad lot of number. I was excited to get home and try it again. I get home and plug in the camera to search and the same (light blue) light on the bottom of my camera.  Called customer service did some troubleshotting and again they asked to send a diagnotic report to them.  I did that and again they said there was an issue (different from the first issue) which the camera and internet weren't networking.Customer service has now asked me to send the camera directly back to them and they will replace it with a new camera. I was a little hesitant to do this since best buy only has a 30 day return policy on the camera and if something happens in the mail I am out the $400 bucks I had paid.Customer service assured me they would take responsability if camera gets lost or if I want my money back if I dont like the camera once I get it.

Overall, a good product-the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is b/c it is on the higher end price wise (Especially b/c you only get one camera with the system purchase).", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good system, bad picture", "Author": "Harbinger", "ReviewID": "R3ITYYJC28R28N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The overall system works well - it is simple to install and the iPhone app works great, a very cool feature. The fundamental problem with the Logitech 700e Outdoor Master Security System with Night Vision is the bad picture quality. I cannot see the license plate number of a car parked barely 15 feet away (day or night). So the camera may be good for closeup pictures, like watching a door just a few feet away, but do not buy this camera if you need to see license plates of cars or anything of that nature. Also, the sound quality is not great.To improve this system, Logitech will have to allow for greater customization of the images the camera captures - I'd sacrifice color quality for clarity (the colors are vibrant but the picture is blurry). Another item that should be improved is the camera's motion sensor - it is too sensitive.  But I recently found the \"Advanced\" section of the camera motion area and saw that you can lower the sensitivity, which I've done, so we'll see how it goes.  At 50 (the middle, factory setting), if a large bug flies by at night, you get a recorded video event. If there's rain, you get a recorded event as long as rain drops are falling in front of the camera (hours of video capture).  Another frustration is the playback (looking at recorded events through the Logitech software program).  The picture is so staccato that if you're looking at a car that drove by at some point in the night, you can barely see what kind of car it was - not because of the lighting but because it's a blur.  Maybe there's a way to get it to take a higher frequency of pictures to make it more like a movie, but I haven't found that option in the software yet.  I'll have to talk to Logitech or search online to find out if recorded video can be transferred to Apple iMovie or a program like that to improve it, but my sense is that the original video is too low in quality.Ultimately the camera is good if you just want to see the basics of what is going on in its field of view, but don't get it if you really want to see details (over 5 feet away).

Everything was extremely easy to set up and install.  I initially set up each cam at my computer, plugged into the same power strip as the receiver.  This allowed the cams to efficiently update their firmware and become part of the system.  I then simply relocated each cam to its designated location, mounted them and plugged in their power supplies.  Works great! I was pleasantly surprised, since my house is over 100 years old and some of the circuits I'm using are *at least* 50 year old wiring.The indoor cam has no night vision, and the outdoor cam's night vision isn't very good.  I have outdoor security lighting, however, which allows the cam to record in full color and resolution all night--it never has to switch to IR. My lighting consists of one mercury \"night light\" (a street light), augmented by several ordinary fluorescent wall-mounted carriage lights.My indoor cam is mounted on a window adjacent to my front door.  Looking through plexiglass does degrade the image somewhat, but it's quite usable and lets us know when someone approaches the door, leaves a package, etc.The motion detection on each camera allows you to specify your own areas of interest and select the sensitivity (or object size) for generating an alert.  This was especially important for me, since one of the cams can see the street, causing cars passing by to repeatedly set off alerts until I specified a tighter zone for motion detection.My indoor cam does generate alarms and record snapshots-- but the local commander application doesn't receive these as it does for the outdoor cam.  Logitech customer support was very helpful, and is sending me a replacement memory chip to hopefully fix this problem.  Interestingly, the web service can see all of the alerts and snapshots-- only the local commander has a problem.  Unfortunately, there is no \"refresh\" or \"re-synch\" function in the commander.  The web service queries the memory chip on the camera directly, explaining why it can see snapshots which the local commander may have missed.Picture quality is much better than I expected.  Motion detection is easy to configure and works perfectly.  Snapshots back up slightly before the motion was detected, allowing you to see exactly what was going on.  I'm having the web service send snapshots to a dedicated email address when alerts occur.  Each email includes a hot link to the corresponding video, allowing you to quickly review what was recorded for each event.  It couldn't be any easier...My Android phone receives the emails and can \"sometimes\" see the cameras-- but the Android app still seems a bit unstable.  When it works, it's great.  My Ipad, on the other hand, seems to handle the Alert app seamlessly, making it a great way to view the cameras when you're away from the commander PC.  If you pay the $80/year fee, the web interface (which also includes Android & Ipad apps) gives you all of the functionality of the local commander, with anywhere-you-go accessibility.  The only issue is video resolution-- HD is available only at the local commander. I haven't run into any situations yet where the additional resolution would be needed in order to identify what's going on, but still, it's nice to have when you need it.I just ordered 2 more cameras, which should give me adequate coverage for the outside of the house.  I don't  plan to use any of these inside, but I've tested the cams indoors (just for fun) and was very impressed with their output.So far, I'm having a great time with the cameras.  It's like having an extra window to the outside-- including live sound (if you activate it).  Hearing what's going on outside while I'm at my desk is almost as helpful as having the video feeds.  I can hear the dogs barking, trucks arriving, doors opening, etc.Great system, great price!Postscript:I now have 4 cameras, all working great.The synchronization problem turned out to be a flash update issue which Logitech is currently trying to solve-- but there's a workaround.  Three of my cameras somehow got their time zones confused, causing the Commander program to reject their snapshots.  When I reviewed the snapshots on their web site, I noticed that these cameras showed motion alerts *in the future*... LOL  Once I mentioned it was a timezone problem to the help desk, they recognized the problem immediately and sent me the procedure needed to reset the cams and resynch them with the Commander.  This worked, and now Commander can see all of the alerts-- and the cams are reporting the correct timestamps online.Post-Postscript:It's been two years since I installed my first cameras.  I now have eight Logitech Alert cameras -- three indoor and five outdoor models.  Logitech's software only supports six per console-- and your house electrical wiring will probably max out at about the same number.  I started experimenting with Power-Over-Ethernet (POE) options (these cameras support that just fine), and now only one camera uses the house wiring.  The rest connect to my house LAN using direct wiring or wifi and POE injectors or switches (TP-Link AC TL-PoE150S POE Injector and TRENDnet 8-Port 10/100Mbps PoE Switch, both sold here)to provide both LAN and power to the cameras.  I have three cameras in a remote garage which use a gaming adapter to receive the wifi from the house and feed the POE switch.Logitech software still works with the POE connection, but limits you to six cameras per view.  Initially, I set up two workstations and divided the cameras between them.  But then I learned about Blue Iris software from the Logitech online forum.  Blue Iris can handle a much larger number of cams (99?) from a wide variety of vendors, including Logitech.  I *love* the Blue Iris interface, and have been running it now for almost a year.  To view your cameras on your smart phone or over the web, you have to open up outside connectivity to a PC at your house, but if you do this it works great.  Blue Iris lets you zoom in and out and supports a variety of desktop configurations depending on the number of cameras you have.

Since the initial setup was so smooth, I've ordered more indoor cameras for the house.  Right now the outdoor camera is in my garage that is at the back of our 1/2 acre lot (router is in the basement of the house, about 155 feet away) and it's been working fine so far. The microphone is so sensitive that I can hear birds chirping outside of the garage.I agree with others that the $79.99 per year Alert Web Commander subscription is a bit pricey but I have not tried it yet.  I will probably get around to at least checking it out with the seven day free trial. For now, the email alerts and ability to view activity online will do. My elderly Blackberry will not support the free app, but it's about time for it to retire anyway. ;-)Overall, while I wish it were less expensive <grin> but I think it will provide me with peace of mind when I am away from home.Update 3-24-11 - One inside camera returned Tuesday and outdoor replacement ordered. No sooner done than the other indoor camera started misbehaving.  Drops off the network, has to be re-booted by physically unplugging it and replugging it. Using the \"find cameras\" does not work for it (just like the other one) and now, even though I can monitor real time and it gives audible alerts, it is not recording.  Bah!

Lots of data (the names of your cameras, their usernames/passwords, etc) are saved on Logitech's servers.  That's a bit scary because I don't know what they're doing with the data.. are they watching it too?  are a group of them flipping between hundreds of feeds without their manager's approval?When you use Logitech's website (or the iphone app) to remotely view the cameras, it continuously makes you click the \"Continue\" button to verify that you're still watching the video.  It's a real hassle because I have a monitor set up specifically to watch the feed and every 5 minutes i have to click the button to keep it going.With the simpler cameras, you connect directly to your home router and that's it.  Granted, it's a bit more technical to configure.  You can still do that, though, if you want to configure a RTSP client like VLC.  Choose Media -> Open Network Stream and enter rtsp://admin:@/HighResolutionVideo (or /LowResolutionVideo)I am very happy with the video and audio quality.Motion Detection/Recording is dreadful.  On any motion - any at all - you get a recording saved.  This makes finding what you're looking for a nightmare because you have to sift through 1,000 files per day.

By remote control from your pc you can adjust the camera up, down, right or left.  I would estimate you can move the viewing by maybe 10% in any direction.  You can zoom in or out, with very good quality.  The motion detector can be adjusted to be more or less sensitive.I have pictures sent to my Blackberry Torch cell phone and email.  This is a very cool feature, but I haven't quiet optimized the number of images sent / motion sensitivity yet.  That is I get a fair number of false motion detections, so with my current settings I get about 4 to 10 images a day.  Of those maybe one or two is an image with human movement.  I believe the other images are sent due to high winds / rain, small animals like cats or squirrels etc. There are a lot of adjustments to minimize the numers sent, motion zone, motion senstivity, seconds of movement etc.My partner has an IPhone and get live streaming images from each of the cameras to his phone.

You can't control the times you want to receive alerts. So if you set alerts on any of the cameras, you could get 300 emails a day. You can't assign static IP addresses to any of the cameras. Their IPhone Alert app is a joke. You'd be lucky to have it connect and stream video 30% of the time. That's with all components being updated with the latest firmware and software updates. And when the streaming does work, it's 18 to 30 seconds behind your live video. That's a long delay if there was anything really happening to your home, business or cars. It's like calling the police and saying an intruder broke into my house 30 seconds ago. And the dispatcher asking you \"Are they still in the house\" and all you can say is \"give me 30 seconds and I'll let you know\". Buy the time you make the call and the police get out to your house, the intruders will be gone. Or, you get an email saying an alert event found motion on camera 1 which is looking at you cars. You log into the website or use the IPhone app that is 18 to 30 seconds behind and the intruders are gone by the time you get the alert or see the video. This could be a great system if they did a total redesign of their software. Oh, I almost forgot the annual charge of $80 dollars for their software. I would not recommend the product in its current state.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "worst cameras every", "Author": "ggg", "ReviewID": "R3GS50VPHWTXID", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i bought this system (2 750e outdoor cameras) for quite a lot of money (not cheap at all) with the intention that i wanted to invest into something for my business that would provide excellent results.

I installed the cameras ontop of the roof of my business on both corners, so overlooking the whole shop but out of reach from any unwanted visitors. the area is extremely dangerous so i needed the cameras for security of inventory left out overnight. they worked fine for the first 2-3 months then came the pain. They dont record, you cant view online or in logitech commander, they are pretty much just plastic boxes that are wired up. I thought these were outdoor cameras, when it would get anywhere close to \"hot\" the cameras would stop working, lets not even talk about snow. I would spend hours with techs support and \"all i needed to do is press the reset button\" on the underside of the camera...to bad for me that they are completely out of reach. did i mention both cameras are covered so they are not directly exposed to the elements. And then the story begin..every 2-3 days the cameras stop working and after reseting them close to 100 times (which took an hour to grab ladders, wait for logitech to register them, adjust the view) in a 4 month period..i have given up so they are just there not working. and tech support doesn't know why they wont work.

I used a motion detected night light with the camera to make the nighttime picture a little better. I can watch the live picture via a computer or a smartphone easily.

While the very basic functionality of having a local security camera system usually works (~85-90% of the time?), it is not without many reoccurring issues.-Cameras commonly lose time sync with the Commander PC, making video playback essentially useless (videos show up with completely incorrect timestamps). For instance, if my camera thinks it's the year 2010, I have to go searching back in my stored footage from 2010 to see the video that was JUST recorded. There is no timestamp on the actual video playback to give any clue when your footage is being stored in an incorrect location/date.-The online/remote viewing applications only work about 60-70% of the time. It's great that there is an iPad app, but more often than not, it tells me that I don't have any cameras set up. If I wait long enough for Logitech to pull themselves back together, I can log in without making any changes and it'll work as if there was never an outage at all.-The customer support is a joke. If you're on the fence about a security product, do yourself a favor and check the forums (at [...] ) and see just how many people are being given ridiculous workarounds and apologies for issues that they can't explain.In summary, the camera hardware is nice, but is backed by faulty/problematic firmware. The software that you're supposed to use to monitor/control it is pretty to look at, but unreliable and severely lacking. A common trend that you'll observe in the Logitech support forums is that people that are stuck with these cameras are moving on to a non-Logitech software application to run them (separate licensing fees required).

Unfortunately, the building is old and didn't have outside power outlets (this is totally my fault, I should have checked first).  Considering the wiring nightmare we could have, I eventually installed it at my home.ProsThe picture quality during the day time is amazing.  I was expecting the kind of video you often see on police shows where you can't tell what anything really is.  The picture quality from this camera is much better than anything I have seen on outdoor monitoring equiptment.  I also love the zoom option.  The night vision quality wasn't nearly as good, but was still okay.The system didn't require a lot of technical knowledge to setup.  I was pretty worried that I'd have a lot of issues with compatibility, hardware, etc., but it was pretty simple.  You definitely don't need to be technologically savvy to install this.Being able to stream the live video to a cell phone is a great feature.  It allows the owner to be able to monitor even when away from the home computer.  For a business owner or someone trying to monitor someting happening at their home, this is priceless technology.It is great that you can shut down the PC and still record video.  The camera will store approximately 2 weeks of footage on its internal memory.  This means you can go on vacation and, if necessary, view what happened while you were gone when you return home (or watch while you're gone if you leave your computer on).ConsMy house has two outdoor outlets.  The one in the back has the filter to my fish pond plugged into it.  The camera requires an outlet where it is the only thing plugged in.  I can't unplug the fish pond filter or my fish will die.  The outlet in the front of my house faces south and is in the direct sun.  There is nothing else plugged in there, so the dedicated outlet part is fine, but Logitech recommends not using an outlet in direct sun.  So, essentially, both my outlets were unusable.  I eventually had to run a long cord from the front to the back to plug in the fish pond and use the back outlet.  I had wanted to monitor the front of my house, but since that outlet was out and the camera has to be close to the plug, I was stuck using it in the back of the house.If you want to monitor your video feed from a remote computer, you have to pay $80 a year for Commander.  This is a big con for me and a lot of other people.  I'd like to be able to monitor from other places, but the only way to do it is through my phone which eats up data time for people not on an unlimited data plan.  But, I'm not about to start paying $80 a year for it.I have two cameras installed and can't find a way to view both feeds at the same time using the software.  I'm not sure if this is just because I can't figure it out or because the software doesn't allow it.I had issues finding a location for the Home Plug.  It has to plug directly into the wall near your computer.  I have a zillion things plugged into all the outlets near my computer.  It can't go into a surge protector either.  So, I was left, again, running additional cords from outlets farther away to plug other things into to free up an outlet.  I don't like that at all.So, while the camera has a lot of good features and places where it excels, there is also a lot of room for improvement.  My biggest issues were really with the power supplies and all the rules around where they could and could not be plugged in.  Most people don't have an infinite number of outlets (especially outside) that can meet all the criteria necessary to use this camera.", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Change Of Heart!", "Author": "V.

I just had to write a review because it is not fair to those who don't know any better go through the pain and misery that I went through with this camera. I have familiarity with security cameras I have both the Panasonic BB-HCM371A Outdoor Wireless Network Camera, and Sharx Security SCNC3605 Wireless Weatherproof Outdoor MPEG4 IP Network Camera with Infrared Night Vision and built in DVR. Both in my opinion are very good line of cameras. Only cons are that the Panasonic worthless in low or no lighting just terrible plain and simple. As for the Sharx its a beast only problem is setting up remote access is a nightmare very very difficulty especially if you already have multiple devices that have remote access as I do lots of conflict. Back to the Logitech at first glance you think wow brand name they make great keyboards mouse tv remotes ext. Can't go wrong. That's where I was mistaken setting up the camera was simple but i failed to run a motion detection test on it before I mounted the thing. Boy was it horrible, the memory card was in the device but this camera failed to pick up any motion until i stood  completely still in front of the thing for ten sec then it recorded wow not good! I tired changing the motion detection threshold sensitivity there wasn't even a setting for that!  Furthermore it took multiple tries to connect to the camera from the computer I'm like why is this thing loading for five minutes looking for the ip camera. Next I figured it was an update issue this thing would never even update the device, and on my third try the camera went totally unresponsive for three hours. After that experience I have a lot respect for the job Panasonic did on their line even though I have to keep my home lights on at night Sharx too very much respect.

I spent $1K to have an electrician install the system.  You're going to need one to come run an outlet to wherever you're going to mount the camera.  I had them mounted under overhangs (Which is also the recommended installation location because, although it's an outdoor camera, they don't want direct sunlight hitting the camera.) of the roof. The electricians went up to the attic and wired additional outlets close enough to plug in the camera.  The convenience of using home electrical for your networking sounds good in theory but not so great in real life.  Unless your house is perfectly wired or very small or both, this is a poor solution because if you can't get good signal strength from the camera to the receiver your live videos will be VERY choppy at best and NO video at worst.  Appliances and a host of other things that can and will cause interference that will further degrade your signal strength.  Google \"electrical noise\".Even though I have it mounted as recommended, I've already had 1 camera stop working that needed to be replaced.  I've had to climb up to the attic a few times to reset the cameras because it won't connect.  Sometimes it's because it needed a hard reboot to connect, and others, it's because of a power outage and one or a few of the cameras were trying to connect to one of the other cameras because it thinks that one is the receiver. <--atleast that's what I read.I've also had to climb up a 2 story ladder a few times to replace the microSD cards because they've gone bad.  I guess all the writing and overwriting chews through the generic 2 GB cards they provided.  If you still decide to get this system even after reading my review, do yourself a favor and get the largest reliable microSD card and install it so it doesn't go bad as quick because it's not cycling/rewriting through the memory cards as much.  It might save your life, as a fall from 2 stories up carrying a drill and replacing a memory card the size of a fingernail isn't fun, especially if you're not a fan of heights.On the plus side, the RECORDED video quality (color and clarity) is relatively good compared to other cameras.  The ability to view online without knowing anything about computer networking is a plus also.  I just would never get a powerline system line this again as it's too unreliable.  I bought the Foscam Wireless PTZ ones for the inside of my house and like those much better.  The quality of the video isn't 720P, but it's alot more reliable...and the ability to pan is nice.

If i was away, and had enough cell phone service, i would recieve an email, be able to watch my things being stolen, and possibly be able to call the police but if they got away, that'd be all she wrote.  There may be a way to resolve this but I havn't figured it out yet.Solid camera, watches my apartment faithfully, good picture and great nightvision for my size apartment.  Wish it was plug in and play like advertised, need to figure out the video storage issue.  I plan on adding more camera's onto the system so obviously i like it enough to drop more money into it.

If you are going to have more than one camera I would look into a more reliable system that uses cat5 home run to a DVR and then into your PC.

He called a \"professional\" in who charged him thousands of dollars for a system that was less than good. He asked me what I could do. After hours of research I decided to give the above system a try. First, I want to say that Logitech's techs are truly competent. They not only answered all my pre-sales questions, but afterward always answered the phone within 5 minutes when I had a technical question.The cameras are up and the command software installed and I am ASTOUNDED at the image quality and color faithfulness of the cameras. The software is so easy to install and is very user-friendly. The hardware couldn't be easier to set up. You simply mount the camera on the bracket that is supplied and plug in the phone cord that attaches to the 110 volt power source. The \"HomePlug\" networking uses our existing electrical wiring and outlets to transmit video around your home or in my case small business. I can't imagine any system being easier.The video quality is outstanding! The outdoor daylight image looks like a handheld video camera. Indoors is equally as impressive. It works on existing light, but even in pitch black darkness the infrared shows very acceptable quality.  I was just viewing a warehouse bay that is black and yet the infrared camera is showing the entire image field in great detail (B&W;).One of the great features of this software is that the cameras can be viewed LIVE from any computer or internet phone. The camera automatically records video when it detects motion. If you ask the system to \"alert\" you, it will send your smart phone a snapped image of what caused the camera to start recording. If your \"command center\" loaded on your computer is not up because your computer shut down, the camera still records the movement to your microSD card even when you computer is shut off. When viewing your history or archived video, you can even zoom the image in or out remotely from your computer or smart phone. It may not be the least expensive do-it-yourself system, but it is hard to imagine any system being better or EASIER.Honestly, for the first time in my life I wish I could give 10 stars....", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Poor", "Author": "Ed", "ReviewID": "RUD4F6U152LPB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Since I installed the cameras (2) one has not worked and tech support spends a lot of time with me on the phone but still not working.", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "It's a junk - not any more", "Author": "Wei Tan \"Trooper\"", "ReviewID": "R2WJ5B8U7AQ4JL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I spent so much time trying to make it work but it has been not for me.

After I posted the above negative comment a QA manager named Tom from Logitech contacted me and helped with a few more testings.

That explained why it was ok every reboot and then went dark after an hour or so. He transferred the case to a Logitech corporate staff Eric who sent me a replacement set immediately. I replaced the camera and the two internet over power line adaptors, did not even re-install the software, the camera was found by the Commander software very quickly - faster than before.

But by that time we are almost already in the house.So I added a Infrared illuminator (850nm, dont buy 940nm) This helps a great deal.3) so, really Logictech should have put in double the amount of IR leds !!!

This does happen with the IR illuminator next to the camera.THREEIt certainly does have a bad lens and a bad focus system!The resolution is greatly lost when zooming in!!  Extremely grainy- hard to focus lock. Especially if the wind is moving the feeder somewhat.I know this because I put the camera on a tri pod and used it to watch birds in the backyard.Even in best lighting conditions the video of the birds was HORRIBLE !I would gladly pay a 50% premium for high resolution and especially a better/faster lens!  f/2 or f/2.8 would be greatI suspect this is f/8 or f/10 ?

The beauty of this system is that you can set it up with advanced capabilities, with or without a computer and over the internet with alert, pan, zoom, sound, or you can simply let the cameras run independently recording motion on the removable SD chip.A real nice feature is the way the system captures motion. The camera records video a few seconds before and after it detects the motion.

Initially I bought from Costco a set of Uniden cameras but immediately realized that its software was mulfunctioning and resolutoin was too poor to be of any real use, therefore returned them. After consulted with friends, I bought a set of Logitech cameras - one 750e outdoor master, one 750n outdoor add-on, and 2 indoor 700n add-ons. Despite the 2x price tag, I was happy with my choice because of its outstanding designed-in features:a) Its unique architecture to use the same electrical power cord to transmit video signals, and display/store the video clips on a regular PC, as long as it connects to the Internet. This eliminates a seperate box that requires massive cables wired to each camera around the house, making wiring and installation so easy.b) Its crystal clear and color-rish video quality and commendable night vision feature.c) Each camera contains a standard microSD card that stores recorded video before transmits it to the PC. This allows user to expand the local storage as memory cards get cheaper and not to worry about Internet being down.d) Miniature size with a good looking design.e) Cloud based monitoring service provided by Logitech (about $70/year extra) to access video clips from anywhere around the world through Internet, right from an iPhone or Android smartphone. (Although in my view the speed to load videos are a bit slow.)Despite of these great features, I only give it a 3 star because I am disappointed by its poor reliability, even just comparing it to a mediocre electronic device. Here is what happened:A few weeks after initial installation, my outdoor 750e camera started to switch itself to night vision mode randomly during day time. I called customer service, who instructed me to do all sort of things to help them diagnose what was the problem. Remember an outdoor camera is to be installed at a place out of reach from ground. I had to schedule time with their technician, then climbed to the top of my roof multple times to push reset button, unplug memory card, reconnect cable, once at a time, in order to exhust all possibilities to prove that the unit is indeed mulfunctioning beyond repair, before a permision for a replacement unit.Not long after, one of the indoor units simply stopped recording videos. Again I had to go through the same routine to help diagnose the problems before Logitech could issue a replacement.I have now re-installed both failed units with Logitech replacements and pray I won't see more failures anytime soon, but I have a feeling I would.I am an engineer by training working in high tech industry and I understand an on-site fix is much more economical than a replacement. Also I admit that Logitech tech support people are professional and trying their best to help.

The item arrived with no software or manual. They also blacked out the product PIN number required for support from Logitech. Any ability to receive support has been voided because of this. They failed to mention any of this in their description of the item. The camera has a defect as well, changes from colror to grey and white in the middle of the day and loses ability to focus.Regarding the camera:All in all the camera seems adequate. It delivers a nice clear picture (if it's working) and picks up sound very well. I don't like that you have no ability to set the length of recording time once it has been triggered by motion. Also it has no manual record feature. It may have just been my environment here at home but the software had difficulty finding the camera initially. After plugging and unplugging and trying this and that I finally got it to work.One other area that can be improved upon is the playback feature. All recordings are displayed on a time line with tiny blue lines representing the recordings. At times it can be difficult to select the recording you want and deleting a recording is done by right clicking on the tiny line which can prove to be quite difficult as well.", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "very bad technical assitence", "Author": "Amin Makram Simaika", "ReviewID": "R2S54YTJFERCT7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "120819-000794]From the very moment I installed this very expensive night vison camera every thing work perfect but it does not save a file I called the suplier on international calls and they kept on hold and when they decided to sell them back the camera becaue there was no way to repair they hanged the telphone and I did sent them many emails and now no ansewers what should I do is there an address at Amazon that I can send back this camera ?", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unable to return, missed 30 day return by 1 day", "Author": "dfd105", "ReviewID": "R1Y8HP09D2FW4S", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had purchased to install at my parents home, since it is out of town, I was unable to return when I discovered the system was missing one of the parts that made the system work inside the house.

It took me a while to get around to installing as it looked like quite the project.  However, the directions are clear and easy to follow, and it took less than 30 minutes to set up a two camera system.  The software is simple and seems to work well.  The biggest advantage in my opinion is you can set the system up to alert you via email if movement is detected.  There is also a web page where you can sign in and view your cameras when you're away from home.  Best of all, there's an iphone app that also lets you check your cameras. Just viewing is free, if you want the deluxe versions that allow you to change camera setting remotely there is an additional fee.  Just viewing is sufficient for my needs however.One annoyance I've found so far is there are FOUR different colored very bright (some flash) LEDs on the power unit for the main camera.  It's VERY annoying and attention grabbing, and screams \"UNPLUG ME!\"  You can turn off the LEDs on the camera itself (I don't, love the deterrent) but there is no way to disable them on the power box.

Both systems are indoor/outdoor, but each comes with either an indoor or an outdoor camera. I have the outdoor unit, though I received an indoor camera as well for testing.Setup is absurdly easy. From opening the box to having a working system takes roughly 10 minutes, and installing the control software is painless and easy. Once installed and configured you can start working with the system immediately.The cameras and the software communicate via network, so plan your network topology appropriately. We discovered two important issues, though, when using wireless networking to communicate with the cameras. First, the cameras have a tendency to drop connectivity all at once, and the only recourse is to power them off and back on again. This may be a function of the router we are using, but it still is important to keep in mind. Second, we loaded the software on a laptop and used that for controlling the cameras, and that worked well until the laptop was allowed to hibernate. When it came back, communication with the cameras was lost every time and the cameras needed to be power cycled. Though communication was lost with the cameras, the cameras continued to faithfully record so it could be worse.The cameras with this system are billed as HD and live up to it. Video is clear and crisp.The night vision capabilities on the outdoor camera are outstanding. Seeing in the dark is one of this particular camera's strengths. Unfortunately, the indoor camera does not have night vision so recording down a dark hallway will give poor results. This is an unfortunate design decision and hopefully will be addressed later.The cameras are activated by motion, and the sensitivity is set via a slider in the control software. At the highest sensitivity level, the slightest movement triggers the camera and it starts recording. For an outdoor unit this is too sensitive and the camera will eat through its storage quickly. However, for indoor cameras this is a fine setting when the home is unoccupied for a time.The cameras can handle larger memory cards but ship with 2GB cards. This is sufficient for starting off but for extended use you'll want a larger memory card.Because the cameras can be monitored remotely over the internet it is interesting to \"tune in\" and see what's happening (you can even tap in through your cell phone). It is also useful to transfer the contents of the cards remotely too.The cameras do not have a battery backup system, so put them on a battery backup if possible. When the power goes out, the eyes go dim.Logitech has put together a very nice security system that sports a number of nice features. There is room for improvement and there are some flaws, but overall this is a system worth the expense.

It will capture an image and send an email alert sometimes and sometimes not. Whilst testing, I observed cars passing on the street out front... I got an email alert that captured the blurry motion blur of headlights each time. But when I asked my wife to step outside and walk around, it failed to send any alerts at all. While I was watching her, I asked her to talk in a normal voice just a few feet from the camera. I didn't hear a thing through the camera. It was disappointing to see just ghostly blurred images with jerky motion. I gotta allow only two stars for this one. It's more or less a useable surveillance camera... but just barely.
