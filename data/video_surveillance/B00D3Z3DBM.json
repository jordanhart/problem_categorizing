I saw that there was an upgrade to the firmware. I followed the instructions exactly.  Transfer two file and upload them in sequence. Halfway through the process I received an error message and basically rendered the device to a brick (as in now useless).  You would think zmodo would develop firmware that caches the firmware and calculates and compares a checksum to validate the update, ONLY THEN would the firmware be swapped in. Of course there is no documentation or knowledge base or directions/program to fix this. STAY CLEAR OF THIS PRODUCT!", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Avoid", "Author": "dude 293", "ReviewID": "R8WYCV61GPLNQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The good: the video actually worked, the picture was reasonable in the day time.The ugly: I was able see the video on my Windows laptop after getting IE to accept an unsigned component.  From the manual: \"Open Internet Explorer, enter the IE Tools menu and go to Tools  -->Internet Options  --->SecuritySettings ---->Custom Level. Find the item titled \u201cDownload unsigned ActiveX Controls\u201d and change it to\u201cPrompt.\u201d Also change \u201cInitialize and script ActiveX controls not marked as safe for scripting\u201d to\u201cPrompt\u201d (As Figure1).\"  It is saying, go ahead, open up IE even more to web-related viruses.  Not acceptable for a mass market product.The bad: the software.  On android, it just crashes.  On Windows, besides the issue above, the IE activeX controls look like they were written by a high school intern.  I could live with that if it actually worked.  I could not get email notifications or any kind of motion detection to work which I cared about most, but everything else was glitchy at best.  The online manuals are sorely lacking, giving me a sentence or two for some of the controls.
