As a novice in installing security cameras it took a about an hour to get it to work.  It works very well and definitely recommend to all who want a security camera, snapshot, or video camera for day and night vision.  It works well to view anything you want in your house or anywhere indoors or viewing out a window or door.  The only thing I really had a problem with is understanding the technical terms like FTP and DDNS.  The manual on the CD that was provided takes you step by step to install the camera.  The price is very reasonable compared to other wireless cameras.  Very pleased with the purchase.  Would buy again.", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's not perfect but considering the cost this is a decent camera.", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R1RN00IMEHYT3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "These are my initial thoughts after using the camera for a few days. I'll update this review if things change. This is my first IP camera.* Initial setup was fairly easy, although the instructions were junk. What you need to do: (1) plug camera into an ethernet port on your router / network switch. (2) plug camera into power (3) run the little initialization utility from Avacom's website from a computer on your network: www.avacomtech.com/support.html  (4) click \"search\" and the camera should show up in the list (5) select the camera from the list, enter the IP address you want it to use (or check 'set IP automatically' for DHCP) and then click \"update\"* After initial setup is done and the camera reboots, you can now use a browser on your network to view the camera directly. From there you can access additional settings like Network / Wireless, Alarm, Email (it can email you a series of screenshots on an alarm), Security / Users, and a bunch of other stuff.*  The wireless connection is a little flakey. It sometimes takes 10-15min before the camera connects itself to my wireless network. It will also sometimes disconnect itself for a while and come back later. Also, the wireless range is not very good and there is no strength indicator in the camera's interface. I have a very good to excellent signal with my laptop and phone in the same areas. One other thing with the wireless that's bothering me is that since I've installed 2 of these cameras a few days ago, my wireless signal has gone completely down twice and I needed to reboot my router to get it back. I'm not sure if (or how?) it's the cameras' fault yet but it has never done that before.* The pan and tilt feature work quite well. The motors are nice and quiet, although you can still hear them working.* The image quality is fairly good, again for the price. I had to adjust the focus on both of the cameras by turning the ring around the lens back and forth until it looked decent. You're not going to be able to make out people's faces from more than about 7-10ft away. Colors are acceptable.* I wanted to use one of the cameras to monitor my driveway and front porch by pointing it out a front window. This setup works fine in the daylight but once it gets dark, the IR LEDs automatically turn on and all I get is a bright reflection off of the glass. I haven't figured out a way to manually disable the IR yet, if that's possible. I may have to resort to electrical tape to cover them.* The cameras get a little warm to the touch after being plugged in a while. Nothing too bad but it would indicate to me that these probably won't last the longest. I may add some ventilation holes in the base to help. Writing this review got me curious so I just plugged it into my kill-a-watt and found that it uses about 2w of electricity, not too bad.", "Date": "July 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice camera.", "Author": "Ethan Shepherd", "ReviewID": "R2ZCBDKL346JRX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this camera as a replacement for one of a different brand that I couldn't get to work on my home network. This one worked right out of the box: just plugged it into my router where it was given an IP address, and then go to that address for the camera's interface. All the options are configured from there: remote access, alerts, etc., all pretty simple. Picture quality is pretty good (640x480), night vision works very well, haven't tried the audio. The 360 degree range means the one camera in my front window can view the whole front yard as well as pan around to the interior. Great camera for the price, I'll be getting another. Have to mention that the email support guy at Avacom was very helpful and knew what he was talking about, which was a nice surprise.", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Avacom M1060W well worth the price", "Author": "RAMON C BICKNELL", "ReviewID": "RC8MYWG6VFUKJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received the new Avacom M1060W yesterday.

Build quality is superb, video quality is perfect, and audio quality is great.This camera has all features you find in other models with a better price.Further, and this part is important, the manufacturer/seller is super fast and helpful with support. I emailed last night around 11 pm with a question regarding compatibility of this model with opensource ispy.  Within minutes I received a response telling me they will download ispy and get it to work.

I had some problems getting my network to work with my cable router.  The customer service was amazing!  They helped me walk through every step of the process and answered any other questions I had.  They also were able to offer some suggestions on phone apps that I could get to control over my cell phone.  I had a problem with the microphone but, I think that is my wi-fi issues or because I have an older model cell phone.  First review ever on Amazon and had to share my experience.
