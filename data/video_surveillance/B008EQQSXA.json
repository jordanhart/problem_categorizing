It can also be used to show video from other sources in your car but it does not have sound output.  The remote control allows you to switch between two video sources.  This is a nice looking screen and it offers to you multiple methods of mounting it and the mounting hardware is supplied.You may want to consider having this monitor professionally installed as there is some wiring to be done and any time you are wiring items into your car you must be careful.  This is even a recommendation from the supplier so please consider it if you are not skilled at doing such work yourself.I had mine wired to a Taotronics TT-CC17 backup license plate camera which also came with the appropriate wiring harness. I put together a video of the unit and its accessories for your information.What's in the box?* The screen itself* A plastic mounting snap in frame for the monitor* A wiring harness with a fused power line and two video plugs ready to connect to a backup camera and another possible video input source. The harness is 6 feet long.* An instruction manual* A remote control* A metal mounting stand for mounting the screen to make it adjustable in the angle of the monitor viewing for the driver.* A double-sided adhesive mounting pad to mount the stand if you do not want to drill any holes.This is a nicely packaged monitor and it comes with all of the accessories you need for a professional installation.  I am using it for a backup camera like I said but it can also be used to show videos in your vehicle.  I rated it as a 5 star item.I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Quality LCD Widescreen", "Author": "DubaluBubaluGubalu", "ReviewID": "R1SAS2WOS2VZHM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Definitely recommend this for anyone interested in installing their own rear backup camera system.  As mentioned in title above the quality is absolutely clear as is, not high definition but still as good. Very happy with it. I bought this as my first install rear backup camera system.

It is not high definition but is detailed enough to work as an excellent backup LCD  screen. The monitor automatically switch to the backup camera when it sense you shifted to reverse..Specs:- 7\" screen size- 16:9 aspect- NTSC / PAL- 12V, 8W- 2 video inputsThe LCD monitor came with a remote control.  You can easily switch with the remote from the backup camera mode (V2) to what you installed on V2, whether it is a DVD player or a game console. Just be aware that the LCD screen don't have any speakers built-in so you would need to connect the audio to your car stereo or a separate speaker.  Aside from the remote, the LCD screen has physical buttons to control power, video inputs, and menu for adjusting screen brightness, etc.The screen is intended to be hard wired to work with your backup camera.  It is not for a quick snap installation, a professional like an automotive radio installer is recommended. Of course you can do a DIY if you are pretty handy with these things.My setup is paired with a TT-CC17 camera.  I can see the wide angle image, from left to right and how close the rear bumper is from an object with the LCD screen.  The guide area lines on the lower part of the screen with the red line telling you are almost just a foot away from bumping to an object.  The green lines are about three to five away approximately.  The guide lines will not appear when you are on V1.Sample item provided by the distributor for evaluation review.", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Gets the job done!", "Author": "Stillie", "ReviewID": "R2T487KL2K6XY5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Look folks, it's a 7\" monitor that you're likely installing to entertain your children.

Bought this along with the Tao Tronics CC17 camera.Got it installed in Best Buy for $100 (well worth the money).You can either set it up to be on all the time or turn on only when you switch the gear to Reverse (While not in reverse, the display powers off, which is a nice feature).  It has two video inputs, apparently 2nd input could be connected to a DVD player or a second video camera.I have a Tesla Model S and a Nissan Leaf.  The camera in Tesla is of course top notch, with great day time picture quality.  Leaf is a bit mediocre.  But the night vision in Tao tronics camera is great compared to both my other cars.  But daylight camera quality is so so.. not sure if it is the display or the camera, but the colors seem to be off a bit.
