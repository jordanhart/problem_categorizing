The night vision is surprisingly good too. There are a variety of ways to set it for my surveillance needs and the manual gives examples of how most people would best use it. I've only had it in use about a month so we'll see if it lasts, but no problems yet.", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Robert B Gamble", "ReviewID": "R34BRAMQQY2ZP6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own 7 other cameras just like this one and they cost about a hundred dollars more.....they were not worth the difference.

Forget getting anywhere near 30 ft or more. Returning mine. Also had problem with motion detection part of software... just doesn't work, everything is greyed out like it's not fully done yet.
