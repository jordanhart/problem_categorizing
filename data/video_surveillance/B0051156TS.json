In fact, it is the same resolution as every other monitor on Amazon, 320x248 (Not to mention the EXACT SAME PRODUCT. I am not kidding. The plastic shell, the buttons, the stand, the plugs, it is 110% the same thing as every other Amazon 3.5\" monitor from the same Chinese manufacturer). This is ONE FOURTH of the the promised pixel count. It is nowhere near the resolution that it very clearly says in the specs. The voltage and amp requirements are also unclear, even when no adapter is provided. This means you basically have to roll the dice and connect it to a random power line (which you have do splice wires for) and hope the damn thing doesn't explode while you're doing it.Product is below-average, specs are a lie, wiring is a pain, price is higher than other apparently exact same low resolution models on Amazon. Do not buy this specific product from this specific manufacturer, you can find the exact same thing on Amazon for $8 cheaper (e.g. 3.5 Inch TFT LCD Monitor for Car / Automobile.I am extremely disappointed in these dime a dozen manufacturers who do not bother to write accurate specs and sell cheap knock-off goods and then steal cheap knock-off copy-and-paste descriptions.", "Date": "September 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Misleading description, There is no audio but dual video.", "Author": "dincon2000", "ReviewID": "R24CRO9T39TBJR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The title says AV RCA video sound input and the picture shows standard Audio, Video and Power conncections. There are no speakers and the Audio (white) jack is actually a second video input.  Other than that it is a decent little screen.  I paid a little more than similar products on Amazon because it had the audio.  My first clue was that there was no volume adjustment. Then I tested, using my DVD player, to make sure.  Picture was great but no sound. Other units only have the video and power so I wondered \"What is the white jack for?\" The description talks about auto switching between V1 and V2 with a special note about how to hook the power up. So, I put the DVR video output to the white jack.  Yep, nice picture. Based on the power hookup description I'll guess that V1 is yellow and V2 is white.  When V2 is powered up, then the unit automatically switches to V2.  I didn't test that though. There are no brightness or contrast adjustments nor is there an on-off switch. I give it a 2 star for what it is compared to what is described. If the description was correct, I'd probably give it a 4 star since it doesn't have any video adjustment although they don't claim there is so maybe even a 5. I'm trying to replace a little 2 inch unit that has brigthness, volume, a little speaker and an on-off switch.Oh, there are no instructions either.

First off!! This monitor is made for your car as a back up safety monitor. There is no speaker or sound on this monitor, so dont expect any! Next! There is no power supply included with this, as the power comes from your 12 volt DC car electrical system! Next!

It is a compact monitor, very practical to use in the car.3. It automatically switches between two cameras. It seems like 'white' input is intended for rear view camera, and yellow for front view camera. By default, the monitor displays 'yellow' input signal, however, when you shift rear gear (which should turn on the rear view camera), the monitor receives 'white' input signal and displays rear camera video. Shifting back from rear gear turns off the rear view camera and since there is no 'white' signal, the monitor switches back to 'yellow' (front) camera.4. Could run on 9V battery (this is how I tested it since it came with no power supply).5. The menu has options for brightness, contrast, color adjustment, rotation...6.
