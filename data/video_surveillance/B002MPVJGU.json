Defender doesn't have the microphone come with it so I ordered this mic and it works fine. I can hear people talking across the street from my house. I can hear cars driving by and people stop at or near my house. Great little microphone and I would recommend it for anyone to use it at home.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "very sensitive", "Author": "Zborn", "ReviewID": "R2MX9KVUEWCVSE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This microphone works well, and is capable of hearing a wide range.  It seems to be specifically designed in the range of the human voice.  It is defiantly not high fidelity or for recording complex ranges of audio like music or other sounds with verity, although if your neighbor is playing some music it might pick it up.  The cable run is long but be prepared with enough plugs if you use a power-strip like I do.  As advertised, it is not made for outdoors.  I have it mounted under the eve of the house outside and it so far has been working perfectly.  It would be nice to have something available with more directional properties.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great range", "Author": "Jean-Pierre Giagnoli", "ReviewID": "R3DICE7XNNGYMX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great range and even great sound.

Haynes", "ReviewID": "REUDNKXYAOUQB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This microphone works well.  You can hear someone outside live provided you have your monitor connected for sound, hear sound in playback, or over the internet.I used a 4-way splitter that I had left over from the original camera installation instead of the supplied plug and added it to my camera system power supply to eliminate an extra thing to plug. I wish I had installed a microphone when I installed the cameras so that I could have run all the cable at the same time.  Realized it's nice to have a microphone at the front door.", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very sensitive", "Author": "No Name", "ReviewID": "R1HNM0FGW618PV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is way to sensitive to sound, but can heat people talking from a distance.

Enough wire to place the mic in the best location. Build quality appears good. Sound quality was not so good. I tested with my wife using the phone app from long distance. Even knowing her voice and what she was about to say, it was difficult understand her when see was just 10 ft from the mic. It can pick up noise from other rooms, but not sure how useful those sounds would be if indistinguishable. Maybe if needed the police could enhance the sound to better understand, but the quality too very low for most any use for me. I am keeping it, since it may be useful under the right conditions.", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "xenon hid", "ReviewID": "R1SL1WUWOBDKZL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "extremely nice very good quality its worth every penny like it very much highly recommended buy buy buy buy buy", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "BETTER MIKE THAN WHAT WE HAD", "Author": "T.
