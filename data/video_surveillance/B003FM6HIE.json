The shipping was speedy!  2. For what you get, the price just cannot be matched elsewhere!  3.  The products(dummy cameras) were packaged nicely and looked exactly as advertised! This is a perfect setup if you are looking to install a dummy monitoring system.  The cameras look exactly like a similar real set w/DVR that I saw for about $500.00.  The IR style is an added feature as well.  They are very easy to install and pretty stable and sturdy once you fix them to the mounting and angles that you want.  Additionally, the fact that they dont have blinking lights is a great bonus because if you are going to use a set of four, who wants to keep climbling ladders and changing batteries!  Finally, I liked the wires that came with the cameras.  They are sticking out the back so all you have to do is place the other end underneath the mounting kit for added realism!  Basically, These cameras are actually are shells of the \"real\" product only they have been disabled from operational use.  You will also note that they throw in a bunch of warning stickers as well which cost about $10.00 if purchased on their own!!!", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Coulda fooled me!", "Author": "Michael D.

The cameras install easily with 3 provided, plated screws and plastic plaster sleeves if used indoors in sheet rock. Camera can be set at any angle. They look and feel real.

I had seen other fake cameras for ~$10/each so I thought 4 fake cameras for $30 was a good deal.I received the items quickly enough and they were packaged well in individual boxes; no damage.Issues:1. the item description says \"VideoSecu 4 Dummy Imitation Security Camera with Flashing Light LED Cost-effective Security CCTV Simulated Dome Camera DMY03D4 WE5\".  These fake cameras sold by  Qiang Zhao are NOT by VideoSecu (a legitimate video security/surveillance company).  in fact, if you look up the model # DMY03D4 on [...], no results are found2. the cameras i received had two plastic screws holes on the sides that makes them look OBVIOUSLY fake.  from the street, a anyone (including a thief) might think these are real, but come any closer it is obvious that they are fake.luckily the order was fulfilled by amazon so I was able to return it without issue. BUYER BEWARE!!!NOTE: real cameras do NOT have blinking red lights, so if you do buy these, please do not put the batteries in.  you may as well put a neon sign on your house saying \"I am too cheap for real security.\"  to a thief this means that the ADT security/alarm monitoring sign you have in front of your house is probably fake too.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best dummy camera", "Author": "Best Product", "ReviewID": "R24Y3FUENE3XHY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Product has been working very good so far.

NGUYEN \"The truth is temporarily painful\"", "ReviewID": "R2V9USQKU520W6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this fake dummy camera set based on the 5 star reviews I read here.  Well, I was kinda disappointed when I actually had them in hand.  First and foremost these are really, really cheap looking.  Sure, they're plastic and everything but when you remove the cover to install the batteries you'll know what I mean.  Poor molding manufacturing shows through out.  The camera or rather fake LED bulb resembling the lens can't be tilted up or down without hitting the battery compartment.  Make sure you know which direction and angle you want the fake lens to aim at and mark the holes (the mounting holes are not indicative of any direction).Last but not least is the battery placement itself. To replace the batteries you have to remove the base instead of just the cover.  This is cumbersome and could have been reversed so that when you remove the cover, you have access to the battery box without having to also the base also.  Granted if you installed it correctly, you can twist the base off of the two retaining screws but I like mine to be secure so that means having to loosen the screws.  So yes, to replace the batteries you will have to loosen the mounting screws holding the base in after you have removed the cover.  I am not sure yet how long the 2 AA batteries will last but I am hoping at least 6 months.  The stickers included are just OK and seem generic and quite cheesy.  Personally, I would rather not use the stickers because it might equate to cheesy = fake camera.", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very convincing and easy to put up", "Author": "Casey Finigan", "ReviewID": "R2HCLAM91UH7FA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Easy to install.
