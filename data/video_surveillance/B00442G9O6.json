{"Reviews": [{"Title": "They do what they claim, but beware the hidden gotcha", "Author": "Mac Coder", "ReviewID": "R2K0CCVMYGDPIE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These are perfectly competent video baluns, and honestly described in the product description.However, all purchasers of such items should be aware that while such inexpensive passive baluns will provide the desired impedance matching and common-mode rejection, they do NOT provide any sort of isolation at all -- they are wired in an autotransformer configuration.As a result, they provide ZERO protection for the video ports on your camera/DVR/whatever.You can see this yourself without gutting one by simply using an ohm-meter to measure the resistance from the balanced line terminals to the BNC terminal -- you will discover that one of the BL terminals is directly connected to one of the BNC terminals, and the other has a very low resistance between it and the other BNC terminal.Or you can go to the Wikipedia article for BALUN and see a schematic of a typical balun, right under the subtitle: \"Types of balun\"If you are running video over twisted pair, I sincerely recommend using some sort of grounded lightning/surge protection device between the BALUN and your more expensive widgets, like a DVR. The newer, inexpensive security DVRs do not seem to have much in the way of internal protection on them, and a nearby lightning strike or whatnot can easily generate voltages on the twisted pair that will fry an input port. Cameras seem to be more durable.", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Cheap but work", "Author": "SamIAm \"JustMe\"", "ReviewID": "R35CXTRGAPXB6W", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Items work as promised.  However they are cheap.  The spring on the locking ring is weak and the fitting is loose.  If you wiggle or bump them the video goes OUT or becomes noisy.  This is a pain if you put the balun into the camera housing and later have to disassemble the camera again to wiggle the balun.  If I had to do over, I would buy better quality baluns.  The size is good and the fact that there isn't a cable hanging of them is also a plus to me.  However they do work as long as you dont touch or wiggle them.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Must have", "Author": "Cuffy", "ReviewID": "R35ZA5MVPP3GBM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These passive BNC Video Baluns sure make wiring video systems super-simple and fast!  Until I got a mail-order video surveillance system I had no familiarity with this equipment; I'm a senior citizen DIY'er experienced with auto and home wiring, and bygone days of entertainment system wiring.  Video wire is close to hair-thin (think phone wires), so having these Baluns with the screw-clamp insertion points for the wire makes putting them on easy, even with time-desensitized fingers!  :-)  I ordered 'just enough' but will be ordering more for 'supply' and further wiring additions.

Beware Center Pin to Negative, and know what you really expect!", "Author": "Jonathan Wagner", "ReviewID": "R30CID4V4MMHX1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This last purchase we had 7 bad ones out of 5 sets of these (worst EVER). Not sure they are all the same manufacturer as there were light gray, dark gray, and black ones. The black ones seem to be the worst as many you could tell the pin wasn't all the way in and testing continuity with a multi-meter showed no connection to the positive terminal or the negative for that matter (we had two wired to negative from center pin so just switching the wires around fixes that). I've used these on several jobs regardless as you just can't beat the price point. Passive balun's are exactly that, they are not going to protect you from lightning or boost signal or fix interference. So know what your buying and plan around it. I also will let you know the really light gray ones do have a tendency to burn out and you can physically see rippling on the surface where it did so (only had about 4 of these that didn't happen right away). This may have been fixed as within the last 5 months or so I haven't had any issues like that and have installed well over 300 of these within the last few years. The former statements of weak connection spring was indeed the case about a year ago but now I often see the reverse where it's hard as hell to get them to lock in.", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Standard Video Balun", "Author": "Kris C", "ReviewID": "R2W126MZMIMSV7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just your standard BNC Balun, works like they all do.
