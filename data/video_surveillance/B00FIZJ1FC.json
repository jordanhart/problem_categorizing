{"Reviews": [{"Title": "OK cam but software and support sucks", "Author": "I. Knelev", "ReviewID": "R3A5IGC2M520IM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Camera itself seems to be OK and producing good quality picture day and night. Response rate is pretty good even over WiFi Software - PIXOViewer is really user unfriendly and buggy. First of all I could not get it installed on my Win 8 PC unless I disable all  security warnings. But even after I was able to install it will only run if I change properties to \"Run as Administrator\". Camera set up instructions are very primitive and it took me sometime to figure out how to set it up ( and I am very computer savvy). Another thing, PIXOViewer is not compatible with some Android tablets. I have Nook HD+ with pretty much stock Android 4.2 but was not able to install PIXOViewer. I end up installing third party app (IP Cam Viewer) which works OK -  but there are no sound in or out. Even with PixoViewer sound is very bad. One more thing - PTZ controls do not work at all - none. There is no manual included with camera - so you on your own to figure out what is what.After using it for sometime - more grief:Accessing the camera from more than one device(phone and PC) at the same time will cause picture distortion and app crashCamera needs rebooting every other day. It becomes unreachable for no apparent reason and won't work until restarted.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic price -works perfectly, the best monitor on the market", "Author": "Erica Dixon", "ReviewID": "RR3ZRB06I3ZW2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great baby monitor, I did have a technical issue, but request for help answered quickly and correctly very pleased with purchase.
