I did not allow time to wrestle with the cable mess, so it really put me behind schedule about a half day. After some serious frustration I finally sat down and untangled the mess and re-rolled the wire up on some foam rubber. Then it's ok. Frankly I would have paid double not to have had to deal with this mess. I did not see any other reviews about this particular aspect of these cables and maybe there's some 'trick' to dealing with them, but I didn't see any option other than untangling them and rolling them back up on a makeshift spool so that as I'm fishing the cable through the attic it would unroll without tangling.", "Date": "September 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Too light weight for my application", "Author": "Todd Logan", "ReviewID": "RKIOUJON218HB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought a couple of these as the cables that came with my FirstAlert security system were 60' and I needed a few longer runs.
