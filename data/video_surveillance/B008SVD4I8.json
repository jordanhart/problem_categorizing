{"Reviews": [{"Title": "DVR/cameras fine, but MyDVR s/w awful!!", "Author": "PAL", "ReviewID": "R2062KVM6HFN8H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my 5th security DVR.  The first two were Lorex capture cards - very basic, very cheap, but worked fine.  The third was a Q-See DVR - was working ok, then night vision on the cameras started going out one by one, then DVR h/d crashed.  4th was a Swann 2600.  User interface pretty archaic - image quality when viewing remotely not good at all.  So I shelled out big bucks (at least I think so) for the D1 4000.  The image quality is much better than my previous ones and the cameras seem pretty good - especially night vision.  DVR user interface is nice and more up-to-date than the 2600 and I was able to set up my network settings for remote viewing very quickly and easily.  I can view cameras fine on my Android phone and iPad, although I can only see 4 of my 8 cameras at a time with the Swann Android app, so I use IP Cam Viewer Basic, but it's not in constant real time like the Swann app.But the issue that's driving me crazy is that the MyDVR remote viewing software that it comes with is absolutely terrible!  It's worse than all the others I've used - even the Swann Netviewer s/w that came with their 2600 DVR was much better than this!  For one, the version on the disk didn't work at all - vers 1.0.1.5.  Swann support sent me a link to vers 1.0.1.21 which at least works.  But you can't resize the screen to a smaller window, it's either full screen or nothing.  So I can't shrink it and move it to the corner of my 24\" monitor and continue working on other things while at work.  If I totally minimize it and try to open it back up, none of the cameras appear and I have to shut it down and log back in.  It doesn't save the login field info, so I have to type everything each time.  I can't remotely playback any footage recorded on my DVR and trying to manage DVR settings remotely is pretty much impossible.  And there's not the option to choose NO-IP as my DDNS service as there was on the 2600 DVR, although it's not really necessary.I called Swann support (very short wait, although e-mails go unanswered) and asked if there was some other s/w that worked with this DVR and they said no.  This is probably going to be a deal breaker for me and I'll end up returning it if I can't figure out another solution to have the features I need.Oh, I did not buy this DVR through Amazon.com, but thought a review would be helpful.", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Buggy, insecure.", "Author": "Pursual", "ReviewID": "R12JU41B9LXXWN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This unit if riddled with bugs. None of the different client softwares seem to be certain what your current configuration is, so you have to configure from within the DVR itself. The DVR often mails out blank jpeg files (files containing 0 data) instead of the image captured. The camera cables cannot be used at anywhere near their full length without introducing a lot of distortion to the image, which in turn sends the motion detection haywire.There are also tons of pages all over the internet about hackers who have discovered that this system is completely hackable. This also means that if you entered your gmail password into the smtp setup, it can easily be stolen. [...]Swann has yet to address any of these concerns.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not yet ready", "Author": "KIT", "ReviewID": "R1S59DCXJU1PHB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Pros: D1 recording on all 8 channel, real time and playback. HDMI connectionCons: Remote administration is limited and buggy, remote viewing using iPhone app IP Cam Viewer locked up the DVR. Loud fan. Must use Swannviewer app. Price for a buggy unit.This product is new, however there are too many bugs in the firmware. Especially if you are doing things remotely. Can't add users remotely, you need to be in front of the DVR to use the full functions. You can't just stick it in the closet and access remotely to administer.  DVR can lock up and the only way to get back is to turn it off and on. Called tech support, and they told me to do this. I tried changing D1 recording to CIF remotely, after doing so I get an \"error retrieving data\" message when going to another setting menu. Have to turn off and on. There is no new firmware at this time. 1TB Hard drive came with Realloacted Sector Count value of 140 (from SMART). Hard drive about to go bad soon. Did not try their cameras. Using my own cameras. Product returned, too many problems.I did not buy it from Amazon.", "Date": "August 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Performs better than average", "Author": "BrianL", "ReviewID": "RZYQLRTPE5XD4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the money a good system.
