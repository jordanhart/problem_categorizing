The Esky c5900 meets all my needs. It is very simple to set up. The instructions are very clear. I am going to buy 4 more of these as soon as i am done with this review.

I spent to much time because of my pc but at the ends camera worked perfectly.It would be great if this system had zoom function but because of the price I know this is impossible he he.I recommend this product to people who needs to take care about home or office, and wants to access from everywhere.", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Move along, nothing to see here", "Author": "J.E.", "ReviewID": "R2KNWTQOSZO6QU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this cam thinking it looked enough like an FI8918w. It works fine through IE ActiveX, but doesn't stream audio to iOS/Android, making it useless as a baby monitor. This wasn't worth the headache, and I'm an IT pro.Update: after weeks of trying to work this thing and contacting support only to be ignored, I've concluded that this product has no way to stream audio to iOS or Android. No one but other disgruntled users has answered any of my forum postings either. I purchased an actual Foscam camera and it's made all the difference in the world. the FI8910w I purchased as a replacement streams audio and video to my portable devices without a hitch to every device I've set it up on. Esky is a big no-no.", "Date": "June 29, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$102.99", "Features": "H.264 IP Camera,Local Micro SD card storage\nPan/Tilt remote control ,2-way audio,night vision\nInternet WiFi Wireless/Wired\nIR cut,Support Mac/Windows/Linux\nBuild-in DVR ,Motion triggered", "Name": "Esky C5900 H.264 Wireless DDNS WiFI IR-cut IP Camera Monitor Pan/Tilt PTZ 2-ways Audio LED night vision CCTV security monitor built-in microphone and speaker Mobile (iPhone Android Symbian OS Windows Phone7) Viewing Support Micro SD Card Slot Store Video", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41dCyUKN15L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006W4AL3Y"}}
