{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera for the price!", "Author": "Christopher", "ReviewID": "R2LK009YNOT6TM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This little thing is a good buy.  Simple easy to use camera.  The wireless is very user friendly and it truly compliments my DVR system.  However, if you wish to try and record all four channels at once, that will not happen.  Remember that you can switch between 4 cameras on one wireless receiver (provided you have four Security Man wireless cameras) but you will not be able to record all four channels from the one receiver at the same time.  There is only one output for recording.  You will need to purchase an additional set utilizing the other channels.The range is very good for my needs.  I have a 1600 sq ft home.  The camera is outside on my patio and the receiver with the DVR is upstairs.  There are walls and about a 30 foot distance between the camera and receiver.  Picture is very nice and the Night Vision is very good.  4 stars only because the picture could always use a little more improvement on these types of cameras.  But make no mistake, this is a great buy for simple needs!", "Date": "April 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B007ROSR6G"}}
