It's no use to me, so I have to return this product.

Camera is very small and can be mounted and positioned any way you like, the microphone is terrible compared to some other inline microphones I've purchased. also this camera does not have the IR cut filter, so greens and blacks look purple in the daytime.I used this camera in my infant son's room, while the quality is a reflection of the price, I'm still ok with it.
