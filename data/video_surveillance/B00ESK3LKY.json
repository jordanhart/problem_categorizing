This Hikvision is noticeable yet discreet at the same time.  IE it's not this giant security wart lump on your house.  You'll see a red LED if you are looking closely in the daytime.*  NICE, Fairly wideangle picture.  (2.8 mm lens)*  It's 3MP for $199.00*  I didn't have to do any focusing.  I just had to adjust the tilt on the camera, that's it.*  Performs reasonably well in low light and gives a basic black and white picture with the IR in NO light.*  You can run it one notch down (1080p) at 30 frames per second.  (At it's top resolution it runs at 15 fps.)*  Overall build quality seems pretty good.CONS:  Q-SEE OWNERS BEWARE:  This camera will * NOT * work with my recent build (Sept 30th, 2013) Q-SEE 816  8 channel security NVR (Network Video Recorder).  Specifically, you can do all kinds of things to spoon feed the Q-SEE the network info (DHCP, no-DHCP but setting the exact subnet and port for the Q-SEE, etc.  -- NO GO).  Q-SEE customer support has confirmed this.  Hikvision is not specifed on their approved / supported manufactures list and will not work \"generically\" using the Q-SEE's \"ONVIF\" , \"general\" or \"Private\" setting.*  Setup can be a bit involved.  The manual could be a lot better.  Sometimes I couldn't tell if they were talking anecdotally / by example or literally (i.e. DO THIS) . It's shipped with a static IP.  Out of the box, it does not default to DHCP network IP address leasing awareness as enabled.  You have to turn that on.  You have to use a utility (provided on Disk by Hikvision) to discover the camera on your network and then login as admin to program it so it can be found on your own subnet.*  The screws for the housing are easy to lose and have some kind of 6 point star pattern (torx?) that is not something you can commonly find.  Don't lose them - it's easy to do.*  I found that when using Internet Explorer version 11 (on Windows 7 Professional), that I had to set it to \"Compatibility Mode\" to get the Hikvision admin software to work correctly.  I found that if I didn't do that, the active-x control that loads the video in IE would not load properly and also my range of settings was decreased or flat out not listed /missing.Some perspective on my usage scenario:  I have a pair of LED Porch lights (one on either side of my house's side door).  These are augmented by (much higher up on house) a pair of LED PAR38  90Watt equivalent output lights.  All of those lights have motion triggers.After dark, when either of those light banks go on - I get good color, exposure, detail.  If there's no cars or human activity triggering the light after 10 minutes and the camera drops down to it's native IR LED illumination, it's a minimal black and white picture but yet you can make out details and shapes.  Enough that it would be evidence for the police.  With my setup, a criminal would have to be Houdini to not trigger one of the other of my side lights.My installation?  I took a 1 X 8 piece of solid fir wood and made a \"tombstone\" shaped piece of wood (rounded corners on one end), sanded it and painted it to match the color of the house.  I then attached the camera at the end of the wood piece that had rounded corners.  I then attached the whole thing - camera and brackets  11.5 feet above ground up on the side of my house - just under the rafter.  This works pretty good as the 1ft of \"stick out\" length puts it right above our side door way.  I can see the front edge of the top step out into the middle of the street we are on.I did my own Ethernet cable pull (in the attic) and yes drilled the hole in the side of my house.  If you have never done this kind of thing or want a more professional looking install, you'll probably want to hire an electrician.NOTE:  If your switch or recorder does not support delivering \"POE\" (Power Over Ethernet) then you * could * use an old-skool DC power adapter (NOT included) to power this dome via another connector Hikvision provides that \"Y\"s off the main Ethernet connector cable.  That's a lot of extra hassle in my book - would involve providing a power outlet near your camera but the option is there for you.  You can buy a good POE \"Injector\" for $28.00 or a marginal/basic 4 Ports of POE starting at $59.00 on Amazon.UPDATE:  Jan 1st, 2014  I have decided to lower resolution to 1900 X 1080 (down from 2048 X 1536) in order to gain a full 30 frames per second framerate (instead of the previous limit of 15fps).  For people walking 15fps might be OK but for cars zooming by or people running, I think 30 fps is better.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "I got a brand WINIC camera, not a HIKVision, it looks and performs the same thus far", "Author": "Hellen E Hek", "ReviewID": "R2YSWK7QP8Q9DU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got a brand WINIC camera, not a HIKVision, it looks and performs the same thus far.. but who knows, the listing should be adjusted!", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "NOT HIKVision camera!", "Author": "T & J", "ReviewID": "RK6ONGV8EDJDN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received two cameras that looked very similar to the HIKVision camera, but they were actually knock-offs and are these:  http://winictech.com/product/px-ipd213/The boxes have the WINIC logo (not HIKVision) and the cameras are not branded.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great quality", "Author": "Jasper Warden", "ReviewID": "R1I8CTN81PX2QD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Works great... complicated to set up with PC software.

Make sure you do not purchase from HD Security store if you want to receive an actual Hikvision camera.1/8/13 I'll have to say I'm not a camera expert, but as a tech guy I really like this camera. My original setup included about 5 Foscam cameras I was using for daylight surveillance from inside. I finally set up this camera wired with PoE on the outside of my house under the eve in the backyard. The picture quality is awesome during the day, but I'm having a little trouble with IR bleeding/reflection at night. I plan to clean the dome in case it's my fault during the install, or it may be reflecting from nearby wall and gutter.

I ultimately like the camera, especially for the price. I would probably recommend this camera to anyone who either plans to use the embed software for monitoring or anything that supports H.264 protocol.Here's where I was disappointed.  I'll state that it's more about my setup and less about the camera assuming the caveat of H.264. I use Sighthound, formally Vitamin D, which has a profile for the Hikvision camera.  I also upgraded my firmware on the camera to 5.1 (that was a PITA unto itself finding where to download it from).Using the default settings out of the box with or without the upgrade from 5.0.2 to 5.1 I frequently see video distortion \"smearing\" of the image for a second or so on the bottom 2/3 - 1/3 of the screen in any resolution / frame rate using the \"main stream\". However if I switched to RTSP configuration on Sighthound and selected the Channel 2 stream (sub stream) I was able to stream in MJPEG, but at a max resolution of 704x480.  The distortion / \"smearing\" has gone away, but I've had to sacrifice pretty much all video formats above VGA (640x480).I will be honest however I'm not certain if this is an existing issue with Sighthound or Hikvision, but for me was a major downer.

This camera and the Foscam are two completely different cameras. For use as an indoor baby monitor with PTZ capability, the Foscam its great. I mention the Foscam because the built quality between it and the Hikvision DS-2CD2132-I is night and day. The Hikvision is obviously a stripped down, consumer version of a professional security camera.  The hardware is solid and the onboard configuration software is excellent. The NVR software is also quite nice, but I will probably stick with Blue Iris. We shall see how long this camera holds up.I should mention that the first camera I ordered was defective. I could not detect it on my LAN with the included software and when I pinged it there was 75% packet loss. I returned it for a full refund and ordered a second. The second one is currently mounted above my front door and the HD image is awesome.An outdoor, vandal-proof camera for less than $200 is a sweet deal.

The 2.8mm versions of these cameras have a piece of foam around the lens that is too large and covers the first row of IR lights. This causes some reflective issues and IR bleed and reduces the picture quality greatly at night. To help minimize this try your best to make sure the foam is pressed up tightly against the dome. In bright areas (or when IR is off), the 3 MP lens will give you a real clear image in 2048 x 1536 resolution.  This camera is meant to be mounted on a ceiling with the 2-axis mount lens but there are brackets you can purchase for wall mounting (dome will still be mounted horizontally). I still prefer the Hikvision DS-2CD2032-I Outdoor HD 3MP IP Bullet Security Camera 4mm over this camera when possible but when a dome is needed or a wider Field Of View (FOV), this camera works great. The camera doesn't lose connection and is very stable and reliable.The camera has POE (Power Over Ethernet) capabilities which means you don't have to plug the camera into a power source, you simply need a POE Injector which will power the camera via the ethernet cable. However, you may plug the camera in if you do not wish to use POE.Please keep in mind that in order to mount and adjust the angle of the lens on this camera, you will need a tamper proof torx wrench (torx wrench with the hole in the middle).
