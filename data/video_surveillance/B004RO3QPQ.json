But after some \"testing\", it is truly worth every penny and more.Pros:This unit does pick up all the common (and to my knowledge, only) frequencies/bands used by police. It picks up the speed traps that tell you how fast you're going. My local PD uses laser, it picks it up. I've been on the highway and picked up a really strong Ka Band. Looked around, saw nothing and thought it was a false alarm. Sure enough, a little bit later, a unit sitting in the median. It had picked up the signal way before I was in view of the car. The buttons are responsive and it gives you tones to let you know you turned that feature on or off. Adjustable volume, I usually keep it at 9 or 10 (I usually listen to music and drive a loud car). Overall, very impressed.Cons:This does get a fair enough number of false hits. Every time I drive by a local bank, it alerts to X band. I generally disregard the X and K band, as most police are now using the Ka and Laser/Lidar systems. And false alerts are going to be an issue with every radar detector not equipped with GPS. Also the display is worse than useless if the sun is directly on it. But for the price, you cannot go wrong with this unit.Random info:I have it hardwired to turn on with the car. It's mounted on the dash with double stick tape, centered, that way it has a clear view of the front and back window, and i dont have to worry about the suction cups ever coming off the windshield.", "Date": "April 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Breaking the Law, Breaking the Law", "Author": "HeatherLynn", "ReviewID": "R61X7S2D5TYXM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my BF for Valentines day (Romantic I know)....does it guarantee 100% protection from advancing technology used by police officers?

However! It only gives you roughly a half mile notice before a police cruiser is coming toward you. On some roads, this may be too late. I personally enjoy it because the few encounters where the police had their radars on it gave me a solid warning because there was turns in the road. NOTICE: this radar ONLY picks up police cars when they have their speed radars on. There are many police cars I've seen where it does not alert me simply because they don't run radar in their cars.

Everybody in my family has a radar detector and this Cobra was pretty disappointing actually. The volume is not loud enough in my opinion even turned up all the way, compared to other detectors, especially the way it steps down the volume after the initial warning. You can barely see any of the indicator lights because they are behind dark grey plastic --and it wasn't even a sunny day. It's so dim you literally can't even tell if it's on or not. The way it shows the radar signal power with three stacks of bars is poor and difficult to interpret especially since it is so dim. When my previous detectors went off going down the highway I could almost always find the cop eventually. I'm really not sure what this one went nuts for a dozen times and I drove about 150 miles trying to test it objectively. I was totally unimpressed. It makes you wonder who designs junk like this anyway. Nobody with any common sense much less any fuzzbuster design experience, that's for sure.
