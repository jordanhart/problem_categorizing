Some are running under the vents outside and some through walls into the room where the DVR is. Rain or shine, all seems to hold well and I have not picked up interference at all. This is a dual cable only - power and video so if you need audio, look elsewhere. The connections fit proper and snugly (power connection hold nicely) but to protect it from moisture and condensation I was using outside electric tape at first but eventually am switching to PlasticDip. It's great - just use some alcohol moistened cloth to clean (unpowered) connection point and then I took a 2\" wide brush and painted PlastiDip all around it. Once cured, it's solidly sealed from the elements. It's outer coat has not been easily cut yet either (which a few time I'm surprised).I am happy saving a couple bucks per 65' cable since I have about 6 cams now with 2 nanny cams going in soon. They fit connections from Swaan cams, QSee indoor/outdoor bullet style, and the generic dome NV cam. No complaints so far and it's been 3 or so months now of freezing and icy weather. This was installed running from outside in during August weather so it's been through some warm season as well. I like them.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Quality cable good price", "Author": "scrapant", "ReviewID": "R2G5P9J9CQBHW2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased one of these cables last week for $6.00. There was only one left in stock. The price is almost double now.This cable is well constructed, definatly a thicker guage. Better for your higher amperage camera's.

The first had a minor ding in the cable but the cosmetic flaw did not affect performance and the second one was perfect.  It is far more sturdy than the flimsy cable that came with a camera I bought.
