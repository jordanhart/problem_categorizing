The IR does work just fine in the dark. The system is very easy to set up. Plug and play so it takes very little effort to figure out the set up. I had the system up and working in mere minutes. As with all cameras the picture is much, much clearer with light. The daytime picture is very clear and you get a much better night pic with an IR light. I use them for ghost hunting and for a lower cost type system it performs very well. You sure can't beat the return on the investment.  For home security purposes it works great too. Nice system for the price.", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$519.99", "Features": "8 Channel Security DVR\n8xCMOS 480TVL Outdoor Camera\nSupport Live View with IE & Mobile Phone\nSupport LAN or Internet Browsing Remote Access\n24/7 Recording over 16 Days with 1TB HD", "Name": "ZMODO 8 CH CCTV H.264 Security DVR System + 8 Outdoor IR Waterproof Camera With 1TB Hard Drive Pre-installed", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41iBnJTHajL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008JRR8QA"}}
