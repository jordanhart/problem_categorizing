The monitor is very user-friendly, completely portable, and smart.  Does everything we wanted- motion senses, records to motion, has audio also, and night vision capability. The cameras are sleek, sturdy, light-weight, and mounts anywhere.  We ordered 2 extra cameras (also come in white, so aren't easily seen under eaves) right away. So far we're extremely pleased!", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$324.99", "Features": null, "Name": "Uniden Guardian Advanced Wireless Security System with 2 Surveillance - G766", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31OaNtIRfSL.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BX7P2S4"}}
