It was easy to install even programmed it myself. You must have a installer or dealer code to program the screen into the main system. Good luck getting that. Must wont tell you. Thay want to charge you a service call. With ADT its a $100 so I was told. The instruction tell you what to do walk you right thew. Just run the RF test first that's when I got good signal. Great display on 3.5 screen easy to see till you try read from help a bit small there. Talking is clear. If your main location is at another place then were you live like mine . I enter threw the basement but spend most my time up stairs.

Rather then pay full retail I picked one up used and when i first plugged it in i was so disappointed because it had unwanted options on the screen that i had never seen before, and lacked options that i was use to / wanted. I was thinking it was a software version difference thing, and i didn't know how i was going to able to rectify that. But anyway, I went ahead and learned the keypad into my Simon XTi panel, and was smiling to see that as I learned it, it was loading the specifics for my system, and when it was complete, whamo! The screen looked just like the other one in my home...Anyway, these things are great. They have all of the same basic options as the main panel, and are sleek looking. The also double as an additional siren, which is half the reason I bought it. While i have the siren turned off on the one on my upper level (false alarms suck by the bedrooms when everyone is sleeping), I did want an additional siren in the basement.So I highly recommend these touchpads, and i also highly recommend the Simon XTi control panel, ESPECIALLY if you are already using the older non-touchscreen XT Simon panel --- it's well worth the upgrade to the XTi!!", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Features, but has some problems", "Author": "Gator", "ReviewID": "RUG9JN8JP433V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love the screen and features. Programs well with my GE Simon. Main problem is that, the Stay and Away buttons are right next to each other, and there is no confirmation that you pressed the right one unless you wait for the arming sequence to complete (typically 45 sec or more). About the third time we used it, the alarm went off in the middle of the night because it was set to Away instead of Stay. My wife had set it and I had actually watched her - she pressed the correct Stay button. But she has long fingernails, and apparently due to the angle of her finger when pressing, it activated the wrong setting - NOT GOOD. There should be a confirmation on the screen after you press it. Also the unit has a problem that it will not always disarm when entering the code. It just reverts back to the main screen. Usually it works on the second try, but several times I've had to go to the main unit to disarm it before it alarmed.", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Generally pleased, though wireless interference left me initially dissatisfied.", "Author": "Peter Rodick", "ReviewID": "RLLITZD970K84", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "EDIT 12/2/13:  I've left my initial review intact below, but felt it would only be fair to update this review with some new information and upgrade from 1 star.After a few weeks of frustrating use, the inconsistent communication with the main panel seems to have resolved itself. Nothing has changed about my setup, so my best guess that the reason for the marked improvement was a recent reboot of my wireless router (for an unrelated reason). I suspect that when it booted back up, it detected interference from my Simon XT system and auto-selected a clear channel. Whether or not that was indeed the cause of poor panel-touchpad communication, I can say that I am infinitely happier with the touchpad's communication and responsiveness in the past week, and my initial 1-star review was unfair given that the issue seemed to be an external problem.-----ORIGINAL:I recently self-installed a Simon XT system in my house, which was a refreshingly simple process (gone are the days of cryptic menus and obtuse codes). Thus far--and it's only been a couple months since installation and a week since activiation--I'm thrilled with every component of the system EXCEPT the talking touchscreen. It functions like a buggy, beta-version holdover from the advent of touchscreen and wireless technologies.My biggest gripe is its finicky communication with the main panel. My touchscreen sits about 20 feet from the panel with a couple walls in between--well within reasonable range (and I've experimented with moving the touchscreen within 5 feet of the panel with identical results). It seems to receive signals quickly (if I set the alarm from the main panel, the touchscreen chirps an acknowledgement within a second or two), but sending signals to the main panel is a false-alarm crapshoot. When entering my code via the touchscreen to disarm the system, sometimes it disarms with the first attempt, but seemingly more often the signal never makes it to the main panel, requiring multiple attempts. Sometimes it takes two or three tries, sometimes it simply doesn't work, and the alarm goes off, and I curse GE under my breath while explaining to my diligent monitoring company that all is fine. And yes, I'm certain I entered the correct code.To a lesser degree, the responsiveness of the touchscreen leaves much to be desired. It's workable, but you'll likely find yourself exiting menus you never intended to access more frequently than you ought. I would have been dazzled by this technology 5+ years ago, but in an age where everyone carries an extremely responsive touchscreen in their pocket, this frustrates.This unit's only value in my estimation is as a secondary display to monitor your system's status. I actually really do like being able to quickly glance at it and see if a door is open or the system is armed. For that, it can have a star.NOTE: I even ordered a second touchscreen from a different vendor to compare, thinking I may have simply received a bad apple. Nope. They all suck. And a little Googling confirms its many documented bugs.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00HXQR5Z2"}}
