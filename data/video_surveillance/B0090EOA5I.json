Buyer Beware! These cameras have a decent picture but certainly not anything like the other comments by other \"purchasers\" hmmm.... The standard Zmodo cameras that came with my DVR actually have a much clearer and brighter picture. Look around before you buy.\"", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Blurry Waste of Money2", "Author": "Hicoteo", "ReviewID": "R3GUJHFHSTUSI2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "These are very nice compact inconspicuous cameras. The IR is not too bad. You can make out things perhaps 40 feet away in dim light.However, when it comes down to it image quality is everything and the image with these is horrendous! It is blurry and I cannot even recognize people I know from 15 feet away. I use these for apartment building security and have already accused the wrong person of leaving a door open because of the poor image.I am very disappointed with this purchase. I thought I was buying better then average cameras because the ad says Sony and for the longer reach IR. If I didn't live overseas I would return them.If there is a way of focusing these things please let me know and maybe I can bump the rating up. I'm annoyed!", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "OEM product", "Author": "DontBelieveTheHype", "ReviewID": "R3QTR9MEC6VHIJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I thought I was ripped off when I received a plain brown box and cameras that do not say ZMODO on them.
