The installation was reasonably simple once the RCA adapter was found inside the box. The biggest concern with installation was finding a power source for the camera on the outside of my house. For many people the need for a power source near the camera will be a deciding factor as to whether or not to buy a wireless or wired system. (Wireless systems require a power source near the camera to run the wireless transmitter.) The receiver is located in the center of my house with the signal traveling through several walls and a brick facade. Despite this, the picture is still clear on my TV. The video only refreshes a few times per second giving a choppy display as you would expect from a security camera and not a webcam. There is no audio included with this system; however, if you're looking for a wireless digital security camera with good range and picture quality and connects to most devices, this camera may be a good choice for you.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "NEVER PURCHASE A LOREX PRODUCT!!!", "Author": "Declaredinsane", "ReviewID": "R1B40M2PA0GMXJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased 2 Lorex LW2110 Wireless Digital Security Cameras and one was damaged.

Setup is relatively easy with the only problem is being able to power the camera in a remote location. There are 2 settings for viewing, a 640 x 480, 12fps mode and a more smooth, 320x240, 30 fps mode which is controlled via a button on the receiver. The night viewing capability is excellent in low light conditions and is easily capable of viewing up to 60ft as stated on the box.Pros:+ Easy setup+ Low light capabilities+ Wireless+ Weather proof housingCons:- Limited spatial resolution- Slow frame rates at higher resolution- Not network capableThe LW2110 field of view is more suitable for a store shop surveilance than any kind of \"long\" range (i.e 60ft) surveillance. The spatial resolution of the camera makes it very hard to determine what a person is doing 60ft away let alone identify a person. The slower frame rate for higher resolution mode is also very degrading to the imagery. Things can easily be missed by dropped frames along with this low frame rate. I understand the lower frame rate is most likely to preserve bandwidth but with all the wireless technologies available I would expect better performance than 12fps at 640x480.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Does not do as promised", "Author": "Dean L.

I had no trouble whatsoever connecting the power cords to both the camera and wireless receiver, and the video cable from the receiver to the RCA video input jack of my television.  I used the supplied BNC-to-RCA adapter jack.I haven't decided where to place the camera yet so I didn't mount it but connected it to its stand then placed it freestanding on the ledge behind our front window in the living room, looking out to the porch and across the street. The video is better than I expected.  I was expecting something rather fuzzy and choppy, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well detailed it is, with accurate colors and it also picks up movement well.  Naturally it is not as good as watching a television or DVD picture but for monitoring purposes it is just fine. I don't see the need for any higher resolution.The television is about 40 feet from the camera. Not a direct line-of-sight but there are open doorways between the two devices. The signal strength meter showed a strong connection.Cons: The only real cons I can list are (1) cable management (just more cords to have to organize, but they are thin and easy to manage) and the placement limitation that comes from the length of the cords.  I would say for most applications the supplied cords are sufficient, however.The build quality of the camera is good.

It is amazing in the dark, too.  I get crystal clear black & white at night.  I've got the camera set about 8 feet from the window so don't think you'll get that level of detail from 60 ft., but I can make out details on my garage (light fixture, siding) and that's probably 40 ft. away.

It took a bit of adjustment but we finally got a good signal coming from the camera, located outside on an outbuilding at a distance of around 70 feet from the house through brick and interior walls, which surprised us for such a relative cheapo unit. We've had it for about 4 months now and it still works well, giving us a fairly decent picture of what we want to see outside the house. It does flicker at times in what looks like an attempt to deal with strange lighting conditions outside (not often though), and it also switches over to night vision consistently well when the light level gets low enough. NIght vision is good to adequate. The camera serves our needs. We had one problem early on with signal dropping that the tech rep on the phone (Mumbay India probably) couldn't help us with very much - kept trying to get very technical and off target in our opinion. We finally remembered, \"When in doubt, Reboot,\" so we pulled the plug out of the receiver unit and put it back in again....problem solved. Another point to know is that the receiver unit antenna is apparently extremely sensitive (at least OURS is), so that you can get dramatically differing signal strengths with just very small adjustments of the angle of the antenna. The location of the wires that may be around or near the antenna also has an effect on signal strength, so try fiddling with those when trying to get that sorted out.", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Started out good but declined rapidly.", "Author": "D.

Being wireless, it was very simple to set up - plug in the camera power, plug in the receiver and hook up your video.Just in case there's any doubt, this is a security cam so there is NO SOUND.There are two settings - a low res/high refresh (320x240 30FPS.  Resolution is slightly worse than the traditional TV quality) and a high res/low refresh (640x480 12FPS) which is closer to DVD resolution, but a bit jerky.  I'd think most people would want the second setting.  There's a not so easy to see button on the receiver that controls this setting.Night vision is very good - apparently the cheaper security cameras don't use a IR filter and consequently colors and highlights look very unusual.  The Lorex corrects for this (color correct in daylight) and still gives very good low light visibility (B/W images).  Box states 60 feet - I haven't confirmed, but I could easily see 35 feet (to the end of our drivewayField of view is wide so while I get a great view of our entire 2 car driveway pad, by the time you get to the end of the driveway a person's face is pretty small.

I have four already installed and they work flawlessly. I have a motor home that is parked about 75 feet from the house and one side is not visible from the house. Since I already have a 120v outlet live in the motor home, installation of this camera took five minutes completely. Three of that was getting in and out of the motor home. I set the camera down in one end and it has an extremely clear view of the length of the motor coach. No adjustments of any kind were required. Plug and play. Of course the camera transmits wireless data, in packets, so the view is not going to be smooth as silk 'normal motion' but a kind of clip frame thing. That is perfectly normal with a wireless camera. Colors are quite good and clarity is good enough to make out the face of someone in the field of view. You do need a live 120v plug fairly close to where you set up the camera. If wireless cameras of any quality ran on batteries you would be changing batteries every two days.

I did some testing by having someone walk by causing an alert and watch what happens. By the time the alert was passed through the wireless portal the person had passed and was not recorded.  Using fulltime recording for this camera allowed the person to be recorded but then you have to review a lot of data.

I set a monitor above my desk and I can see it out of the corner of my eye. It's worked OK, but every time a plane flies over, or I move my laptop (near the receiver), or shift in my chair the picture flakes out a bit, like an old TV with rabbit ears. After a while this flakiness becomes annoying (it's hard to ignore because it always looks like something's happening out of the corner of my eye). So, I wanted to try this camera.The results are... some things better... some things worse:With the old camera, which had only 420x320 resolution (vs 640x480 in this camera), I could tell which of my neighbors was walking on the sidewalk  across the street (50-75 ft away), or which one of the two grandkids (3 years apart in age) next door was running down the street. With this camera, I can clearly see a person, and could probably judge pretty well if the person was a grownup vs a young child. But, I couldn't tell you who the person was because the video quality is not as good.The new camera is located exactly where the old camera was. It's indoors, facing out of a 2nd floor window at the front of the house. I'm in the basement, also at the front of the house. So, the signal has to travel maybe 25-30 ft, through two floors (I align the antennas to be parallel to each other). This camera reports 4 bars of signal strength.... should be great! Well, I don't get anywhere near 12 frames/second. It's more like 2-4 frames/second. The old camera was close enough to 30 frames/sec to look like true video. At 30 frames/second you can understand the scene much better (the mind combines many frames to discern better detail than resolution alone can provide). I tried the lower resolution setting... it did not help... it was twice as fast, but worse resolution and more blur (or data compression issues). I think this camera might be somewhat out of focus, but this is hard to tell... it might just be because of the slow update rate.The brightness control also seems a little off. Interesting that their youtube video is from a southern house exposure, so the whole scene is BRIGHT. In this case, the AGC does just fine adjusting the brightness. The manual says that you need to place your camera where the whole scene is at the same brightness. Ummmm, that seems to suggest that you can't use it on a north or east or west facing wall of the house (where there might be big shadow areas). It's not THAT bad, but in my case, when 25% of the scene is in shadow, the bright part of the scene is way too bright, and the darkest parts of the scene are black (so, grays in the scene look fine, and whites and blacks don't show well.... for those geeks out there: it's like the dynamic range is not all that good).But, the good news is that there is no flicker to the picture. Any frame that is shown looks as expected... no distortion. So, I think you either lose a frame update or get a perfect transmission of the frame. I can walk around my room, move my laptop, move the receiver, NO DISTORTION. And, the color is great.Overall, for me, I think I'lll keep the camera. I can't discern my neighbors, but I can tell the weather, see a delivery truck, and hopefully be able to discern a solicitor vs neighbor as they walk up my driveway. Recently, I covered the LED lights (but not the light sensor) so that it will work (as well as it can) at night (I'm looking through a window so I can't have the LEDs blasting a light that will reflect off the window). Being an engineer, I may eventually dig into the camera and see if I can focus this a little better (probably a tricky and very risky process of adjusting the distance between lens and sensor).", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lorex LW2110 wireless digital security camera", "Author": "Roy Taylor", "ReviewID": "R3ODA6SXCWA9VN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this item for outside security servalence and it is very clear.

When that happens, nothing happens! You can see a picture on the monitor but it could be 5 seconds or 5 hours old.The solution, as such, was judicious positioning of the receiver until such time as the \"Connecting\" message disappeared from the monitor.

It is very easy to setup. Just plug in the power on the camera and the receiver. That's about it. However, there are some problems that I've seen after owning 2 of these cameras in the last few months.PROS:- Decent picture quality, color & clarity- Acceptable & OK night vision picture- Wireless solution, no running wires and drilling through walls etc- Affordable price point- Good mounting hardwareCONS:- Wireless range is not that far (it doesn't seem to cover end-to-end of a 1100 sqf floorplan). This means that if you have your receiver in the back of the house and the camera at the front door/gate of a typical single home. You may not have it covered. Video will come in and out. The receiver will keep saying \"connecting..\" and signal bars will be low.- Of the 2 cameras I have, one (at short range 20ft away line-of-sight/no walls) would disconnect completely and would not reconnect by itself. This happens randomly. Sometimes it would work for week+ and sometimes it took just a few days. I had to power-cyle the camera or hit the reset button below it's rear antenna stub. Yes, it's very hard to see since it's the same plastic and same color like the camera itself. Just put your finger there and feel it - then press the darn thing. :D It's easier for me to just unplug the power cord from the wall socket and reset it. This defeats the purpose of a security camera as it has un-controllable outage.So I have one camera that shows better functionality. It has lower signal due to farther mount and going through 1-wall. It would disconnect and reconnect itself when needed. All it needs is just some adjustments raising or lowering etc to get better signal. And it's working good so far.LONG-TERM UPDATE 01/28/2013:The posted issue as I've seen above is aggravating and it happened to BOTH cameras I have. The camera or receiver would not produce a picture (don't know which but had to reset both to make sure). Just a black screen is shown once after every few days/weeks. What an annoying failure. I either have to reset the power to the receiver or the camera to have the picture back. Gawd... it's really painful. Then again, I can't afford to run wires throughout the house for fixed cable cameras... I really hope we'll have better technology to deal with this kind of issue.

Easy to install, and with great picture quality.Here's the thing, it says it can show via your monitor or television or DVR.  True, but unless you want to sit there and simply watch, you must have a DVR.  I had wanted to use it to see what wildlife roams my yard at night (we live in the country).  But I don't have a DVR.  So it worked great as long as I sat and watched it on my big flat screen.  But there's no way I could have recorded it without a DVR so my plan failed.  Maybe if I heard a noise and flipped the TV on, it could work.The advertising for it to me is a bit vague...it doesn't really explain why the DVR is so essential.  I'm guessing that the \"security DVR\" they recommend with the extra cameras would up the price significantly in order to be actually useful.The viewing field is fairly narrow-but the picture is very clear.", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "A very good security cam", "Author": "\u0134\u0134", "ReviewID": "RUAOMBH6ETYUU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "While the Lorex LW2110 Wireless Digital Security Camera is probably not something that you're going to see used in a high class department store, it's still a really good camera that can be used at home or in a small business.The materials that come in the box include the following: the camera, a mounting stand, some screws, the receiver, a BNC/RCA adapter, 2 power adapters (plug ins), a BNC male/female extension cable, and a power splitter (only to be used with a 2 pack, which this is not).  Once I had everything out of the box and spread out, it was relatively easy to figure out what went where.The camera being attached to the mounting stand is probably the most difficult part, considering that you have to partially take the stand apart to be able to twist the camera on.  You are then able to screw the mounting stand to wall and adjust the angle of how the camera points.  After you finish that, you can attach the camera's wire to the wall plug in and plug it into the wall.  This completes the camera portion of the installation.Next is the receiver.  To start, you must attach the BNC/RNA adapter to the receiver; however, since just attaching the adapter probably won't give you the length you will need to be able to plug into the wall AND television, you will probably want to first use the BNC extension cable.  This requires you to simply pop one end onto the receiver and connect the other end to the BNC/RNA adapter.  Then you plug the adapter into the video output location on your TV (it should be a yellow circle).  You can then attach the receiver to the plug in and get electricity going to the receiver which should obviously be connected to the TV.It may all sound very complicated with all of the technical names, but it's actually really quite simple.  I'm usually not that handy with these types of installations, but this one was a breeze!Once you complete both installations, everything should be working.  Your TV should be showing the image of what the camera is pointing at.  Do remember that you'll want your TV on the same component that you would watch your VCR/DVD player on, though.  If it still isn't working, the manual has a good troubleshooting section that you can refer to.The picture is definitely not HD once on the TV, but it's still quite clear for a security camera.  Movement is somewhat choppier than a video camera, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well the security camera picked up movements.When it is placed in a dark environment or a light goes off where it had been a lit environment, the camera automatically clicks into night vision, which is a black and white type of view.  Everything is still very visible and movement was still picked up rather well.The receiver should work about 400-450 feet in an open location and about 100-150 feet in a location with blockage such as walls.  When I tried to bring the camera about 130-140 feet outside my home, the receiver wouldn't pick up a signal, probably because it was going through about 3 walls to try to get the camera's image; so obviously, the more walls it goes through, the fewer feet away you'll be able to place the camera from the receiver.  If this is hugely disappointment, then know that there is a way to strengthen the receiver by buying a type of kit, which is explained in the manual.As far as I can tell, the camera is not able to record what it is broadcasting, so if you're looking for something that does, this security camera isn't for you.This camera is definitely a really good security camera as long as you're going to monitor it on your TV.  I do wish the signal strength was a little bit better and that it ran on a battery instead of having to plug into a wall, but overall, I'm quite satisfied with it.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "You need a DVR", "Author": "Lauren A.", "ReviewID": "R3M0O26M29YHYS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If you don't have a DVR you can't record images, limiting the usefulness of this device for surveillance.
