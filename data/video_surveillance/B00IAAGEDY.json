Im very pleased to share my thoughts about this product. My first thoughts were low about the product when I purchased online because I paid a fraction of the cost of other dvr system, I said I paid cheap money so I would get a cheap system. But I was completely wrong!.. the system is very nice I love it. Easy to setup and I get emails alerts on my phone whenever someone opens my garage. Also I can see it anywhere any time and I think that\u2019s really cool, I feel like a secret agent watching my cameras from anywhere. I called tech support to set it up and they did everything for me that\u2019s a big plus and the tech support is free.. I would not change my system for anything im very happy and I hope this review would help you guys cleared out that the products is very good at a good price.", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "keeping an eye on your property", "Author": "jojo", "ReviewID": "R36GBR0BGV03V8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "got this to setup some home security.  It pretty much does what it is suppose to.  got it set up to watch down some critical locations.  it records, and can playback for review later.  1TB of space seems like plenty of recording time for my purposes.  seems well built, and sturdy, and like it can weather a lot of outdoor conditions.setup was pretty easy, got some tech support for the company.  called in, and was very nice to talk to someone about some questions I had during setup.  They also have some instructional youtube videos to help you during setup.recommend for anyone that is price conscious, but would still like to beef up some extra security and keep an eye on their property.", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00IAAGEDY"}}
