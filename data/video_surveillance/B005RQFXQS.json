I was looking at Motorola, but didn't want to overpay for the functions I thought I won't use (tilt/pan, room temp), so I decided to go with this simpler and cheaper monitor.Here is the quick summary:pros: the video quality is goodcons: sound quality is HORRIBLE. Even with the sound turned on to the max you can barely hear that your child is crying if you have TV or music turned on, or if you're in the kitchen and have running water. It also has a lot of static noise in the background which makes it really hard to hear what's going on in the nursery.. If you're monitoring a younger baby, it's OK, but my older one likes to talk a lot before falling asleep and after waking up, and I can't understand what she is saying, even when I listen very careful.If you have a few cameras, the monitor won't automatically switch between them when the noise is detected. Right now I have my kids sleeping in separate rooms and I need to constantly manually switch between cameras to check on them.The monitor is very light, in fact it's so ridiculously light that it's own cord drags it down from my nightstand!Camera's cord is very short.I kinda regret now that I decided to save money and went with this option.

It works so much better & shows no signs of interference with other electronic devices. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars in simply because of the camera range in the dark. We cannot see my son's bed clearly in the dark with the camera positioned on the other side of the room. It's not a big room by any stretch of the imagination. In our baby's room, we can clearly see the crib when the camera is positioned within 5 feet of the crib, but in our son's room, the bed is approximately 10-15 feet from the camera, and with the lights out, you cannot clearly make out anything beyond say 5 feet or so. We positioned several spot-light type night lights around the room & this still did not remedy the problem. I believe we'll have to move the camera above the bed in order to see better. Also, if you don't install batteries into the cameras & the power goes out, you have to set up the whole system again. This is not difficult, but it is also not exactly intuitive - you do need the instructions. Overall we are very happy with this system.
