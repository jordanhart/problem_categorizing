Brumfield", "ReviewID": "R2EXKB0O7Z25HQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a balance between price, channels, camera quality, and Mac support, and the Q-See QT548 fit all the requirements. I have had it installed for a year now, and it is functioning as well as the first day. We have relied heavily on this system, following a break-in at our home, the features, alarm/motion capability, and ability to tie it in with our existing alarm system, has provided a level of peace to us that is priceless.On the negative side, it seems that this version does not get updated - at least I have not seen them improve upon the software or firmware at all since we installed it, but that said, it has been working very well as-is. The iPhone app works very well, and fills the gaps created by the lack of Active-X web controls (windows-only) on the Mac, even though the Mac browser interface works for most things, it does not control all of the features like the click-and-drag-and-drop time range settings for the alarms and schedulers. I have to do all of that through the console or the iPhone app, but that's okay.I bought a $5 18\" LCD monitor from Goodwill and dedicated it to the Q-SEE system, and mounted it all on a rack in our basement, so that we can interact with it directly if needed.It has been a true value to us.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$869.99", "Features": "Real Time Full D1 Recording Resolution\n8 Channel DVR / Pre-installed hard drive 1TB\nRemote internet monitoring (up to 10 users at the same time)\nMobile Phone Surveillance\nCompatible with MAC and PC", "Name": "Q-See 8 Channel H.264 1TB Security DVR w/ HDMI output QT548-1", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31Ii5QX6I%2BL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00AOB8FJ8"}}
