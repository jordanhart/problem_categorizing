It look nicer and work better than the cheap cameras that came with my system. and wider angle as well, The night vision is good for the area I have it in which is my front porch area that is able 8ft high and 4ft by 4ft, the LED's can be seen but seem to be dimmer then my other cameras and do stand out as much.. Very easy to mount with up to 4 screws through a detachable base.Great camera for the price.4 starsI purchased this camera to replace another dome camera. This camera has good resolution and color quality. It covered the entire front yard from a high point on a single home. The camera can be adjusted to view video in any direction  it is essentially plug-and-play so it was no big deal. Adjusting the direction is easy (unscrew the outter casing to loosen the grip, adjust the camera, and retighten). Image quality using IR in the dark was reasonable. Daytime vision is good in shady areas, but the instruction are vague, and Works better in daylight than at night. Thus the 4 stars instead of 5, but all-in-all a reasonable device that does what it's supposed to do.", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works well", "Author": "E.

The body is sturdy metal and the quality of the picture both day and night is far superior to the \"high\" resolution cameras that came with the system.  I switched this with the existing bullets and images are much sharper and clearer both night and day, and captures more space.  I am now going to replace the bullets with these.  For the price and quality it's a good deal.", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Conch-shaped dome camera", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R2XT5NJX8XNLVT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good camera, I like itI purchased this camera to monitor my store. It is a good value for the money.This camera is easy to set up and install. The small size and  conch-shaped appearance is very suitable for the indoor environment and fully adjustable for wall or ceiling mounting. And it is strongly solid with the Metal shell instead of the usual cheap plastic.3.6mm lens provides a wid*e view angle, so 2 conch-shaped camera is enough for my store. It captures my entire store, so i can easily monitor it on my computer without going around and observation. Now i can manage the store myself without any employee. As for the image quality, it's clear in daytime but a bit out of focus at night. However it's much better than those cameras which the DVR system comes with. Additionally, i find that there is not security decal, anyway, this item is worth price.Hope the seller can read the review and make some improvements.", "Date": "June 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "very nice camera.", "Author": "David J.

First off,I must say the unit is well made, small, about 3 inches wide, metal casing - NOT plastic, off-white color which blends in quite nicely with my wall, picture quality is acceptable considering that it's only 420TVL and not 700TVL, otherwise it would not be so cheap.  ***The \"wide angle\" part is questionable and that's my reason for not giving it a 5 star rating. The IR works very well at night, I was able to see myself in the dark and also the motion sensor was quick to give me away even in complete darkness.  Bottom Line - If you are looking for an inexpensive CCTV camera just to put in your house or  to look over the yard or garage and don't want to spend a fortune, you might want to consider this one.NOTE - Also keep in ind that this unit DOES NOT come with BNC to RCA adapter which you will need to plug it into your DVR or TV.", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "FAKE REVIEWS- 5 reviews on same date with no other reviews", "Author": "Donna \"donmarvin\"", "ReviewID": "R385GXQI3NHS1R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "There are 5 reviews dated Jan 20, 2013, none verified purchases, and all 5 reviewers had no other reviews except for an alarm clock (2 people with the same alarm clock).They didn't even TRY to make it look real.", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "good build and quality", "Author": "Henry", "ReviewID": "R236D4WZMVQ1CS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i was surprise to see a very good quality for the price of this camera, i highly recommend for everyone.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best bang-for-the-buck in NTSC day/night cameras", "Author": "Roman Pennington", "ReviewID": "RR3A3U304ANYJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've got a half dozen of these installed and have had them running for at least 6 months without any issues.

Iv'e had this for over a year now and purchased two of another brand at the same time. This is the only one I've ever had that has kept it's night vision all the others seem to go dark over time. This is a very well made camera and has held up well in the weather. I have it mounted under eave at the corner of my house and it receives lots of wind, rain, and snow. The design allows you to position it and then tighten it down so it stays in place which it does very well, I've never had to re adjust it. It is slightly difficult to position and rather confusing if you have taken it out of the shell to get everything lined up and mounted correctly with the camera in the proper orientation. But overall a good camera for the price. I will probably order more to replace the others if I don't upgrade to IP cameras.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "a very good device", "Author": "JOHN", "ReviewID": "R2RRSW6ACRMDYJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When some IR lights burned out on another type of camera I got a couple of these as replacements... a very crisp picture, better that most on IR.

I prefer wide-angle lens for home surveillance ,IR lights are visible to the naked eye, but are definitely powerful enough. They lit up a 25ft long room with no problem at all. I'm glad this unit includes a CCD instead of a CMOS chip, as the quality of the image is so much better!Unlike many other cameras, this one did not include a cable to hook into your DVR.
