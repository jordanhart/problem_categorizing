Units have a great image.  Crystal clear, colors are great too.  With IR I can easily see all my interior and exterior locations.  The vision does drop off closer to the 80' listed in the speck.  I am using mine over Cat5E of varied lengths between 50 and 100' with balun units I purchased here on AMAZON!!!!  I cannot tell any difference in video quality between a unit connected with their packaged 60' cable and my set up.Only con that I could even dream up would be that the view angle is less than 90 degrees (as with most security cameras) so in my case where the unit is mounted in the corner of the room you don't get the full view of the room.I do have a number of Samsung products and have been very pleased with the quality.  This unit is not letting me down.Thanks AMAZON", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "works great!", "Author": "Michael D.
