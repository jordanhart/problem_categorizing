Has a little bluish haze at dusk and dawn, when enough natural light is still available for the color circuit to be working, yet the IR lights are already on. The dynamic range of video could be better, but overall these cameras represent a great value.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "very good and convenient!", "Author": "usdigibuy", "ReviewID": "RNVHT8VI3X14Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Hootoo camera works as a reliable ccd camera. The daytime color is real nice and the night vision was better than I anticipated due to higher LED/c700tvl count. I\u2019m not sure on the exact range of the night vision, but it seems like it would easily reach across my 950 sq/ft house. The instruction manual is easy to read, and if you are saavy enough to setup a router at home, you can probably make do without it.Other thoughts: the build is solid, and the unit comes with a metalized body which is good for preventing vandalism. On the other hand, the glassy surface looks like it would be easy to scratch, so be careful when twisting the base and housing bezel together, and try to not use too much force. Overall, I have to say this is a great and inexpensive supplement cam for a security system and will be looking to purchase a few more.", "Date": "May 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for the price..", "Author": "James", "ReviewID": "R2FTT2BK733CGC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great resolution, you can see the 700 TV Line right away, just a great deal for the money. I needed something Overnight I was able to get this sent to me over night plug it up the next day and client was trilled. I will buy a few more in the very near future.

I added this unit to my CCTV home security system. I placed at the front door entrance to the house. I was very pleased with the finish on the camera. It looks very clean and professional.The quality of the picture is good, since I'm not running an HD setup. You can clearly make out the face of any person who walks up to the front door.Infrared works to about 20-25' in complete darkness.

I just finished installing it.  At first the picture was great.  After viewing the camera for about fifteen minutes I began to get a glow and unclear picture.  I am going to leave it on all night in hopes that the camera will readjust itself and give me a better picture.  I don't know what the outcome will be but I will update you later as to whether I get a better picture.UPDATE:I unpluged the camera for hours in hopes that it would reset itself. It did not work.  During daylight the picture is good. That was the reason the picture was good when I first installed it and as darkness came I noticed the picture became poor to none.  This was a bad buy and I've got to send it back for a refund.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Vivid colors and solid build", "Author": "New father", "ReviewID": "R364N0W6VBDF8D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The HT-CC003 dome camera comes with a 12V DC AC power converter (100 - 240V AC). Its video connector is BNC that is designed for professional surveillance DVR that I don't have. There are converters to convert BNC to RF (cable TV) or RCA. They can be bought online for about $1. I used a BNC to RCA converter and plugged it into my LCD TV's composite video port. This RCA port is shared with my TV's component port. Make sure you don't use a converter to plug into the RF port (cable TV port). You can use the RF cable for cable extension, but you need to convert RF to RCA to plug into your TV. (If you want to use your TV's RF input, you need a RCA to RF signal converter that is powered. It costs around $15 online. Not a simple wiring conversion in this case because RF is high frequency signal while RCA is for low frequency. The camera won't work on the high frequency RF port without signal conversion). I am pleased by the vivid colors and crisp image (standard TV aspect ratio). It looks much better than on my LCD TV screen than on my old glass-tube TV that I also tested. The manual says the camera has 700 TV lines, much higher than the 420 TV lines for the HT-CC001 and HT-CC002 models. The camera has an expensive CCD image sensor instead of the less expensive CMOS sensor on most wireless IP cameras. IR illumination is excellent in total darkness because the camera has 48 IR light bulbs with a photosensor to turn them on automatically. Under total darkness, I can see B/W image. The camera has a professional-grade aluminum casing. The base is easily removed to access the 4 holes for mounting screws. The camera ball-shaped head can be rotated to aim at different directions including upside down. I did not test it outdoors although the camera is waterproofed for outdoor use.The drawback of this camera is that it is not IP based camera. You need a DVR or TV/monitor for it. For its designed purposes, it works well. I give it 5 stars.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent value for the price", "Author": "Ivy Xu", "ReviewID": "RYAVMEOU7IM0D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great ccd camera that performs better than typical cameras you see with CMOS chips. I have had it up and running for a week, and it has been reliable thus far. The color during the day is better than most DVR security systems and the night vision better than I had expect....most likely due to higher LED count and higher TVL count. The IR night vision seems to reach about 50 feet which is probably enough for most homes.My only complaint is that the documentation is not perfect. Hopefully this product will last years to come and will withstand the test of time since it is advertised as both an indoors and outdoors camera. I will be updating my review if needed, but for the time being, I can say that I am impressed.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "What you pay is what you get.", "Author": "OmarC", "ReviewID": "R36A3E5FEUTNTM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Looks good, easy to install, does the job, clear image day and night.

It replaced a lesser quality camera, because I wanted a wider angle lens and sharper video.  It works good with the exist software I use; just connected it and got a wider and better video.  The camera covers our family room and the IR lights up the room so much at night that the IR LEDs from another camera do not turn on. The IR LED pattern is biased to the center, but so are all other cameras I have used. Too bad manufactures do not mount the LEDS so that they are arced a bit.I have other HooToo cameras that are wireless.  Like those, the shipping for this camera was fast. Assuming this camera continues to work well, I will be replacing another fixed camera for the same reasons.  In my opinion, the quality is very good for the price.

Requires wiring to the monitor. I used a 100' cable and mounted it on the garage. The wide angle lens allows me to view both the driveway and the sidewalk to my house. Per instructions I mounted it in a shielded area underneath the soffit where it will get no rain, snow or direct sunlight. The camera resolution is fine for my 19 inch monitor however when viewed on a large screen TV it is a bit grainy. Color rendition is excellent and the US flag blowing in the breeze in the yard shows its red, white and blue colors very well. When mounting it such that you need to move the eyeball socket to an extreme angle make sure to move the internal socket such that the lens aligns with the cut-out in the socket else the reflection from the inside of the internal socket of the IR at night will cause halos and artifacts which block the view.I am spoiled by my wireless remote cameras with their brilliant colors and also being able to control the pan, tilt and zoom features of those cameras, however for an inexpensive way to monitor a fixed location such as my driveway, this camera meets all of my expectations.  Good job HooToo!other thoughtsThe output of this camera s NTSC video which is superior to the digitized output of the wireless IP cams.  When viewing motion video with this camera the motion is smooth and continuous.  With the IP cameras a high speed car or person running is captured at a given FPS and sometimes results in a partial image capture.  Not so with this camera. The output connector is BNC as described in the data so be sure to have BNC to RCA adapters if you are going to use a standard monitor or TV.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "once again you get what you pay for", "Author": "Frederick Schiele", "ReviewID": "R47X9L2VXLW63", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "not a good camera for night view the day view is ok.If you want a good night camera dont get this one.", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good quailty - Night vision halo", "Author": "Robert T.
