{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Phantom 1, not Phantom 2", "Author": "C. Fink", "ReviewID": "R2QUNW2QAZI81E", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have not purchased this specific model from Amazon, but I did purchase the actual Phantom 2 off Amazon for $710.Just a word of warning for those that may not be as educated on these.  This is NOT the most recent version of the DJI Phantom.  This is the Phantom 1, with around 18 minutes run time.  If you are looking for the DJI Phantom 2, with the new Intelligent Battery System that carries a 25 minute run time and is compatible with the Zenmuse H3-2D gimbal, this is NOT the Phantom that you want.  Also, the propellers that come with this kit are not going to be the self-tightening propellers, as those are only compatible with the Phantom 2 (Vision & Non-Vision).Just trying to help those that may get into something they don't want.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "fun ship to fly", "Author": "Tim H.", "ReviewID": "R35RNAYHVHNOIE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Phantom and after the first accidentally starting the motors-it makes a darn good lawnmower! The prop guards were immediately mounted. It is so stable on gps mode that I have not flown it in any other mode Haven't attempted the go home feature. The price was good under $500. and is well worth the money invested. It also handles winds around 15mph. I live along a major hiway miles from any town and will hover this craft near the road and it does turn heads. Be sure to  watch the videos first and make sure you understand them. The lawn found out the hard way. the video from the gopro cam are good and no jello effect.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "DJI PHANTOM V1.1.1", "Author": "Brooke Harrison", "ReviewID": "R2BPPHE3U1ZDSD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I first saw the phantom, the completely encased frame style (as opposed to the open truss style arms, attatched to a central platform) sorta put me off. Seeing it just gave me a feeling of it being heavy, having more drag, and being less responsive, more of a toy than a machine with real functional uses. I couldn't have been more wrong! The advanced electronics in this sucker make it simple to fly and control, like the huge ones selling for ten times more. Its perfect for a go pro and after more than twenty flights, I can tell you that the big boys claim a 12-15 minute flight time with their Hexas and Octos, and thats exactly what I get with the Phantom. I have also been impressed with the durability as well, having flow it into trees many times now, and even a few ground impacts, and it has suffered no serious damage. I felt it was a good idea to use the blade guards for safety, but its my thinking that having those guards on there has saved it from serious damage, because I have broken some of them in my crashes, and I feel they took the main impact of the crash and the craft itself was unharmed. This is one item that really is as cool as it looks !!", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Austin Andersen", "ReviewID": "R3Q8ICO9YP4NHK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Some reviews stated they didnt get antivibration addon so I checked with seller before I bought and IT IS INCLUDED. I received with the addon as well. This is an excellent package and would highly recommend it at price or $499 which I paid. The guards are very handy but do add alot of girth to drone and makes it impossible to get a case for it. The antivibration is a must have (however I quickly realized I wanted a gimbal which I got on amazon for $100). The extra propellers are nice as I wasnt paying attention to battery and drone fell on 3rd flight. You will absolutely need extra batteries for this.As far as the DJI Phantom, can't be beat with simplicity. You must watch youtube videos to learn all the basics before flying, but it really is simple and easy to learn when you experiment on your own. I used my gopro 3+ silver and the videos are amazing.Couple test flights on youtube[...][...]DON'T HESITATE, BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BEST BUY ON AMAZON EVER", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Complete Quad-copter package.", "Author": "Capt.

When you first use the phantom take your time let it run through the start up sequence and remember to calibrate your compass . I first flew mine with out the gopro to get use to the controls witch response very smooth. The gopro video it takes from the birds eye view is assume . You might want to invest in extra battery's run time is about 7to 8 minutes with the stock battery . This package with the phantom is a great way to start out . If your on the fence about getting one, just get it you will want to fly it every chance you get .", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "terrible product and customer service", "Author": "Henry delahoz", "ReviewID": "R23ZKXEHEHAKZ4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i bought this as a gift for my 21 yr old son, it worked for 1 day then started having issues. we sent it in to DJI to have them look at it, after 2 weeks they hadnt even looked at it and trying to talk to them requires 1 hr waiting on the phone to even talk to them.
