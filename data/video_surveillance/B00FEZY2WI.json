{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A potentially excellent little camera........", "Author": "Scott Wimmer", "ReviewID": "RD5OMA6WMDM7H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After getting the unit set up for wireless use, I put it in position for monitoring. It took a while to figure out where all the menus were located for setting it up to record on alarm etc. etc. The instructions the camera come with deal with setting up the viewing on istuff, Android, and PC and network setup, not much else.The Good - I will say that the video quality I get from this camera is a lot better than what I got from the Tenvis iprobot3. When I bought this camera, I also bought two of the iprobot 3's thinking they would be the superior camera's. Boy was I wrong. I sent them both back to Amazon for refund. I left a review for Tenvis so I won't get in to that here. I also tested the audio feature that allows talking into and receiving sound back from the camera and it sounded good to me. I thought it would be very tinny but actually sounds clear and good and is loud. It takes photos, as many as you want, and records a video on motion alerts and saves them on your computer wirelessly. That part is outstanding, I just wonder if it can still send those recordings to you if you are off your home network? I will update when I get the chance to find out. The P/T function of this camera works slow but it works.The Bad - This camera has the potential to be a lot better with hopefully a few firmware updates. When I use the Android app and log in to view the camera, it constantly tells me there is a motion alarm. This is very frustrating as one of the reasons I wanted this camera was to alert me when it detected motion. There is absolutely no information in the package or online that I can find that tells you how to set this thing up for recording options. There is a motion sensor setting from 1 to 10 but I still do not know whether 1 or 10 is the most sensitive as the camera alarms on any setting with no motion. The Z function I left out above is because I have yet to get the camera to zoom. I cannot do it from the PC nor from my Android phone. You cannot adjust any of the camera settings on Android with the eyesee app., except P/T and sound. You need a PC for anything else. Not sure about the istuff apps yet.Anyway, I hope the folks at Geeya see this review and try to fix these issues and make some directions for the settings. I would gladly adjust my rating up 1 star if they could address the motion issue.UPDATE**** Ok, I set up the software on my ipad2 and here is where I found the ability to adjust the brightness and contrast as well as save locations of interest or predesignated camera positions. These options are not available from the PC or from my Android phone. I think GEEYA needs to make all features available on all devices for this to be a better device. I still have not figured out this motion alert yet. I get the images and video in time stamped files but there is nothing there when I view them, by nothing I mean nothing that moved. Whenever I go in front of the camera to test the motion, the log that eventually pops up does not have me anywhere in it. It's as though it alarmed for motion but didn't start recording anything until I walked away. I will test this theory later. Still the video quality even in IR mode is outstanding in my opinion compared to the Tenvis iprobot 3.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent daytime picture quality - not good nighttime", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R26QXPR6ZRFHKJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pro: The picture in good light is very clear, outstanding  infact.  Movement of the PTZ is graded and has a wide field.  The app (iphone/Android) works out of the box with no weird router port forwarding or setup nightmare - it even allows you to scan the QR code on the base to save you having to enter a device ID.Con: the IR LEDs are not powerful enough to warrant night viewing.  Other cameras do this better.  The manual is OK, but there is little information about how to use the camera with other software (like a browser, BlueIris or similar software).  It would help if the mobile app showed you the IP address and port for a browser in some way, as discovering that is hard work for most people.BTW - default port it uses to gain access for the web interface is 81, so you would need to use something like 192.168.1.10:81 in a browser to view that screen.  Of course, your IP address will vary.Summary: good camera for daytime viewing, and as with most clones like this, needs a better manual.  For the sake of hiring a document writer *once*, these companies would avoid the same complaints on these forums.
