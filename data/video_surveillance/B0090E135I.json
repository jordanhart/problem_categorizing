The reason for the 4 star is the DVR operating system. I should be able to back up the recordings as the manual says but couldn't. It doesn\u2019t recognize external hard drives and couldn\u2019t see the flash drive either when a mouse is plugged in. Viewing recorded video is not so easy to get to. You have to click on View Logs, put down the date and time and hit search. In a minute or two you'll have logs for each camera. It is then that you can play video of each separate camera. I have not found any easier way to backup or view so far.The DVR can handle better cameras but not HD. Bought an additional 700TVL camera and it does better at night than the ones in the package.If you plan to install at a business with good lighting, it is pretty decent. Night recording is ok but again you are not going to recognize people\u2019s faces very well.All in all it is worth it for the price range and what it is designed for. Sure I recommend it for general use like around home or a small business especially for day time monitoring. For night time the cams get a good range but clarity is not best.If you can afford ~$2000 system go for the full 1080 with RG45 cabling.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Effective", "Author": "Victor Miguel Saraiva Tomczak", "ReviewID": "R151EFE3S8XQLX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This set have the basic for my surveillance needs.
