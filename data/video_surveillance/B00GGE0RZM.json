{"Reviews": [], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Key ring Sized: At only 1.75 x 0.75 x 0.4 inches, the SpyDrive is impressively small for all its capabilities. With a key ring attachment built in, the SpyDrive can go with you anywhere, ready to record whenever you need it. It's sturdy and shock resistant, and its pinhole camera doesn't have any easily scratched lenses that require special care.\nBuilt for Efficiency: The built-in lithium battery gets a full charge in just 2 hours and remains ready to record for weeks in standby mode. It can take lots of small bursts of footage or record for up to an hour nonstop on a single charge. Plus, you don't need to turn the SpyDrive off after recording; after 1 minute in standby, it powers down automatically to conserve battery life.\nMonitor Employees and Guard Your Belongings: The SpyDrive will look like part of the scenery hanging out of the USB port on your computer, so you can leave it to record for seconds, minutes, or hours at a time, catching anybody who might poke through your things while you're away from your desk. Add security to your office, your home, and everywhere in between.\nA Resourceful Gadget: The easy quick-flip design lets you flick open the lid, press to power, and start recording instantly. Appearing as an innocuous thumb drive, it's much more subtle than using a smartphone or video camera. Subjects will never suspect they're being filmed. Great for Private Investigators on the case, Bounty Hunters tracking a criminal, teens seeking proof of bullying, or added personal protection for anybody who needs it.\nCompatible with Mac & Windows: Uploading and watching the footage from the SpyDrive is as easy as operating the camera. Just hook it up to the computer and upload the .AVI videos. It's compatible with Mac and Windows and easily uploads into any program.", "Name": "Mini Rechargeable Spy Camera with Flash Drive Hidden Surveillance DVR", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31-TNmN3txL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00GGE0RZM"}}
