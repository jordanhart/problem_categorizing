{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very good system in its price range", "Author": "Philossifer \"Phil\"", "ReviewID": "RKO9JOQDP6WZJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This system is very easy to set-up because of the single wire camera runs. The cables are 60' long and they supply power, audio and video. Networking is extremely easy; I can view my camera's live from anywhere with a computer (connected to the internet) or with my iPhone.  The mobile app for the iPhone is awesome!  I did have to contact tech support at Revo to open up some ports on my router. That was quick, easy and the tech support guy was very friendly.  He actually took over my computer and did the set up from his end.  One short 10 minute call and I was up and running in no time.I also purchased four extra cameras and a back-up power supply to keep things going during a power outage or brownout.The camera's aren't the best, but for the money I spent on this system, they more than sufficient.  The night vision is very clear too. The cameras that come with this system have a 33 foot night vision range, two of the extra cameras I bought were for 80 foot night vision; those are to cover my front and back yard.On the downside, you can only record and monitor audio on the first eight cameras, but that's an easy work around because there are certain area's in the house you don't need to monitor or record audio.The DVR has a lot of features that I haven't even tapped into yet, like push notifications and email alerts.  Revo also makes cameras that you can pan and zoom but they are quite pricey.  In total, the DVR has 16 camera input, 12 of them are for the REVO single wire cameras, and then they also give you 4 BNC inputs for the standard type security cameras. (but with those you have to run separate wires for video, power and audio)You can't go wrong with this system. It's relatively inexpensive, comes with everything you need to get it up and running quickly and the video quality is very good.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$949.99", "Features": "Connection type: 12 RJ12 and 4 BNC ports\nView and access live and recorded video remotely over the internet or mobile phone\nCameras lens: 3.6mm\nHard Drive: 2TB\nCameras have a built in microphone for audio monitoring capability", "Name": "Revo R164D4FB4F-2T 16-Channel 2TB DVR Surveillance System with 8 600TVL Cameras (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31yOxMBzWJL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008DHDQIK"}}
