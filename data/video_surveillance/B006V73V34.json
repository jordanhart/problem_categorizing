For $30 I was a bit skeptical of the quality of the video. Be warned that this specific product DOES NOT record sound. A minor setback considering on the box packaged in, the otherwise was stated.

I would rate this a zero if that was an option.  This product is absolutely worthless. I think if I was the vendor I would be embarrased to sell this product.  Packaging looked professional, and so I was hoping that this thing would at least work some of the time.  First clue of trouble was the camera pictured on the packaging did not match what was inside.  Camera gets \"hot\", quickly as described by other reviewers; much warmer than a thermal handwarmer.  The image is litterally washed out short of making out some basic details, and yes I followed the instructions to focus the receiving unit and the lens on the camera.  The system basically worked except that the quality of the image was so poor it renders the whole setup worthless.  Thank goodness for Amazons accomodating return policy, otherwise just flush $20 bucks and you will get about the same amount of satisfaction.  Do not buy or you too will be writing a review like this.  To bad though, I was really hoping this would work.  I guess I am going to have to spend more money to get a working system next time, and no I am not a competing vendor.  Just someone who hoped this would work and trying to save someone else from having to return this product.", "Date": "November 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Had to return", "Author": "Shelli", "ReviewID": "R3NDQM6YXNZY9Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very professional company that responds quickly. I had to return this product. I could not get it to work and I do not know if it was due to our Att Uverse connection (fiber optics), by abilities in hooking it up or the product itself.
