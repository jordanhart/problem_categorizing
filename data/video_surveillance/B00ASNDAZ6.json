{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Image Quality", "Author": "CDR", "ReviewID": "R11WCDO625AW4N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am quite impressed with the picture this produces. It is better at low-light than the other covert cameras I have installed for clients. It does NOT do no-light. I have tried IR spotlights, but they just dont help enough. It is tiny & solid. The connector is a tiny 3-wire push in type. The client needed this installed INSIDE a ceiling fan. I had to cut off adapter cable and splice CAT3 phone wires to it so it would feed through fan core. Quality is still good after 15' of phone wire, then 25' of CAT5 network cable, before the final splice back onto factory pigtail adapter cable. In my opinion, that is asking alot of this item and I am very pleased with the result.", "Date": "September 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00ASNDAZ6"}}
