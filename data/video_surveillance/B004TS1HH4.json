{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome system for the price!", "Author": "Josh", "ReviewID": "R25CCOD1O3RT79", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I bought this system based upon price, and a few other reviews. We've been having some vandalism in our area recently, and if something was going to happen to me, I was going to be ready and catch this hoodlum! I installed all 8 cameras and the DVR in just one Saturday. (wires ran down the wall and everything). The color quality isn't perfect, for example, the green's look a little purple; but still do-able. The DVR interface is easy to use, the manual on the other hand wasn't written very well, topics jump all over the book. I had to use YouTube to find out how to do a lot of stuff because the manual just didn't make a lot of sense. Anyway- DVR easy to use, everything, easy to install, video quality- pretty good, Night vision quality- pretty good. NOTE though: for areas like a small deck or patio, small front porch the cameras illuminate these area's very well, you can see fine; however, if you want to see in the dark with these cameras covering your yard, you will need a IR illuminator to light up the area so the cameras can see in the dark.Overall- I highly recommend the product for a small business, or home owner who wants to watch their property. You can't beat the features, quality for the price.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "cameras are great...instructions stink", "Author": "remo", "ReviewID": "RQ57ONOBAZ5PZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "the system is pretty awesome.  camera placement was real easy. the mounts are super lightweight and the cameras are easy to install. with a jacket that has a lot of pockets and a drill attachment that slides over the mounting screw heads to hold them in place, being high up on a ladder's a cinch.  the cables are really easy to plug together and if you're using a regular monitor, the dvr is super user friendly.....Now for the cons: you might as well throw out the instructions for internet viewing...they are basically in another language with the horrible English.  I have two words for the ZModo people...SPELL CHECK...Anyway, I went on youtube and found some standard DVR Remote Viewing instructional videos and with a little playing around it was successful.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good product for its value", "Author": "R.R \"iLuvSeafood\"", "ReviewID": "R3BYLX2YVJLUJO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I Received zmodo 8 channel camera quickly from wennow. Amazon shipping took too long. I did a lot of research around and finally decided on this security camera system because it has 4+ star rating. The previous reviews were positive about this product. The setup is easy and it is ready to be used out of the box. For 8 camera system, 300 dollars are very good price, compare to the same system which will cost around 600 dollars.  I installed this system in my little shop. The camera quality is good, works ok during the day. The camera works best when the object of recording is within 5 to 10 feet range in a bright setting. It is not that clear for anything 20 feet away. Maybe the outline of the object is clear but you will not be able to tell the license plate number more than 20 feet. The night vision works better if a illuminating light source is used at the same time. For the price of this system, the image quality is acceptable. This system can be used as baby monitor. For its value, it can beat other baby monitor products valued at 200 dollars.  I will give is system 5 stars only if the network setup can be easier. The system didn't have detailed network setup instruction. The Manuel contain little information on how to use this system. It is very difficult to setup the network if you just looking at the Manuel and doing tons of research online. For beginners if you like to view your camera from you computer over the same network, you need to install the software from the small disc and do the ip configuration too. There is a more detailed instruction from YouTube which tells you how to setup the network locally. I gave up the wireless network setup because it is beyond the ability of a college graduate. There is no instruction on that anywhere in the package.  Anyway, it is a good system for its value and the network setup instruction sucks!", "Date": "May 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "So Far So Good", "Author": "Jamie", "ReviewID": "R2XLOO89PVYQAX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This product was promptly delivered.

It was easy to set up, the video quality is good, and I'm really impressed with the software that allows me to watch and review over the internet or even my Iphone.

Camera's are a little cheap but surprisingly give decent color after adjusting hue and saturation.Connecting to my network was easy but I'm having problems with the web display.  Internet explorer will not connect consistently, and the downloaded software will not connect at all.I spent over an hour on  chat with tech support in China.  The guy was very patient and helpful and even spoke better English than some of my friends.If you are looking for great quality video, this is not the system for you.  If you want decent video and the peace of mind security, then this will do the trick.Update - After playing with the video format in teh DVR software I was able to get the LIVE feed of the video working.

However, this is not true outside.I tested the night vision inside, and it seemed to work pretty well.However, after mounting the cameras high on the sides of the house, the cameras see nothing but black at night. The images are 100% black and no shapes are visible.Note: We live in the country, and there are no \"city\" lights to help with night vision.The plastic thumb screws break off easily, and then you have to use needle nose pliers to tighten the screws in place to mount the camera arm.The DVR only allows one camera to be in D1 recording mode.It only allows one camera in HD2 mode, too.Bottom line... This system is generally bad all around and I will likely be returning it soon.UPDATE 08/12/2012:After returning this system, I purchased a Swann security system. The Swann is a much better system and I highly recommend it over the Zmodo.

He and another worker had it set up and running within 4 hours.  He had a theft a few months after the installation.  The police officer that came in to review the video said there was no hard drive in the unit.  We ended up taking the DVR apart and never found a hard drive.  There was no external hard drive in the packaging either.  Well, needless to say I call Zmodo because I had waited too long to get service through amazon.  The folks with Zmodo support kindly told me that it was not their problem - even thought the SKU I ordered through amazon was the one that said it included the 500GB Hard Drive.  I provided receipts and everything they asked for but never got the issue resolved with Zmodo customer service.  They suggested I return the entire package to amazon.  First of all it was a gift and my brother and a co-worker spent half a day wiring and installing the new system.  I finally had him go out and buy an external hard drive to connect to the system and it is now recording successfully.  Maybe amazon is a little responsible and maybe I am for not following up sooner. Zmodo should provide better customer support.  The quality of the video is pretty good and the system seems fairly easy to navigate.  I was able to set up web and remote viewing without incident but I am not a fan of the customer support at Zmodo as I was cheated out of a hard drive that should have came with the system.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed", "Author": "viettq", "ReviewID": "R1P0W4SG46A1AD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I ordered this system to replace for 5 year old system in my business ( but still working).
