Not worth the money you'll pay for it. Once I finally decoded how to turn it on and off, I went to plug hte USB connector in to my PC for the second time and the USB connector had receded into the plastic case so far that I could not plug it in to download my test video. It is now loose and floating around inside the thermometer. After 5 minutes of playing operation with a paper clip, I got it back in place, but it again receded into the body as soon as I tried to plug the USB cable into it. What a WASTE of money! If I could rate it ZERO. I would, because it is of Zero use to me without the ability to actually see what gets recorded.", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "need good light source", "Author": "t", "ReviewID": "R31R67QSQZ2I6A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "this item does work. the instructions are kind of hard to understand. i will rephrase them for u a bit. to turn on- press A for 3 seconds, you will get a long red light (its now in stand-by mode). to activate camera to record constantly: press B for 3 seconds, red light will flash 2 times then go off (now its recording). to stop recording: press B once and quickly press A while the light is flashing(the light will flash 2 times when pressing B and 4 times when pressing A).
