So I expected something similar when I bought these cables. When they arrived, I was a bit disappointed that they were thinner than the free cables I got with my CIB System. To give you an idea, these cables are thinner than the cable on my cheap computer mouse. But I figured they would be OK since the reviews were so good & that they would be easy to hide since they are so thin.Before I even unwound the cables, I plugged in a camera & power to each one to test them. The 1st cable had excessive static/interference, the 2nd cable had good video but the power did not work, the 3rd cable had no video, but the power worked & the 4th cable worked OK. I even tried each cable again with a different camera & power adapter to be sure the cables were the problem since I could not believe 3 out of 4 were bad.With 3 out of 4 cables being bad, I am just returning them & will look for something else. I would not buy these cables again even if they cost half of what I paid. The only positive thing I can say is that these cables came with 8 BNC Female to RCA Male adapters.", "Date": "February 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good cable", "Author": "Phil Monson", "ReviewID": "REDOMKHYNT4Y8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price, and the quality, a good deal, been installed for awhile now, have not had any problems at all", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Does exactly what it supposed to do, but wires wrapped in an absurd fashion", "Author": "Jared", "ReviewID": "R3ONIQW8XTAK4X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "These wires worked exactly as they were supposed to with no defects found during my installation.However, the way the wires were wrapped was crazy. They immediately become a rat's nest of knots when you begin to unravel them. I found this out too late: while in the attic. It added at least 30 or more minutes to my install and made for lots of frustration. Partially my fault for not doing this on the ground before hand, but still, why the heck would the packager wrap them in this way?Result: Does the job that you're probably looking to do, but make sure you spend the time unraveling them before you begin the install or you might go insane.", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Inexpensive cables for my home security cameras.", "Author": "Fireballsocal", "ReviewID": "RUP0XQ4LOGWEP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These are installed on my swann 16 channel 8 camera home security camera system right alongside the standard cables that came with the set. I see no difference in picture quality between the 2. This is a perfectly acceptable cable set for not alot of money. The only difference I can see is that you really need to muscle the spring loaded ends on. Push hard, much harder then the standard swann cables and they will slide on, then you can twist them to lock. I would definitely recommend them as well as buy them again.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor quality: thin wire, minimal insulation, and bad connectors", "Author": "a_reviewer", "ReviewID": "RKQ5H3HJMAMNU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "These cables use extremely small power conductors (probably around 22 or 24 AWG) over a very long run.  To give you an idea of the difference between these and higher-quality cables, the entire package of 4 cables takes up the same space as one 100' 75ohm Swann cable.  Accordingly, the cable has minimal insulation / protection and if you were to drag it across any sharp edges during installation, it may be the end of the cable.  The worst part is the connector quality.  The DC power connectors are supposed to be the somewhat standard 5.5mm x 2.1mm barrels; however, there was so much variation that some ends would fit snugly and others would virtually fall off.  Due to the poor tolerances, power to the cameras was intermittent and the ends had to be adjusted any time the cables were bumped.  Fortunately, I discovered this before running them, and hopefully you'll read this before buying them.  As indicated, the Swann are far better quality if you require a pre-made cable.  Otherwise, I'd recommend buying high-quality 75-ohm siamese cable, BNC connectors, and power pigtails and making your own cables to fit your install.", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Its perfect.", "Author": "J.
