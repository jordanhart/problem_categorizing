{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A dud", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R3221FC57ESIJG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This unit was purchased as I was replacing a Zmodo H9128V that had only CIF recording.  I bought this after asking Amazon about a user manual and technical support, which they could not provide.  They assured me it was supported, so I ordered it.  Amazon backs their offerings, so here we go.  I have been in electronics my life, so sort of know a tad about these things, and I promise this review is objective.  I am not affiliated with any company or product, but I am a homeowner trying to get my home system up and running.At first glance, the vivid screens, and numerous selections were impressive.  The box arrives with all advertised accessories, and is nicely boxed and shipped.  Came in one day!  So I installed everything up then I got right into the video adjustment and recording setup.  I attempted to read thru the user manual, but it is very basic and obviously re-written in English.  With very little manual instructions, I set up the alarm recording modes out of my own 25 year electronic background knowledge base.  If you are a novice, and/or are not versed in video surveillance, this unit will not suit you as it has no suitable procedures to address the numerous selections on the setup.I attempted to set up a motion alarm type recording.  The recording delay is stuck on 10 seconds??  Now who wants to record motion, but wait ten whole seconds for the recording to begin?  DUH!  There is a window to change it to a more useable delay time such as (1 second), but when you attempt to save it, it reverts back to 10 seconds and overrides your selection (unacceptable).  A couple of my test motion recordings revealed nothing on the recording because the 10 second delay didn't allow recording until our test object (a person) came and left the camera objective area.  There is a pre-record function, but although set several different ways, it obviously does not work.  I even set pre-record to ten seconds to match the ten second delay, hoping to get an accurate and timely recording, but it still recorded nothing in so far as detected motion is concerned.  I then determined that motion recordign onn this devise is useless. (again, unacceptable)Next is the user manual, which in my opinion will only tick you off when you attempt to read and use it to get this unit up and running.  When you see that it barely covers the highlights of the unit, and nowhere does it address the alarm delay and pre-record functions, or any other technical setup matter, you will agree.  Regardless, the manual has no substance and is obviously re-written in English to sell the box.  (unacceptable)I never got to the network or web access setup, so I won't speak to that.  I never made it thru basic recording function setup before it was boxed up and a all tag stuck on it.Technical support??  When I called Amazon to request technical support, they offered me a number, but when I could not get a phone to answer, they attempted to call the supplier, but even they were hung up on when the number dialed answered.  They then gave me an email address for customer support that I am standing by for an answer now for several days.  (unacceptable)If you buy this, good luck.  I sent it back without further thought. Thank you Amazon for your support, but you might want to ask these sellers to advertise more accurately and support their products.", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GIAIWFQ"}}
