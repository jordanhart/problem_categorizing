I put this big antenna on the camera and it works a lot better now. Instant response and no buffering.The antenna is big, and looks a little goofy on my camera, but the increase in performance is worth it. A nice, easy, and inexpensive solution. Much better, and way cheaper, than buying and installing an amplifier or wireless range extender.I'd recommend this antenna for use in situations where you can communicate with your camera, but the picture and movement don't work well.If you are not even able to communicate with your camera, then a passive antenna my not improve things much.

It looks a bit weird attached to the camera because it is long, But as far as I can tell it works pretty good. I have some Foscam FI8910 W cameras. I set one up in a steel pole barn with a fiberglass garage door. I couldn't get it to couple with my router in the house with the standard antenna. I put this antenna on and bingo it connected right away. I don't think it can punch through steel and the fiberglass door helps I'm sure, but still, the standard antenna wouldn't get there and this one does. I can't speak to how far it will extend the range and there are a lot of factors that can impact that, but I am convinced that it will get you farther than the standard antenna.I plan on trying some experimenting this coming Summer with an outdoor camera to see just how far it will extend the range line of sight.I will just add that among the various factors that can impact wireless range, other wireless traffic in the area can be the biggest one to cause problems. Sometimes different channels work better than others. This antenna will not solve all problems by any means, but it should help. Whether or not it is enough can not be predicted reliably. Your specific set of conditions means a lot. Sometimes you can also get high gain antennas for your router too. These might even fit depending on the connector.

Boy, was I wrong. As metioned, this unit DOES NOT FIT the FI8906 without modifications. You must grind down the outer surface of the device so that it will fit and properly tighten into the camera. However, after modified, the inner threads came unglued out of the antenna. JB Weld fixed that problem with great care not to interfere with connection/conductivity. With the device ready, it was attached and absolutely no visible improvement was noted. Maybe parameters on signal quality read on my base station were slightly better\u2014I went from -81dB to -79dB. But no reception/transmission difference.

If you have a indoor Foscam, and you are spending the time worrying about signal strength, and you have invested your time, money, and wishes on the cameras, just get these antennae for EVERY one of your cams. Here's why:Unless the Foscam is in the same room as the router, an IP cam puts a lot of strain on your WiFi. Unlike web pages or email, a cam streams video, video is high bandwidth, and if you're storing your video on a PC (usin Blue Iris software, for example) the cam is streaming 24x7. Add a few more cams, and that's a lot of bandwidth.As your wifi channel becomes slightly congested, and your signal strength is not ideal, the cameras start dropping data packets, and trying to re-send, and then conflicting with the other cameras which all want to send their video NOW! Stronger signal avoids the lost packets and the resends. Use these, or even better, run Ethernet cable. You won't believe how much better the cameras work on Ethernet.By running all upgraded antennae, you will get better framerates from all cams, more reliable connections, the ability to have more cams on the same wifi network, fewer crashes, fewer bugs, faster PTZ response, etc. That's true even if your system works just fine with the shorties.Here's the downside, which is manageable: these antennas aren't magic. They don't make your signal stronger, they just change the aim of the signal. With the shorter stock 3dbi pole antenna, picture a big donut around the tip of the antenna. That is where your signal goes. Now, with this longer 9dbi pole antenna, picture a flat pancake around the tip of the antenna. That is where your signal goes with this unit. That means you have to aim the antenna in such a way that the wifi AP is on a plane perpendicular to the antenna. If your Foscam is one floor above your WiFi, this antenna will make your signal WORSE if you keep the antenna straight up, and don't \"aim the pancake\".", "Date": "April 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Antennae very loose", "Author": "Eric D.
