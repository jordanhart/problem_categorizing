{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome camera!", "Author": "Kevin J. Lang \"Hard Nose Jerk\"", "ReviewID": "RI88P2688DNPP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:- Decent pivoting on camera (very decent range of movement)- sharp picture (though you have to focus manually on the camera)- pretty easy to setup if you are technically inclined- lots of features like motion detection with emailing and ftp, video recording, etc.- Night vision works perfectly; integrated controls for 4 cameras.Cons:- You do need to be technically savvy to set this up. There is very little documentation on how to do this. But it is very obvious how to do it if you are in the field. There is no GUI wizard to help set this up.- No zoom- When camera is using night vision you see a ring of red dots around the lens. So hiding can be a challenge.- No SSL or encryption options. The web controls for this thing runs on HTTP. So capturing packets and seeing your passwords is very easy. So security is kind of an issue.- I'm not sure about any support (Hardware, software, replacements, etc) because I haven't had to use it. But looking at this I have no idea who I would contact.- Firmware updates - There is no option for the camera to go out and discover firmware updates. So you have to search for them your self.- For some reason I needed to factory reset the camera to start using it when I received it. Not too much of a con but it made me think that this was refurbished or something.Honestly, this camera being around $99 and having all the features that it does is pretty awesome. Other cameras with only half of option this has costs about $250-300ish. This camera looks like something that someone created, sold to a bunch of other companies (who just stamp their name on the front), and they are the ones who provide support for it. So you can get updates from them even if you didn't buy the camera from them.For the money it's a great camera. It's not perfect but I'm certainly not going to spend $300 on one like this.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wansview NC541/W", "Author": "CP44", "ReviewID": "RN2S89A5UY89B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered 2 of the \"Wireless IP Pan/Tilt/ Night Vision/ Internet Surveillance Camera Built-in Microphone With Phone remote monitoring support\" cameras from ATC LLC and received 2 \"Wansview NC541/W\" IP cameras.  They were as they appeared in the pictures, and featured internal web servers with configuration options and settings that seem to be shared by similar IP cameras.  The box and web-based control interface did not match the pictures, but were fine.  The motion detection seemed a little weak; would recommend \"MJPEG Surveillance 2.0\" at 12oClocker.com to handle motion detection and recording, but the actual camera features are fine - if a little hard to find.  The cameras I received support up to 8 users with different passwords and 3 access ranks (view-only \"Visitor\", pitch/pan \"Operator\", full \"Administrator\"), changing the HTTP server port, static and dynamic IPs, wireless with security off or on (WEP, WPA-TKIP, WPA-AES, WPA2-TKIP, WPA-AES), and turning off the blinking status light.  There are also different viewer and control pages for Internet Explorer (ActiveX), FireFox and other supporting ServerPush, and mobile viewers.  The IE/ActiveX web page and the included IPCMonitor software (also downloadable from Wansview) support listening to the camera's microphone and talking through speakers plugged into the camera's Audio jack.Warnings:The colors do not seem to be quite right, even after adjusting brightness and contrast.  There is no zoom function, but the outer lens is manually adjustable for focusing (twist the ring).  It is possible to unscrew the focus ring/tube until it falls out - I say normal users should avoid doing that.  (I did it to add a black ring to block the infrared LEDs - long story).  The IR LEDs do not seem to have a \"disable\" function and are controlled by ambient light on a photocell.I would highly recommend this camera if you can get this exact model.  A problem with having the brand name unlisted is that stocking companies may consider similar/rebranded cameras all interchangeable.  My research leads me to believe that their design and web server software are mostly the same, with each company changing as much as they want to and re-marketing the product.

I've tested it with both sunlight, artificial light, and nighttime and the camera adjusts very well for all settings, and tweaking the brightness can hep a lot. The controls are very smoth and the speed it adjustable, it can move as quick as ~270\u00b0 in 3 seconds or set to fine control that operates it in very small and accurate adjustments. The is no freedom of play in the parts, and the motors are very smooth and precise.Got mine set up in 30 minutes (Opening box, setup, mounting) and I'm now about to order a second shipment of 2. These are perfect and high quality cameras for the low-budget surveillance needs, as they can be up to (I believe) 16 cameras in synch. They have their own customizable IP configurations or has auto select options, and upnp.Very good, quality product and amazing price. 5/5Pros:Accurate and smooth PT mechanism.Very good camera and IR.RJ-45 Network interface for direct network attachmentFree Multi-camera software included.Cameras are compatible with more then 1 in the same network.At night the IR LED's look like GLADoS' cameras with a luminesent red glow around the lens.Camera controls are moderately hard to set up but most could accomplish it.Documentation is included (on a micro-cd)Camera has embeded alarm hookups (4 pin)Camera has external port for external speakerOnce you have it setup, viewing from inside your LAN/WAN and over the Internet is very easyThe cons:You have to know how to do basic port forwarding on your router to get the wifi working.Initially using the RJ-45 and included disc you can use it instantly and use (through the camera control's) to setup your wireless.Wireless WEP/WEP2 Mixed Wifi Password types were not compatable (However a quick switch to WEP2 Personal fixed this).The audio controls are touchy at best and I could not get it to work properly.

This is done as a \"convenience\" so you can go to an address and watch your Camera from anywhere in the world but if you ask me it has the opportunity to become a huge invasion of privacy. I do not want some company in China to be able to PTZ (and listen BTW) around my house. Thinking there has to be a way to disable this I took the Camera to the IT department at work. They confirmed the feature is not able to be disabled but the viewing of the Camera image can be password protected. I have no confidence that the manufacture can\u2019t just bypass this since the camera frequently \u201ccalls home\u201d.

Setup is a little confuse with included manual but after reading it carefully it should be no brainer.Here is step how to setup your IP camera:1. Plug camera to your router with network cable included (DO NOT USE WIFI for initial setup).2. Factory setting for this IP camera is static and they set it as 192.168.0.178. So if your router IP look like this 192.168.1.xxx (usually linksys) it will not pickup the camera on the software included cd or web browser. So this mean you need to change your router ip to 192.168.0.x subnet (if you don't know how call the router manufacture tech support or google it).3. Once your router is set to the above ip (192.168.0.x) and the ip cam is connected, open your browser and type in 192.168.0.178 it should pop up with a username / password screen, here what you will type in for username: admin / password: 123456 after successfully log on changes whatever needed IP to your existing subnet.4. To view it from WAN side meaning from work, iphone bla..bla.....you need to create a free account with (dyndns dot org) or use the camera factory provided.5. If you use factory dyndns skip this part. Once DYNDNS is setup go in to Network tab in camera setting and put in your info Host name: xxx.dyndns(dot)org and put in the port default is 80.6. Now log in to your router and find PORT FORWARDING option, should be burried in one of the tab menu. Type in the camera ip this case it is (192.168.0.178) for mine which is factory default and where it read TCP/IP put in 80 for port and make sure you check the box next on the menu of your router or click on apply to save all changes before closing them.Now take a coffee break after all the hard work you just did and give dyndns few minutes to register your IP with internet DNS. To access your WAN view just open up your browser I suggest Mozzila firefox brower and type in xxx.dyndns(dot)org and that it you're done.For Iphone apps they recommended LIVE CAMS.", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the money!", "Author": "M. Morales", "ReviewID": "R2ELZCYCF1UOK3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "These are a great deal for $60!  I agree with all the positive things the other reviewers have written. You get COLOR, wireless, pan and tilt, infrared (works in pitch black), two way sound, motion detection and 30 frames per minute video plus a bunch of notification options.  Once you have them set-up accessing them from the internet with PC using IE or an Android phone is super simple.  I hooked up two of them last night and I'm really pleased with the value.  One of the posters below said they were only black and white.  That is not true, I get color when the light is sufficient.  They switch to black and white when it's really dark and they begin using the infrared spectrum.My only concern and the reason that I knocked off one star (would have given them five), is that the instructions and setup software are confusing.  The setup software works fine, but it's difficult to understand the interface and some of the translation is funky.  The same is true of the instruction manual.  I've included some tips below for those familiar with networking.TIPS: Generally, be aware that camera will reboot after some operations and it takes about a minute, so be patient. Also, after changing some settings you have to exit your browser and then go back in to re-establish the connection to the camera. Make sure to press the \"SET\" and/or \"APPLY\" buttons after you make changes.Getting started:Put the included disk in and use the IPCAM Finder program in ADVANCED mode to set the IP address and port number of the cam(s) first, USING A CONNECTED NETWORK CABLE, then once you have the IP set, point to the address with your browser and the port number you set (like 192.168.1.XXX:81) then USE THE BROWSER BASED INTERFACE to set up everything else (like the wireless settings and passwords.) Once you've got the wireless setup up you can disconnect the network cable then disconnect the power cable and reconnect, that should put the cam online wirelessly.You need to make sure you set the cams up with static IPs in you home network or you may not be to access them from the outside after their DHCP lease expires. Don't choose an IP that is within your DHCP range and don't let the cam use DHCP to get it's address.On my own setup I had to forward port 81 and port 82 in my router to my two cameras (obviously you have to set up each with with a different IP and port number during setup) because I wanted to hit them from outside my home network.When you scan for networks in the wireless setup sometimes you have to click SCAN two times for it to list them. Once you have the list you just click on your home network and set the shared key (wireless password).If you don't have a static IP, go out to the web and sign-up with dyndns then you can use a URL to get to them from the outside. For my two cameras it's like URL = \"myowndomain.dyndns.info:81\" (or 82 depending on which cam I want to use.) My router is capable of updating the DNS server at DYNDNS without a client installed on my PCs. If your router can't do that you'll need to install the update client from DYNDNS on your PC.Once you have the cameras all setup accessing them is simple from Android phone or IE browser. I tried FireFox on my Linux netbook and it works fine too.The software and manual are a little funky and some of the translations are weird. For example: to turn off the green light in on the camera, you choose \"been extinguished\" in the drop down.There is a focus ring around the outside of the lens, you can adjust the focus with this if you need to, but mine came from the shipper with good focus.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "First one was a dud, second one works great", "Author": "M. Schmidt", "ReviewID": "R1MPCIVFYWSQSM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered one of these units from Amazon via a third part reseller.  It was DOA, although I think the problem was just a bad AC adapter.  Amazon once again exceeded my expectations for customer service, and got a replacement out to me right away.The second unit works great.  As other reviewers have said, the included instructions may as well have been written in Chinese for all the sense they made.  I picked up some hints from other reviews here, and also found some info on the web.I'll give a quick synopsis of how I set up the unit.  There are other ways to do it, but this was the easiest for me:1. Take a laptop or PC, hardcode the wired ethernet port to 192.168.0.177, netmask 255.255.255.0, gateway 192.168.0.178.2. Plug the laptop's ethernet cable and the camera's ethernet cable into a switch (or if you have an ethernet crossover cable you can string the laptop directly into the camera).3. Open a browser window (I used Firefox) and type 192.168.0.178 into the address bar.  This is the default network address of the camera.4. The camera will prompt you for username and pw (admin/123456 is the default).5. In the camera's wireless setup screen, hit the button to scan for wireless networks.  Select your wireless network and enter the security key.6. Back on the networking page, select the box to automatically get address (DHCP)7. There is a \"Save settings\" button which causes the camera to reboot.8. Unplug the ethernet cable from the camera.9. From your laptop/PC, open your wireless router's setup page.  You should see something that lists all connected clients.10. On my router, I selected the camera, and told the router to always assign the camera the same IP address.  This is called MAC address association on my router.  This lets me bookmark the camera and know it will always have the same address.11. Go to the camera's new address in your browser, and start watching the action.I haven't tried to set the camera up for viewing across the internet, so I can't comment on the capability.  That involves setting up dynamic DNS and opening ports on the router, etc.Night vision is excellent, if you're thinking about using this as a baby monitor.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent for the price", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R22LRSTQOJLY7W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are several points to be made here:ApplicationI have 9 of these camera's.  For what I'm using them for it would cost me several thousand dollars to use cameras designed for my application.  I turned them into POE type cameras so that I could mount them in remote location without a power source.  It took quite an effort and a lot of testing to get the voltage right, but after 3 months, I finally figured out how to do it.  They work awesome for the price.  Many cams are outside under my eves, and have been through several rain storms.  I'm in Southern California, so I would not recommend that application to anyone living in one of those super wet States.  They might not be able to handle the moisture.  Although, I could find a way around that too if I tried hard enough.I only use these to monitor things remotely over the internet. I do not use them to record video or setup motion detection zones.  The software is capable of doing that, but with 9 cameras on a simple LAN, they use too much bandwidth.  I have not gone as far as setting up subnets or a VLAN, as that would require extra hardware, and a ton of configuration.  I did, however, manage to stumble across the QoS settings in my router, and was able to get it to limit the bandwidth allocated to my cameras.  It works fairly well.  The other thing is that to record motion video, you have to leave a client application running, which continually suck up bandwidth.  So I just use the on board motion detection, and I have the cameras send me emails.  This works fairly  well.I had to setup 2 extra wireless routers to broadcast an acceptable signal for ALL 9 cameras.  It took me a couple of weeks to figure out it was a signal issue.  The more cameras you have, the greater the possibility of interference between cameras, so I had to setup multiple routers, use different channels, and set those routers at slower speeds to get everything to an acceptable rate.Quality vs CostI've tried a few other brands, and the picture quality was not as good.  These are by no means HD cameras, and you have to accept the limits of what you pay for, but guys with $800 cameras comment on the picture quality.  Personally, I'd like a little better quality, but I'm too cheap to pay for it.SoftwareThe GoodAmazingly enough, the free Client software, and the web server software are not too bad.  I tried out at least a dozen other Cam software application, including the top 3 commercial applications.  I was not impressed by any of them.  In fact, for what I am doing, they were worse.  If you need to define motion zones, and do true security, then there are better apps out there, but the included apps are not too bad.You have to play with the brightness and contract controls, as well as the PTZ and motion sensitively to dial it in, but they all work to some extent.  You can set the PTZ speed to super fast, so when you spin the cam, it can move 180 degrees in less than 3 seconds.  You can also set it so slow that it is annoying.  In any case, when moving the cam, the image will not be clear or jitter free.One of the nice things I found when suing the client software, is that if you have multiple PC's you want to use it on, you can configure all of your cams on one PC, and the copy the settings file to the other PC's so you don't have to do set up all over again.  Of course this is not documented, I just took a stab at it to see if it would work.The Not So GoodThe software does need work.  When the cams are mounted upside down, and you select flip and mirror, the client software controls for PTZ are reversed.  They do not operate properly.  With 9 cams running, any type of setting changes or PTZ activity takes forever.  Just way to much bandwidth required to stream 9 cams, and then expect to be able to send commands over the same connection, even when setting the FPS to as low as 1.  I've decided when I want to see all cams and view the big picture, I use the client software.  When I actually want to control the cam, I use the imbedded web server.  Neither the web server app, or the client apps, are top notch.  Portions of the page can display bigger than your monitor.  But I've seen worse on commercial software)Motion sensitivity is terrible.  You can't really adjust or fine tune them.  All you can really do is adjust the speed at which they will recognize motion.  If you set them too low, nothing will get capture ever.  One notch above that is too high.  Clouds set them off, lights set them off, heat sets them off, darkness and contrast set them off (EX  I have one pointed at a huge section of concrete.  The camera is not able to auto-adjust to the light.  So all it does is lighten and darken the image, continually attempting to find the correct setting.  I've swapped several cams into that position, and they have the same issue).SupportAbsolute ignorance.  These folks are in China.  They barely speak English, their manuals are terrible, and they do not understand much of anything about troubleshooting.  Here, you may be on your own if you get more complicated than plugging the cam in.  But with all of these types of cameras, I expect they are all made in the same factory in China, and they all have the same support issues.ConclusionsVery acceptable for the price of 9 cameras.  I would be pissed if I paid $3,000 and had the same issue I have with these.  But I am willing to accept the issues, as 90% of the experience is positive.  For my part, I wanted to do some things, and the cam will not do it, I had to be able to let it go and change what I wanted until I found a process that works and is acceptable.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wansview NC541/W", "Author": "earache", "ReviewID": "R3GYLOW9TULW3P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this IP camera on a whim. I already have cameras and a DVR keeping watch on the outside of my house but wanted something versatile for indoors. I purchased from ATC LLC and to my surprise received a Wansview NC541/W rather than a generic unbranded item. I'm not sure if this makes any difference being that there's so many of these type of cameras, but at least I can go to a website for downloads, firmware updates or support if I need to. I've had a good bit of experience with IP based security systems, as well as held a career in network administration for nearly 20 years - So, this particular item wasn't new territory for me. I'm going to break down my review in steps hoping that it will benefit others.Purchase and seller - The transaction from ATC LLC couldn't have been smoother. Price was great and shipping was incredibly fast. I ordered it in the middle of the day on a Wednesday and received it USPS priority mail on Saturday. Packaging was questionable and had me worried. It was packed in an un-padded, anti-tear type envelope, although it didn't appear damaged or man handled. My worries quickly disappeared after opening the box to find the camera and all accessories well protected with soft Styrofoam from the factory.Unboxing - The IP camera comes with everything you need. The mini CD of applications, a CAT5 patch cable, a plastic plug header for wiring external alarms, Wifi antenna and the power adapter. But the most surprising was finding a mount that can be used for wall or ceiling applications and includes screws and wall anchors, nice. The build quality seems fair but fragile and is made almost entirely of plastic. It probably won't survive a four foot drop onto a hard floor and I would avoid twisting or tilting the camera by hand due to the delicate and precision servo gearing that allows it to pan/tilt. There's a focus ring around the lens which I had to make minor adjustment to after I had it up and running. Just focus on the furthest item and your set, no additional tweaking needed.Setup - Adding this to my network was easy for me and I didn't need to read any manual. I just plugged the camera into my switch, ran the included executable which found the camera within seconds. I assigned a static IP, changed the default administrator password, rebooted and logged in via browser. This sounds easy, and it is if you've done any intermediate home networking. If not, you might want to find someone who has before going any further, or, just avoid products like this and find something more user friendly. The software that finds the camera on you network is Windows only, so if you have a Mac or use Linux you're going to need to get creative if you absolutely need to run it, or manually assign a static IP to your computer in the same range to access the web interface for initial setup. Once logged in there's a plethora of options that can be used, I went directly to the wireless setup. The camera supports WEP, WPA and WPA2 security with both TKIP and AES. My home network uses WPA2 with AES encryption, so I didn't have to dumb down my security on account of this camera. I needed a MAC address since I use MAC filtering at my router and I found it on the \"Info\" page...or so I thought. After triple checking my settings I could not get the camera to connect wirelessly, I was stumped or just too tired at the time. Then I remembered this should have TWO MAC addresses, one for the physical jack and one for the wireless. I logged into my router and temporarily disabled MAC filtering, voila', the camera connected. I then looked at the wireless client list and there was the WiFi MAC I was looking for, I could now add it to my \"allowed\" devices. Moral of this? The MAC address that's shown on the camera info page is the physical jack and nowhere does it display the wireless MAC. The camera supports DDNS and has a recommended server to use, but I didn't bother for two reasons. Firstly, my router is already setup with a DYNDNS account. Second, the recommended server is unknown to me, probably located somewhere in China secretly port scanning my home IP address..but I digress. I enabled motion detection but realized there's no motion detection grid for specific areas, it just alarms with any motion. This isn't bad per-say, just a nice feature that's lacking, and if you aren't careful you could potentially flood an email or FTP account with images. The motion sensitivity can be set which brings it under control and will typically send 4 to 5 images to your intended destination when triggered, it can be also set on a schedule as well. There's three levels of user access if you feel like having others view your camera, administrator, operator and visitor, each with specific operative abilities and supports up to 8 users. It can also sync with Internet time for split second accuracy or your PC clock when logged in. There are a few more features with triggering external alarms, alarm servers and HTTP notification but most users reading this aren't going to use those.Operation - Camera images are exceptionally sharp and clear at all resolutions. I haven't noticed any video lag viewing from work or on my home network even while panning and tilting. The colors are a bit washed out but that's to be expected from a CMOS based camera. The physical P/T movement is very smooth and nearly silent. Infra red illumination works well but has a particularly narrow beam and appears to be effective up to 15 feet. It supports two-way audio but I only have used the \"listen in\" feature and it's marginal at best. Sounds have to be fairly loud and close to the camera and any P/T movement overwhelms any audio it may pick up. Pretty much a gimmick if you ask me.Software - READ THIS FOR CAVEATS - The camera comes with standalone monitoring software and it's Windows only if you're not going to use a browser. The version that came on the mini CD (v1.0.0.21) refused to launch on my XP SP3 machine, it just displayed an error about not being able to read system settings. I Googled the software and found an older version (v1.0.0.17) ironically not on the manufacturers website. This time it worked but found out I wasn't missing much that couldn't already be done in the web interface. They claim this supports viewing from Internet Explorer, Firefox, Android and Blackberry...well, sort of. If you use IE and Windows you're set, just install the ActiveX control and you're off to the races. The interface in IE is most feature rich, but if you use Firefox you cannot record or use the two way audio feature, you can only Pan/Tilt and take snapshots. Things become more absurd for Linux users like me, you cannot view this camera using Firefox or Opera in Linux. If you try you get a 320x240 window with unusable P/T buttons and no video stream. They supply a J2ME package for Java based phones, why not give us Linux users a little love? Eh, guess I'll just have to run it in my XP virtual machine. The supplied Android app didn't work on my Android 1.6 Donut tablet, but that's probably all the better since the coding looks like a preschooler did it. Do yourself a favor and download IP Camera Lite for Android, choose Foscam as your camera manufacturer in the setup and you'll be viewing, panning and tilting from your phone or tablet in no time. I can't comment on the Blackberry app, I'm not allowed to muck-up my work phone. But judging from the supplied Android app you might be better off staying away and find something else.::Pros::-Price and great shipping from seller-Excellent image quality with smooth pan/tilt-Supplied wall/ceiling mount-Supports nearly any WiFi security configuration-IR illumination more than adequate indoors-Near silent mechanical operation-Several alarm options (email, FTP, external)-Decent motion detection once under control::Cons::-Build quality is fragile and cheap feeling-NO LINUX SUPPORT-Limited functionality using Firefox in Windows-Supplied software is flakey and needs alternatives-NOT user friendly for the novice or soccer mom to setup or configureI would definitely recommend this to others who have experience with IP cameras or IP based security systems solely on what you get for the price and image quality. Once this camera is configured and it's settings are adjusted correctly it does everything it claims, and does it well. If you think think this (or any other IP camera for that matter) will be plug and play you're going to be highly frustrated and disappointed. Those folks may be better off looking elsewhere or consider a monthly monitoring service from a security company.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice toy, and it has some uses...", "Author": "Woodlandsman \"Woodlandsman\"", "ReviewID": "R37E9HHHMYUAWS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well, it does the basics - it does work. And, once you've got it going it works well enough for some simple chores.I'm on an imac, but had a pc to run through the setup disc and it only took about ten minutes to bring this thing to life - about half of that looking for a magnifying glass to read the manual. But, turns out the manual is on the CD anyway. As is a \"discovery tool\" for finding the camera on your local net with your mac or imac once it's plugged into your network with a hard wire. Just plug everything in and click away. That gives you the basics for a mac or imac user - you can at least get it working. Beyond that, I'm not sure how you'd reset the password or user name... Or, get it to run DHCP automatically without the windows software to make it easy.As for the other details, on a mac or pc, if you can access your router, look for the device under you mac address table. My camera's default was - xxx.178. If you know your devices, you can noodle out which one is the IP camera. From there, if you know networking, you can assign a new port number - if you need to - both ways so that the camera and the router know what port to talk to each other through. It's not hard, once you climb the learning curve. Don't email asking me how, I'm about to put the thing back in the box to return it...Why? Because I was going to use it as a (mostly) concealed gate camera and this thing has a silly blinking light, a high contrast silver and black face.By the way, if you're going to use it wirelessly, you'll have to connect with a cable to your router and take a look at the menu tabs on the viewing screen that you use to watch camera video. Select the wireless tab and fill in the blanks so that the camera can log into your router wirelessly.Don't forget to save your setting and to unplug and replug to reboot the camera - also kill the browser screen and then navigate back to it.Any who, since it doesn't suit my needs,and it's not iphone compatable, I think I'll just move onto another unit. They have one for $10.00 more, that works with iphones... Maybe I'll do that... If it comes in all black and doesn't have flashing lights. (Who needs that?)I'll give it 4 stars for being honest.

If you drop the updating down to 2fps and/or 320x240, you will have much better results. I can only imagine that if the promised two-way audio worked that would add even more to the bandwidth suck.Unfortunately, the pan up/down motor failed just a few days later, leaving me with only side-to-side motion.

For setup, we ultimately found youtube to be the most helpful.  But for port forwarding, I finally had to hire someone for this process, after 3 days of tearing my hair out.  It turns out that most of the videos & instructions for port forwarding leave out some key information in the process.  I got 90% of it right & learned a lot, but ultimately that \"missing link\" was resolved only by the tech I hired.I'm not going to discuss how all the details for our setup because I've learned it varies greatly depending upon the country you live in, the router you have, and the public IP address that's for your computer.  That last part is what was missing for me, & it turns out you can go to google and type \"IP address\", your public IP address will appear just below the search box.  The cameras each have a private IP address, but you must enter the public IP address when creating custom settings for port forwarding via your router's online setup page.  I also learned that if you have more than one camera, each must be assigned its own individual port number.Once it was finally set up correctly, the cameras worked great, which is why I give 4 starts.

All im going to review is its functions. I am able to use it on a mac, iPhone, pc via special webb address any time I want.  I can get alerts sent to several emails of my choosing using AOL as my dedicated email server.  I use AOL because it was the most effective server to send alert pictures from the camera.  I had trouble with HOTMAIL and Yahoo, and finally gave up on them so AOL was the easiest choice.  Whats not so good.  In my experience  the motion sensor is too sensitive even at the lowest setting, however this is because the camera is place facing a window and as the sunlight dims and brightens bc of clouds, it sets off the camera sensor and an alert email is sent.  The camera location is the best place for me so I will not move it.  On cloudy or over cast days alerts seem to be less frequent, however there are times I can get several alerts through out the day.  I don't mind the emails bc it lets me know the camera is working.  I do not use the cameras WiFi feature, though I could if I wanted too.  There is a way to do that but I am not going to explain it.  My camera is working via long Ethernet cable.  I keep things simple to rule out chance of error as it is a security camera.  Its been working flawlessly for over a year so Im keeping this way.  The camera in one place and I do not mess with the functions of moving the camera around.  Ive read other complaining that the gears fail, possibly from over use.  The images of the camera are not high quality when email alerts are sent but are adequate to see someone.  This camera is poor for seeing detailed images of someones face but it does well overall to identify people you know.  Overall this is a cheap and in my experience dependable security camera.  You dont have to pay for a subscription to get alerts and you can activate the camera using your smart phone or any computer.

It's not hard, and the directions are quite clear, but you have to do it in the right order.  There are a few \"gotchas\" that tripped me up, but only for a few minuts.First, you have to install it with the WIRED connection.  Run the install program BSEARCH.EXE on the install disk.  Press F3 and it will find the camera.On the right hand side set up DHCP, put in username/password and update the camera.After it reboots, search again (F3) and then Browse (F4).

If you disconnected the cable and you can now see the web page, all is well.  Go into your router and reserve the IP so you'll know from now on.The one \"gotcha\" that tripped me up, the wired and wireless have different mac addresses.  I should have known that, but didn't think about it.  I configured it, then reserved the IP but it used the WIRED MAC address.  Took me a few minutes to figure out that I needed to be connected wirelessly to find the wireless MAC.  (duh!)The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars... I have several devices that are NATted behind my router.  All work fine except this one.

Babb \"kites0852\"", "ReviewID": "R13GQSJ01HJ71K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was hesitant to purchase after looking at the negative reviews, but for the price I decided to try.First off, I would about guarantee that the majority of setup issues experienced are not caused by the camera but by the router being used by the customer purchasing.  Mine was an uncommon router and I had to play with the settings to get what I want.Also, anyone knows who has setup devices such as this including: wifi printers, etc, typically you must ALWAYS connect it with a cable to your system first to help setup.  After setup is complete, then you can unplug the cable and complete the wireless portion.To set my system up, I powered the camera inside beside my computer and plugged it directly into the router.  This helps avoid issues with wireless and firewalls until you get everything else set.  THEN unplug it and follow the instructions.  Once working, I took it outside and mounted it.  No problems at that point.I did not install any software.  I did RUN one file from the CD but did not install any.  If you purchase, to help setup, there is a youtube video that helps you just search for it.  I followed most of it, where I could and then experimented.The quality of the image is not the greatest, but then again it is a $50 camera.  I opted to purchase an inexpensive camera to see if I could get it to work.  I am using this camera for a weather cam on my weather website.  I have not been able to get it to transmit to the internet directly, but that is not the fault of the camera, it is because of my router's security.It will pan and tilt, but if you use the buttons in the browser to do so, bear in mind it will slew across until it reaches the furthest edge before rotating back the other direction.  Same with tilt.  It goes stop to stop.  You can stop it and set it where you want.  You can also use the additional buttons to set the image in the direction you want.  You can also set in the software for it to continually pan.IF YOU mount it upside down, ENSURE you click both the mirror and reversal button in the viewing browser.  Doing this makes it pan and tilt like it should.  If you do not mirror after reversing the image, it is backwards and the controls will respond backwards.The four stars is because of the lack of material to help.  I do not like CD manuals.  Most companies fail to realize that I am using my computer to set up their product and do not want to switch between screens to see the instructions.  Good to have a backup on the disc, but a printed manual should be included, a FULL manual, not a fold out palm sized informational flyer.Another problem I ran into was trying to get an image (still shot) from the camera.  Many software solutions want to use the camera to find that image.  This camera does not appear to store a still image in it's memory.  Instead you have a cgi link to get the live feed.  Problem there is getting that feed to use.  My weather software was able to do so, fortunately.  Had to use filezilla to capture that to my weather computer, but it works.Still tweaking to get live feed over the internet.  I cannot get it through my outside IP address because of the router....  Tried some forwarding solutions like DYNDNS but they were unable to as well.  It seems my router blocks access.  So if you have this problem, it may not be the fault of the camera but your router security settings....just saying.All in all, a good buy.  Just requires patience to setup.I am not proficient, by any means at this sort of thing.

I use a Mac so I had to install Windows on a Virtual Machine and force the ethernet port to the VM in order to use the included software to find out what the camera's initial IP was...I believe it was an APIPA IP.Once I got the IP I temporarily put the Windows VM on the same network as the camera then was able to update the camera's IP to something that fits into my wireless network. From that point I could finish setting it up in my Mac's browser. For me Safari, Chrome, Firefox all seem to work with this camera's web browser interface though you can get a better experience with using IE in Windows.I can't compare this to any other cameras as this is the first of its kind I've ever owned but as far as set up goes I'm sure there are other cameras out there that can provide a much better set up experience. If you can get past that, the quality of the camera is worth it I think.In terms of quality I believe I'm getting decent quality relative to what I paid for it. Sure there are higher quality cameras, none that I own, but those cost hundreds or even thousands.  In full light conditions it's very easy to make out people, pets, faces, etc... I am easily able to distinguish what's what. Just make sure you place the camera where there's no light shining directly into the lens, just like your regular old point-and-shoot cameras. In low light conditions the IR does a good job of lighting up about 10-15 feet...to the point where you can still make out faces. Anything beyond that is still visible, but basically only as shadows and depending on how sensitive you have the motion detection set the motion detection can still work in the dark. In complete darkness I was surprised by how clear the video and photos were. In dark situations make sure there's nothing reflective or bright colored within a few feet of the lens as it just reflects back and basically blacks out that portion of the view.To elaborate on the motion detection a bit...you can set the sensitivity from 1 to 10, 10 being most sensitive. I find myself using between 6-9 because 5 doesn't seem sensitive enough and 10 is too sensitive and picks up everything. I have mine set up to use a gmail account to email me photos when motion alarm is triggered. 6 photos are emailed along with a date and time stamp...I don't yet know if it's possible to change the number of photos that are sent.  You can also set it up to upload photos to an FTP server and there are other things you can do with them as well but I haven't gotten into those yet.The iPhone App I believe was like $1.99 and it works well.  Once you get the camera added you can do the following with this particular camera: View live video, take snapshots, pan, tilt, zoom (zoom like you do in the Photos app), set the image resolution (320x240 or 640x480), brightness, contrast, orientation, turn on/off motion detection and set sensitivity, turn on/off whether it sends mail upon motion detection, turn the IR LEDs on/off, adjust the speed at which the pan/tilt moves, and turn the network LED on/off. You can also enable sounds so you can hear what's coming through the mic on the camera, but that doesn't work all that well for me.  Apparently you can also enable the mic on your iPhone to talk through the camera's speaker, but that doesn't work for me either and I'm not even sure if this camera actually has that feature.To set up mail server settings, who gets an email upon motion detection, and most other settings not listed above, you need to do it through a web browser.I don't really know what else to put but feel free to ask questions and I'll help in any way I can.", "Date": "July 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Everything that I hoped for - and more...", "Author": "Jimmy Dean", "ReviewID": "R2IP3ZW6RYRLZ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this webcam so that my wife can monitor the kids while they are playing out back.  After reading the reviews indicating that it might be a bit difficult to setup, I decided to give it a try anyway since I do have quite a bit of technical know-how.I have to say that I found it relatively easy to configure.  The only problem that I had was that I was trying to set it up while directly connected to a notebook computer after ensuring that the IP address of the network card on the notebook was set to the same domain as the IP camera (i.e. 192.168.0.x).  I was able to change the address on the camera, but was unable to re-connect to it on the new IP domain.  Once I connected the device to my router, I was able to connect to it and complete configuration.  I'm guessing that you might need a crossover ethernet cable if you are trying to configure it while directly connected to a computer.  It's better to just connect it to a switch or a router.The only other challenge came when configuring access to the camera from the Internet.  After implementing all of the necessary port forwarding rules on my router, I realized that I also have to forward ports from my Vonage IP phone device - which is also a router.  So, my network has two routers and the port forwarding had to be configured on both routers.  Once I did this - Bingo, everything worked as expected.It is very nice that this camera comes with its own built in DDNS service.  This is great for those who subscribe to an Internet service provider and do not have a static IP address.I read some reviews indicating that the camera will only work with Firefox.  It actually will work with Internet Explorer and provides more functionality under IE.  The only thing is that you need to download the plug-in (a link for which is provided on the device homepage).The instructions on the provided CD are much more complete than the paper instructions that are provided, so I recommend reading it.The camera provides a number of very useful features.  You don't have to connect it to an alarm system in order to utilize some of the alarm features.  You can configure it to sense motion.  Once configured, you can have snapshots taken and e-mailed to you as well as have the images sent to an FTP server.The camera has a very wide range of movement (horizontally and vertically).  If you install it upside-down, you can even flip the image rightside-up and mirror the image so that it appears correctly in your browser.  The pan and tilt directional buttons work based on your view settings, so you don't get confused about which button to push to make the camera go the way that you want.Some reviews indicated that they don't know where the recorded video goes.  You can check and set where the video is saved by going to the Advanced - Other Settings section of the browser interface for the webcam.The phone remote monitoring support just makes this camera even better.  I was able to access the camera via my iPhone (4) with no problems.All-in-all, I can say with confidence that this webcam is everything that I had hoped for and more.

I just wanted to point out a couple of things that you might want to keep in mind.-Infrared on this camera (night vision) is a fun little toy and works pretty well in small to medium sized rooms. It is not very good in an an open outdoor space-you can't see much. And the big thing I wanted to let everyone know, the IR will reflect off glass if you're planning point it out a window, you will not be able to see anything. YOU CANNOT DISABLE IR ON THIS CAMERA, so if you do plan on pointing it out a window, I'd consider picking a model that doesn't have IR or one that allows you to turn it off.-These units are being re-branded and re-sold with different software interfaces written by different companies. You may order one and it may not being the exact one you're ordering in terms of color or the name on it. I ordered two from Amazon, they were identical- but my friend ordered 1 a week later and got something different. It was essentially the same, but I know this might bother some people, so a heads up there.-I actually constructed an outdoor camera dome I am currently using this unit outside in the cold and snow. Make no mistake, this is a cheaply constructed camera, and is really for indoor use only. But for $50 I figured what the heck, and so far, so good. We'll see if it lasts.-It is color. After I ordered, I read a review saying it wasn't and it got me a little panicked.-There is no ZOOM, but a quick word about \"zoom\" in cameras in this price range. It's not really a zoom on other units anyway. In most cases, it's just blown up grainy view of the same picture you were looking at before and isn't good for much. I'm just making you aware that if you pass on this camera and spend another $30 on a camera that says it has zoom, it may not really be a zoom anyway.This is actually a good camera to buy if you don't know much about cameras and want to learn about what you want and need, and then maybe upgrade to something a little better when you're a more familiar with your needs. For example, the IR was a big draw for me initially, to be able to see in the dark- and now for my purposes, it's been more of a pain than anything (and was more of a novelty than anything to begin with).For what you pay for this camera, it's tough to go wrong.

My second purchase was a Wansview model 541 (this model) to save a few bucks. The Wansview took a while for me to figure out because the IP of the camera comes fixed at factory set 192.168.0.178. Why I have no idea. This IP was out of the range of my router so I had to figure out how to connect to it. If you have a Linksys router it should work fine. The foscam camera came with a automatic IP that will adjust to your router. Typically with these IP cameras you plug in the ethernet wire camera to router and next plug in the power cord in that order (imporant) wait for the connection and enter the IP in your browser the camera is using in your router and you will connect. NOT WITH THIS CAMERA! If the factory IP I listed doesn't fit in your router range you must insert the disc that came with the camera, run the BS search, select the B model and hit scan then check the automatic IP box and it will update and you will be set. The camera reset and came up in my router as 10.0.x.xx and I could connect fine! I double checked the alarm motion detection and its the same as the Foscam. Now to the pros and cons:PROS:Picture almost as good as a foscam but colors are washed up a little.Listening audio works fine (only on IE or my android ip cam viewer app)camera movement works fine but no presets (bummer)camera alarm works nice, it sends me emails with pictures and sensitivity can easily be adjusted. After double checking its the same as my Foscam.CONS:Night Vision IR will not shutoff (foscam does)Listening audio doesn't work on Chrome or Firefox (foscam does)NO presets (ptz) You can't set where the camera will point except with manual movement. My foscam can be set with presets that will automatically scan to that location (very handy) This function on my foscam works great on my android phone using IP Cam viewer. I wanted the preset function and was disappointed that the Wansview doesn't have it even though wansview lists it as a PTZ camera on their web site. I use firefox alot and I was also disappointed that there is no listening audio on that browser. The foscam uses a VLC plugin for audio on the firefox browser. I do use the android app IP Cam viewer pro which works great. So to finish, if an extra $25 dollars won't break you, get a FOSCAM.UPDATE: As I use both cameras and compare their functions, I updated over time and use. I have since (today 2/1/2012) purchased the latest fosccam model F18910W. Will review after I receive it !", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Camera doestn work", "Author": "S.

I wanted a camera which would work independent of any computer and which would automatically upload, via FTP, an image on a scheduled frequency.The Wainsview NC541W, for which I paid $47 via Amazon, does just that.  The FTP function works reliably.  I was able to set the update frequency to 60 seconds and set the image name to one of my choice.  This camera is fully compatible with WeatherUnderground's webcam service.Setup is pretty easy.  Install the CD, connect the camera to your router or computer via the included network cable and run the BSearch_en.exe to locate the camera.  Once the camera is located you will need to log into it in order to set the wireless and FTP settings.  Do that and your done.

The LED's will reflect back into the camera from the window glass and if angled so the reflections are out of view, will not provide enough lighting to enable night viewing through a window.

I have seen so many negative reviews stating that the camera doesn't do this or that but when I got the camera and did a little bit of reading in their own user guide I found out it can do it. I could see how the concepts of networking and wireless can be confusing but their two user guides, one for the camera and the other for the software have step by step instructions to help you get through it.When you get the camera first thing you just have to plug it into your network with the physical connector. It comes with a program called Bsearch_en. Run that on your windows machine and click search. Just follow the directions outlined in the documentation and you should be at the web interface fairly quickly. From there you can change the username, set the sensitivity of the motion detection and all that.The included software for the camera also worked great. I loaded up IPCMonitor and after reading the documentation saw that you can record as much video or take screen shots as you want. You can set it to straight record any time period or you can actually set it to record based on motion detection. If you want the motion detection to pick up something small you just have to set the motion sensitivity way up.The camera is also reasonably good at seeing in low light. It isn't the best camera by far but the fact that it has decent IR capability on such a cheap monitor is impressive. The microphone pickup and communication back isn't great but it would be reasonable if you had this setup at a door way. Also there is a manual ring around the camera that I found would greatly improve the quality of the image. I just kept sliding it around for a little while until I found the best setting for my room.I also followed the directions in section 4 and have the camera setup so I can watch it on my android phone. They provided a camera viewer on the CD but it was really bad and wouldn't even keep your settings. I wound up setting up IP cam viewer lite for my needs. My one only complaint and it is very minor is that the camera can't handle too many feeds at one time. I was using the camera software, and the android phone and stream got kind of choppy. The video was plenty good enough to see what was going on.The camera though gets five out of five stars with me. It has so much versatility and power for under $50. I have been able to customize and leave it out where I need to and have it only record when motion happens, even for just the hours that I want it to. The only feature that I could possibly really want is zoom but for my needs that doesn't really apply.

Rogers", "ReviewID": "R2HUCP3JLDXDEG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned a number of IP cameras over the past several years, and use them for keeping an eye on the house when I'm away, making sure that the cat's feeder is working, making sure that the AC/Heat are operating properly, and making sure that the sump pump hasn't failed and the basement flooded.  But recently I decided that it would be nice to have a day/night camera, so I started looking at options.  I've traditionally used Linksys/Cisco or Dlink cameras, but based on the reviews on Amazon I decided to give this camera a try.  Based strictly on the price, I was a bit skeptical, but for $50 I decided that I didn't have that much to lose.GREAT decision!Pros:--The image quality is better than some more expensive cameras that I've owned.  Decent color reproduction during the day, and crisp black/white in the dark.--The pan/tilt is smooth, and has a very good range of motion.  It can point straight vertical, and can pan through about 300 degrees.  Down tilt is limited to only about 15 degrees below vertical, but  you can account for that with mounting angle.--The microphone actually works!  And works well.  You can clearly hear what's happening in the area surrounding the camera.--Compatible with IE, Firefox, Chrome, and all of my Android devices (phones and tablets).--Works great with IPCamViewer app on Android, including motion controls--Motion detection works well--Handles a wide range of lighting conditions with grace--Can interface with external lighting and alarms, although I've not done this.Cons:--As noted above, down tilt angle is somewhat limited, but can be accounted for with mounting--Motion capture, based on motion detection, is limited to still frames.  But when motion is detected it will grab 6 still frames and send them to either an FTP site or email address.  This is adequate for most purposes.--Documentation is lacking, and is badly translated from Chinese.  But if you have ever set up an IP camera, you'll have no trouble.--The web-based user interface is a bit spartan, and includes multiple misspellings and poorly translated text.  But this in no way detracts from the functionality or usability of the camera.--If I wanted to interface the camera to external lighting and alarms, I have no idea how I would go about doing it.  The camera comes with the necessary plugs, etc, but there is absolutely no documentation on how to go about the electrical part of the interface.  I'm sure that some Googling would solve the problem if I ever care about trying it.Setup is straightforward.  Basically you plug the camera into your wired network, run a utility that they supply on CD to find the camera, log in using the default admin account, set up your wireless network creds, your static or dynamic IP, add some accounts, and that's it.  Then unplug from the wired network, reboot the camera, and you are up.  If you want to view the camera from outside your home network, you just need to set up a forwarded port on your home router.  Again, if you have ever configured an IP camera, this is second nature stuff.  I didn't need to follow the poor instructions.Overall, a GREAT camera, especially for the price.

I want to share some information about the manufacturer provided Dynamic DNS capability that hopefully will help some people out.For those of you who aren't familiar with DDNS, it is the ability to track your public IP address and update DNS servers whenever that IP address changes.  That way, you can always type in a name instead of an IP address, and that name will always take you to the right place.The DDNS service provided by the manufacturer is somewhat misleading.  It's a very useful feature, but it's not actually DDNS.  It's actually a URL forwarding service.  Rather than hosting a DNS entry for your camera that maps to the correct public IP address, they instead host a website at the address provided with your camera that forwards you to your camera's public IP address.  It's a subtle difference, but it does manifest itself in a few ways, one of which is important.The first thing you'll notice is that if you open up a web browser and type in the URL they provide (e.g., deviceID.nwsvr.com), the URL will automatically change into an IP address.  That's because the deviceID.nwsvr.com site is actually a hosted website somewhere that automatically forwards you to your IP address, which would be considered a separate website by your browser.  For comparison, if you go to amazon.com, the name \"amazon.com\" stays in the URL of your browser when the page loads rather than changing into an IP address.  However, if you clicked a link to an external website while you were on amazon.com, the URL in your browser would change to reflect the new site.  This is effectively what happens with your camera, except you don't have to click on a link.The second and more important thing you'll notice is how this affects ports.  The web server on your camera will run on port 80 by default, which is the standard port for web servers.  If you want, you can run it on a separate port.  When you do that, you have to add the port number to the ip address when connecting to the camera.  So for example if your camera runs on port 81, you'd have to type in w.x.y.z:81 into your browser where w.x.y.z represents the IP address of your camera.  However, if you try to use the DDNS name provided with the camera, you'll see some strange behavior.  First, if you type in deviceID.nwsvr.com:81, it will fail.  Second, if you leave off the :81 on the end, it will work.  This again is because the DDNS name they provide is actually taking you to a separate website (which runs on the standard port 80) which then forwards you to the correct URL for your camera (which in this case would include the :81).  So if you type in deviceID.nwsvr.com into your web browser, the address will quickly change to w.x.y.z:81, and the camera will show up correctly.  This is important for a few reasons:1.) If you are trying to connect to your camera from outside your private network by using the provided URL, you have to leave off the port number.  If you are connecting by using the IP address, then you need to include the port number2.) I may lose a few people here, but when you are doing your port forwarding on your router, your external and internal ports must match if you are going to use the URL.  For example, if you had 10 cameras at your house, you would have all 10 running on their own internal, private IP addresses.  For simplicity, you may want to run all of them on port 80 so that you don't have to mess with port numbers when connecting from the internal network.  However, when setting up your port forwarding, you would have to pick a separate port for each camera, since they all have to share the same public IP address.  Your router should have no problem with this.  You can map an external port number to a separate internal port number.  For example, external port 81 may map to camera 1 on port 80, and external port 82 may map to camera 2 on port 80, etc.  However, this blows up when you try to use the provided DDNS URL.  If your camera is set to run on port 80, then the DDNS URL will try to connect to the camera at the public IP address using port 80, which will fail, since it's mapped to something else externally (e.g., 81).  Also, as I mentioned before, if you try to append the correct port number to the URL, it will fail because the URL actually is connecting to a URL forwarding service which only runs on 80.I hope that was somewhat clear and helpful for anyone trying to figure out why the DDNS URL won't work when using different external and internal ports.", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "Anh Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R1S1O3AY47C9HG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great buy compared to Foscam camera in term of pricing.

I'm a network consultant so it was ridiculously easy, but just use the IP setup .exe on the CD after you plug it into your router and change the IP to whatever you want.Standard stuff is all there, like motion detection email alerts (default sensitivity was perfect for me), etc., but it also has options like patrol, which pans/tilts the camera back and forth on a horizon to take in what I'd guess is a 270 degree field of view.  Pretty cool.All the info specific to each cam is on the bottom of the device, but the included CD has a few useful tools if you require them, including mobile apps (although I wasn't impressed with the android version; I'll stick with free third-party viewers on Market).  I used my own dyndns.org account as opposed to theirs, which connected immediately and works great.Wifi connectivity works fine, though I only tried it in close proximity to the router.  Wasn't thrilled with the b/g, but can't complain for the price.Read a couple of knucklehead reviews prior to purchase, but I'm happy to say they were totally baseless and I'm glad I bought it.  For the guy whose cam isn't set to factory defaults: that's what the factory reset button on every network device is for; if that doesn't work, exchange it for another, which is what Amazon is for.  For the clowns complaining that it's made in China: that's why it costs $60, not $160; if you're going to be a bigot, go blow your money on an american product and at least stop being a cheap bigot...Dave", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Wireless Camera For The Money", "Author": "Kajankow", "ReviewID": "RNCCKNMFBCOT0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great wireless camera.
