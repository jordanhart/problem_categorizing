Their DVR has no instructions on how to view the system on your mobile phone.  I have asked them numerous times for information by phone and by email yet they have yet to respond.  Overall I think they system is pretty good but I can't get in touch with anyone from GW for information on how to view it on my phone.  My item has since been removed from Amazon.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$780.00", "Features": "1080P realtime preview, 1CH 1080P realtime playback\nSupport E-SATA\nSupport LOOP\n4 alarm in/1 out\nSupport VGA &HDMI; Output\nUtilize graphic user interface\nSupport full mouse control\nSupport IE browser to remote view\nSupport mobile surveillance by phones with Andriod, WinCE, Symbian, and iPhone\nSupport multi-level user management.
