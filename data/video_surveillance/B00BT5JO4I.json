{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good camera but I was expecting a 4pack", "Author": "Henry", "ReviewID": "R3V9V8KB0GTF8P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I received and opened the package, I was wandering where the other three cameras are. I went back online to review my order. I realized that I had only ordered 1 camera. The picture displaying the camera can be deceiving since it has 4 cameras in the photo (I wanted to order a 4-pack to add to my existing system). I will pay better attention to the description next time. As for the camera, It has a clear and sharp picture, it seems to be built well, and it does what it should. Now, back to Amazon to find a 3-pack.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BT5JO4I"}}
