Creek", "ReviewID": "R28NHJBGE8BQ9M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I tested this camera for a few days just sitting out on my desk before mounting it up high in my basement.  I have it connected to a blue iris monitoring server. It's been running for a couple of weeks and all is well. The only issue I've noticed is that the camera didn't boot correctly when I rebooted the Cisco ASA5505 firewall that is a providing its power. I suspect that is due to the short cycle time of the port during the reboot.The field of view is good. Pan and tilt function are smooth and quiet. Having power over Ethernet is the big selling feature for me, as I don't want to have to install a bunch of injectors. I do have a fair amount of cat5 wire in my house, so I can reach the locations that will support cameras and not have to resort to wireless.It would be nice if white was a color option.", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "firmware not so good", "Author": "bgood", "ReviewID": "R2L84N78CP0FOK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Basic PoE camera.

I have 2 up outside (exposed to the elements but under the roof overhang) and 2 inside. the construction/plastic seem a bit low grade thus it seems a little fragile (I would expect it to be destroyed if dropped from any reasonable distance onto a hard surface.) I have a small PC setup running iSpy (excellent freeware surveillance software) that is linked to the cameras and mic's with motion triggering. Works flawlessly! but in huge part to the software which does support this camera, and its pan/tilt feature.They work good overall, I used in combination with the TP-LINK TL-POE150S to send power as I did not want to run AC through the house to each camera. Performance is questionable but ok, they work and have been running 24/7 for the last month with no issues but best I can get out of them is around 9 fps with 6 fps average. I can't seem to get the camera to run any faster (maybe my setup related but I believe the holdup is with the camera.) I did have some additional performance issues with my outside ones during the day. I have a lot of trees and bushes etc. in the picture and a little wind and some sunlight creating a lot of shade spots there ends up being a lot of movement in the video and when viewing via its internal web page at max resolution (640x480 which is pretty low already) it would freeze and I would have to power cycle the camera. (this did not happen at a lower resolution.) and a restart would always restore the picture after it botted back up, though it would freeze again if to much movement in picture. Viewing it at the same resolution with the same amount of movement in the picture over the surveillance software did not have issues or freezing.I found that if you want to connect to it directly to view the feed, using firefox and the cameras  \"Server Push Mode\" was far better than trying to get IE to work with it (which is oddly what is recommended?)Overall it was worth the cost and setup was easy, the free software I used 'iSpy' supports the cameras including the pan/tilt so I have no complaints. It works and I hope it keeps working for a long time.", "Date": "July 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow this is bad.", "Author": "rnaconsulting", "ReviewID": "R186H23D88V5RE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Foscam should have recalled their defective cameras that are known to reboot under certain busy scenes and lighting conditions so that buyers won't be wasting their time debugging the cameras for them. We are switching to another brand, that's it for me. It is unethical if not criminal to continue to sell products that are known to have the same manufacturing defect for years. Google it and you will find this problem exists for certain batches of Foscam cameras. We went through some 9-10 cameras of different models with the same problem.

I use it with 2 iPhones, iPad, and 2 computers with low coat 3rd party apps. Great at night, audio ok, pan&tilt; silent and reliable.Setup and support feels more like open source. MAC addresses are mislabeled (wifi vs eithernet), They assume you know about DHCP reservations and port forwarding on your specific router. Included tools are limited and primitive.

My First Camera works perfectly", "Author": "David Higgins", "ReviewID": "RGPSMWQXUUHJZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I say wow since I always thought that night vision that actually worked was really expensive.  I did a test and turned off the light in one of my bedrooms which has this camera and it is completely dark.  I turned on night vision and I can actually see everything in the room clearly as if a huge flashlight is coming from the camera!  The quality is great and I can rotate the camera how I please.  I read another review where someone said it uses too much bandwidth, so I will have to test that out once I leave.  The software could add such a feature and a zoom option as well.

I have the 8910E's sitting outside under cantilevered sections of roof where they are not exposed to the elements.  Although it remains to be seen whether they will hold up in a New York winter cold spell.  Setup was a breeze although I had months of experience with the 8910W's.  Everything is run through a Blue Iris server which really should be required software when buying these cameras.  POE is supplied through a Trendnet TPE-S44 switch.  The only drawbacks I have found is one does not handle dawn lighting very well and green leaves on trees appear orange/yellow.  Also, the lens angles are not wide enough.

(Five stars for those cameras.) Bought two of these POE units to help simplify things, though. The first one died after a week (couldn't get a refund from Amazon because I was out of town beyond the 30 days). The second unit became flakey (spontaneously going off-line) after about 7 weeks and a firmware update provided no improvement. No refund was available in this case either, because it was past 30 days.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheap and does the job...", "Author": "Rubber Duck", "ReviewID": "R3ADEM6XVQARAQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I only give it 4 stars because it's so cheap... this is the low end stuff. Relative to proper surveillance cameras, the quality of Foscam is mediocre. However, it's probably the best quality of the low-end cameras, and it definitely does the job. Foscam also integrates well with many software solutions... it's just a very widespread product.The main problem I had with this camera is that it occasionally disappears from the network - as if it dies but then later comes back to life somehow. I'm an experienced network administrator, and all of my debugging pointed at a camera problem. Rebooting or reconnecting the camera fixes the problem, but my application involved remote surveillance (over the internet), so I couldn't physically reboot/reconnect the camera.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "very good", "Author": "Robert Kruthaupt", "ReviewID": "R3PXUAZCXMFXO5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "for the price of this camera I cannot complain.good night vision and easy to setupPOE reduces the wiring and makes the connection more stable", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works great with Blue Iris", "Author": "Theodore E Gardiner", "ReviewID": "R3HHUDUW4EZFI4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Been using for four months now...works great.  I live in a tropical country and have it outdoors under a roof and protected from rain.  Absolutely no problems with overheating as some foscam units are reputed to do.  Easy enough to configure and use with an android remote viewing program and with blue iris NVR software.  I am able to see the image and control the pan/tilt over the internet from 10000 miles away.  Night vision is better than any of my other analog or digital cameras, and day image quality is good.

Kisbey", "ReviewID": "RJPTR6VPXCEPI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is pretty much the perfect cheap PoE camera -- I'm now up to four of these around the property.  The resolution isn't stellar, but the light sensitivity and feature set are first class.  It's by far the best camera I've tried in low and zero-illumination scenarios.  Color response is decent, and frame rate is acceptable for a security or monitoring application, though it may not be your first choice for video-conferencing.I've had a few of these mounted outdoors under the eaves of various buildings for nearly a year now, with no issues or degradation in performance.  The web-controlled pan & tilt are imprecise and a bit slow, but the fact that it sees in total darkness, has a built-in microphone, and all of it is available through the GUI, makes up for the very few shortcomings.The manufacturer makes an outdoor dome for these, though the dome interferes with the IR capability.  Frankly, the LED's aren't strictly necessary, as the low-light performance of this camera pretty good even without the illumination.  Mine are unprotected but at this price point, they're almost disposable.Tip: If you're using a DVR setup, ensure your software can handle a JPEG stream before buying this -- that caused me some headaches and I actually ended up switching DVR platforms to keep the cameras.  Also, get the new firmware; there are stability issues with the earlier firmware releases.Overall, I strongly recommend these, particularly in a monitoring role for dim lighting scenarios, such as a barn or a garage.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good camera with one huge problem", "Author": "Sean", "ReviewID": "R3J74VWEQ35IX0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've gone through 3 of these cameras from 2 different vendors (Foscam US included), and they all have same issue: when exposed to certain pattern/light conditions, they reset.

I needed it for a small business install using Cisco POE switches.  So far it has worked out great.  I loved these little cameras already, and the POE in this instance made things so much easier than using Wifi and having to run Power to all the locations I needed to place them.  Much easier to just run Cat6 and call it good.  I won't get too much into the features as I already knew I liked them, but it is a full featured camera that plays well with software like BlueIris for recording.  It also plays well with android smartphones for the full range of functions including both audio listening and speaking (although for speaking you really need to be on the internal network to get much to come across very well).", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid IP Camera", "Author": "King H", "ReviewID": "R39V5RYMIEHPX0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Meets all expectations.
