{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Perfect for my needs", "Author": "D. H.", "ReviewID": "R6IZHKV1F481G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this Q-See dome camera for an extra camera that I set up with my Q-See SDI DVR. I had it installed on the ceiling of my porch, and I have to say that it has a very wide view point. I can see not only the sides of the porch, but I can also see all the way across the street as well. It has great clarity, and it seems to hold up well to the cold wet rainy days we have had lately. I have my SDI DVR connected to my living room TV, and the camera that I had installed on the side of my house, we had to drill a hole through the side of the house to keep the wire from being seen. However, this one, because it is installed on the ceiling of the porch, we just ran the wire through the crack of the doorway, and along the base board of the living room walls, and connected it to the DVR. There was no drilling that needed to be done. I have had several wireless surveillance cameras in the past, and the one thing I have noticed, is the clarity isn't as good as a wired camera. Then there is always the issue of recharging the camera as well.So I am pretty happy with this dome camera, because even at night, you can see very clearly what is happening around your house. I have a street light that is directly across the street from my home, so I haven't been able to test it in pitch dark, but it is perfect for the spot that I have it in.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "I have not yet been able to make it work", "Author": "Orion", "ReviewID": "R146FBJRTKZC5Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My console is Defender SN502-4CHX. The yellow cable seems to be compatible. I am not sure about the power cable. I tried several ways of hooking that up, including plugging the camera directly in to the wall. That just made the console beep. The guide is not helpful. Under \"trouble shooting\" it says: \"Cup hand over lens to see if IR LEDs illuminate with a faint red glow\". Nowhere does it tell you what to do if there is no red glow.So I suppose there are three possibilities. Either the camera is broken and it will never work, in which case I have wasted enough time on it. Or, possibly, I am doing something dumb and setting it up wrong. Or third, the camera is not compatible with my Defender console.I don't know if the camera is compatible with my Defender console. How would I know that? There doesn't seem to be any information about that anywhere convenient. It doesn't say anything about it in the Amazon description, or in the user manual.That's bad. Compatible software and complete documentation are important. I am giving this product one star for failing to satisfy me in any way at all.", "Date": "November 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not As Compatible As You Think", "Author": "Candra C.

My husband actually works with commercial wires and installs things like this and informed me that I would need an SDI DVR to view the image on the camera. We do not own one of these, as it's a commercial grade [professional] monitor.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "wish it was compatible...", "Author": "dulzon", "ReviewID": "RBI6O539PV6U3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Solidly constructed camera which unfortunately was not compatible with the current technology we have.

It was installed near our front door and my main complaint with that unit was that it didn't have IR sothe pictures were hard to see at night.  And of course, that's when you want to be able to see clear pictures of any suspicious activity going on.  That's why I was excited to see the New Model which does have IR or what they call Night Visions. However, I had forgotten that we cannot install it on our NEW porch as we recently had new siding installed and the ceiling on our porch is basically siding. Not enough weight to support the camera safely.", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "not wireless", "Author": "Jason P.

This should not be daunting, unless you are the kind of guy who hates to cut holes in your siding.  You could, I suppose, run the cable along clips, but that sort of calls attention to things.Once installed, the result is a good clear picture. This would be good for a small business, or a cabin or home, where a single camera can capture a decent view -- it is not a replacement for an entire home system, and I see that the Q-See people do make 4 camera set-ups, and mock camera set-up, sufficient to cover all areas around a business or home.  This is a good one-off camera, and also works well for creating a way to watch deer and animals out the back of your lot.I will return and comment on whether this stands up to a Minnesota winter.  It works well, and the images are good, and so I like it, after a couple of hours for this all thumbs guy to install it.", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Security Dome Camera", "Author": "Marie Antoinette", "ReviewID": "R288QY4HDA92LH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "When I ordered this product, I made a mistake as I didn't realize that this camera was hard wired.
