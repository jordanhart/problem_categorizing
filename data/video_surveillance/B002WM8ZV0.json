When I got the unit, I checked voltage and polarity at all of the plugs, and everything seemed to be in order so I went ahead.  It seems to work just fine for me, powering (at present) two 250 mA  IR cameras with no issues.I really like the fact that the transformer has a normal power cord and is not a \"wall wart\" style, as it saves room on outlets.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Working perfectly fine for about a month now.", "Author": "S.

Although I was concerned by the previous review, this was the only choice for a 4-way, so I tried it out.  It does have a higher total output than the adaptor that came with my nightowl dvr's cameras, but the voltage is the same 12v.  Always check your camera specs before choosing a transformer.  Some cameras (some PTZ Cameras for example) need 24v, but they often have the transformer included with camera.  Voltage has to be the same on each camera and transformer, but Amps rating of the transformer needs to be equal to or higher than the total amps required by all the cameras you intend to hook up to the transformer.  One last thing, this product doesn't have a UL logo if that bothers you, however it does have the european CE logo.  I believe the previous unfortunate reviewer had some other problem occur as a coincidence when his equipment failed.", "Date": "February 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "very nice!

I needed a power supply with 2 amps of power but most being sold are less expensive and just provide 1 amp. I was happy to find this one being sold at a good price and rated at 2 amps, so I got it. When delivered though, I was disappointed to see the rating on the plug said it was only 1 amp. I didn't test it myself - pulling more power than rated can cause it to overheat. The power supplies have been returned and my money refunded. I am now looking for a true 2A power supply for my project.Maybe there was a temporary problem with the manufacturer or something, just be sure to carefully inspect what is delivered to you. The plug should be rated at 2 amp.Also, I noticed that the 4-to-1 plug converter was a separate octopus-type wire splitter that plugged into the main power supply. It's not exactly how the picture looks. A single wire comes out of the supply and ends in a 2.1mm male plug. The splitter can then be attached.

At night which is when I really need to record I get nothing but black lines up and down and a patch of color static across the screen. I have captured great stuff but hard to see with the lines moving up and down across the screen. I read from different sources that it could be the adapter. I am now in the process of ordering RG59 Siamese cable which is very expensive or ordering another 12V which has great reviews from customers who have the same experience as me. I will another 12V  first if it doesn't work then I will buy the RG59 Siamese cable and will update the results.Bottom line if you have a good camera powerful like mine I would not recommend this.UPDATE: Today may 24 i received the new adapter OMG is amazing..all this time trying to figure out if it was cables or camera ..slowly and gradually narrowed down to the adapter...but today when I received the new adapter and remove this one they sell Voila! no lines great clear picture ...night vision is amazing..just to be fair my camera is powerful though it was only $70 I got it from Amazon because of the reviews ..the best camera!!! but it needed a powerful adapter..here is the adapter i received today in case someone is suffering like I was ,..and it was less money than this one here..just $10 I am going to order more VideoSecu 12V DC 2A 2000mA 100V - 240V AC Regulated Power Supply Adaptor for CCTV Security Camera Home Surveillance System PW2000R 1LCgood luck for those of you Night Vision aficionados", "Date": "May 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Power supply works great.", "Author": "R.

Moon", "ReviewID": "R18VNKGMP8FQFN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I thought this was a great idea so I got it.  It promptly fried 2 cams as I was plugging them in. This power supply (PS) puts all the voltage to a single outlet when plugged in, then divides accordingly per camera, in other words, it doesn't regulate the outputs.  Had I plugged in all 4 cams THEN plugged the PS into the 120 volt outlet, I thinks things would have been okay.  A (PS) unit like this should have its power outputs isolated and regulated, period! Units of higher quality will typically do this.  I have many guitar pedals that run off of a single 9 VDC (PS) similar to this one that do in fact isolate and regulate the way it should be done and I've never had an issue using one or two of 8 or so outputs on pedal costing $100's, some of which are connected to PC based recording equipment. Regardless, when all 4 cams are plugged in, the two 100' (16GA solid copper wires) runs are grossly under powered resulting in poor image quality and the IR will not work at night causing the those cams to go offline unless there is a light source in the field of view of the cam.  With individual PS's, this has simply never been an issue for the past 3 years, (I got this 4 in 1 unit to save outlet space).  Last night, 3 of the 4 cams went offline for no apparent reason and an acrid smell of burning electronics was emanating from the dedicated PC that hosts the cams.  Now I have NO security system and a lot of money up in smoke.  For sure, the DVR is toast and until I can get my system back online, I will not know if the cams survived this. This $19 PS (POS!!) may have just cost me a $1,000 in fried equipment!  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!! Buyer beware!Update 01/04/2012:  Someone commented that it is impossible for the host PC to have been damaged by back-feeding current.  While I agree it is highly unlikely and I'm no electrical engineer, but this setup did in fact fry the USB circuits on the motherboard rendering the $1,800 PC useless until costly MoBo is replaced. I have since done away with that entire configuration and went with a dedicated Linux based 4 port CCTV DVR purchased from Amazon and went back to 4 individual power supplies and have not had one second of down time in the past year.
