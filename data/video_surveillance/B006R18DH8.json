I have thrown away my money before, but this is nuts. The camera doesn't work even though I tried many times to follow the instructions which are in poor English. Don't I repeat don't waste your money on this thing !!! If you want to throw away your money you can sent it to me and get an email thanking you. This is more than what you will get from this piece of trash !!!", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not a happy purchase", "Author": ":-(", "ReviewID": "R27T80OK3EYX5D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Received the product very quickly, however, after trying to use it, powered it for 24 hours to charge the battery, it would not retain its memory and I would have to reset the time (over and over and over).  Product appeared to be very cheaply made, despite it's cost.  Never even got to try whether it made videos or pictures due to the above problem.  Would definitely not recommend.  Return went fairly smoothly though.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disorganisation", "Author": "G.D.GOTT", "ReviewID": "RUXWIA59KA75G", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When I open the unit I've looked for the Owners Manual in order to start it up. My surprise: the Manual inside the box is for a PEN VIDEO RECORDER. Isn't it incredible? Now, here I am in Brazil, where I'll stay working for about 4 months and cannot use the unit because it is very difficult to operate without an Owners Manual. What can I do now?", "Date": "July 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Parts missing, parts wrong, instructions useless", "Author": "W.

Both came with a non US charger even though the seller and the buyer are in the US.  The instructions were written in English words by a non-English speaker, and made no sense.  I emailed back and forth with them and finally got an address to ship them back to.  It wasted a lot of my time, and they told me they \"might\" cover the shipping cost for the return postage.  I don't recommend this seller.", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Motion camera not working", "Author": "Alfredo", "ReviewID": "R3OZANI8UAJQJO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wish I can return this back or exchange.

It worked good as an annoying clock, thats about it.  It was supposed to come with a remote to control and activate the motion activated camera.  However mine didn't, and it wasn't opened before I received it as far as I can tell. It was wrapped and sealed like it was shipped from the factory, yet it didn't have the remote at all. And because of this, it only can be used as a clock that talks the time every hour on the hour.  Thats all I can say", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "motion camera dissapointment", "Author": "lori kimball", "ReviewID": "R2AKUO6SU0GIPZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "the remote sticks to the point your not sure if the camera is working or not.
