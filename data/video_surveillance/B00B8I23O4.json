A wired surveillance system, such as this Lorex, is impractical for large or multi-story homes. The 60ft cable included cables or even optional 120ft cables will not stretch/install easily around the average multi-story home. With the 60ft cables, I decided to install 2 cameras on the top level of my home to monitor the front of my home.The setup is very simple. Each camera has a BNC male connector and a power male connector. The supplied cables have a BNC and Power cable coupled together. You connect the BNC cable to the desired port on the DVR and the other side to the camera. The power to all 4 cameras is supplied through a single power adapter that connects to a splitter. You connect the DVR to a monitor (not included) with a VGA adapter.The power adapters for the DVR and the Camera are designed to be close to the location of the DVR.Once the physical setup is complete, turn on the power and the split screen video comes on.The video quality is good and bright. The colors, however, do not have the right color saturation - even after adjustment. The claimed 50ft vision range in pitch black is really about 25ft. The 480 TVL resolution cameras do not capture sufficient detail for useful surveillance past ~25ft. The range does improve in daylight (50-75ft) but the resolution is not sufficient for surveillance detail past ~50 feet. With my cameras being mounted at the top level of my home, my effective range was till about half my driveway. This is not sufficient for me! I do like the seamless transition from daylight to pitch-black - I did not have any dead/black spots in my recording. The cameras handled it well.The menu is a little archaic, but functional. It took a few attempts, but I figured out the setup and network connections within a matter of minutes. The wi-fi connected instantly without issues (though it did pull an IP without my network password???) The mobile setup was a little more involved and I did not attempt any remote connectivity.I will be looking into a wireless camera system like the Lorex Wireless Video Monitoring System (LW292). It provides the ability to setup cameras at your desired locations without ugly wiring running all over the place.Would recommend for apartments or single-story homes.PROS:* Affordable surveillance system* Picture quality is bright in low light or darkness* Easy hardware setup* Vandal resistant cameras* Compact DVR* Ability to output video on 3 monitors* DVR can send notifications with optional motion sensor cameras* Free mobile iOS, Android & Windows Mobile apps to access/control the DVR remotely* Free mobile iOS, Android & Windows Mobile apps to get a live-view remotely* Software supports Hard Disks upto 2TB - User upgradable* Lots of accessories optionsCONS:* Wired camera system* Camera range is not sufficient to identify subject past 50ft in daylight and 25ft at night* Archaic, slightly difficult to use software* Color reproduction not accurate", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for...", "Author": "Sandor Nemethy", "ReviewID": "R2B71VS5RK9C06", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my 2nd Lorex system, the first one just flat out died about 6 years of owning it.  I figured it ran it's course and thought I'd buy another system, also by Lorex, in hopes of having extra cameras.  Unfortunately, they decided to change the connectors, so I had to dump the entire old system.  I let that one go, in hopes that the \"new\" technology would be better - I was wrong.  I installed the new cameras, setup the system and found many things that would cause me to return the whole system, but it's too much of a headache to breakdown, so I'm settling...1. Per Amazon advertising: \"Connects to 3G/4G or WiFi Network\"... I call B.S. on this.  This was the main reason I got it because I thought the unit had capability to connect to the house WIFI, since my system is in the garage and I didn't have to route a cable to it.  The truth is that it only connects via a cable and what they are referring to is that once you connect the box to the router, you can then download an app to your phone to view your monitors on 3g/4g... I would have immediately crossing this system off my list had I known that going into it.  Again this is something I can get past, but it's more of a headache than anything.2. Nighttime vision:  This is where the cameras have gone backwards in development!!!  The cameras of 6 years ago had such strong IR LEDs that they cameras literally had an ominous red glow to them at night and the nighvision was pretty good.  These do NOT glow red and they barely have any capability to see at night unless there's something directly in front of the camera at 10-20 ft.  I realize IR is not supposed to glow, but whatever type of LEDs they had in those old cameras, the red glow doubled as a great deterrent to anyone looking at the house at night (while they were being filmed).3. Playback capability:  This is BY FAR the worst feature of this system.  The last system I had (again - by the SAME company), had a very simple timeline to highlight all the recorded events of the day.  You just clicked on the event and played it.  On this system, it displays some calendar on the screen and you have to make a request to for which day you want to search the DVR.  Then, it breaks it down into only half hour increments saying that an event (even if it was a minute long) was recorded during that half hour.  Then to watch it, you have to browse thru the whole half hour.  It's horrible... I can only hope that once I have the unit hooked up to the internet, the web browsing capability is where the company spent it's resources rather than the user interface directly on the DVR itself.Would I recommend this unit to a friend?  No, I'd point them to other companies at this point.Would I return this unit if I wouldn't have to remove all of the cameras and remove all of the cables?  Absolutely.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Might be a great product if you can get it to work", "Author": "FPSJunkie", "ReviewID": "R29KX3KB7BFQP4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "UPDATE 20 Dec 2013.  After nearly two weeks of frustration I was finally able to talk to a tech support technician. To make a long story short and to summarize, he basically agreed that the product documentation/manual information on how to set the system up for remote viewing was garbage. Turns out I had managed to forward my ports which he was able to confirm from his end so that was not the issue. Fixing my problem was actually simple. If you are sitting at your house with your WiFi up and running you first look at your DVR settings and make sure you know what IP address your DVR is using. For example say your DVR IP is set to 192.168.2.5. It is important to note that your local IP address is your private non-routable IP address you use for your home network which is not to be confused with your public IP address that is assigned by your ISP that allows you to connect to the Internet. Type your DVR's IP address into the URL window in your browser such as: [...] for example. when you click the return button you will most likely get a blank page which was what was holding me up.  Then in your browser menu click on Tools and look for \"Compatibility View Settings\" and click on that. This will open up another  small window. You should see your IP address in the small box that says \"Add this website\". If not type in your DVR IP address and click add. Once you do that you will be prompted to enter your login info. If you have not changed your default login settings just click the login button. If you have changed your default settings (which you should eventually after you get things up and running correctly) then enter your username and password and then login. You should be able to see your cameras.Note: if you are trying to connect from a remote site away from your home such as from your work computer you will need to type in your public IP address -- the one your ISP has assigned you that I mentioned earlier.  Keep in mind this is a dynamic address which may change. A simple quick way to find out your public IP address while you are at home is to go to Google and search for What is my IP. Click an appropriate link from the search possibilities and you'll see your public IP address (you can also use a command prompt and type ipconfig /all).  You will use this address in your browser to view your cameras from your work computer at the office or whatever.I've raised my opinion of the product to two stars but no more because regardless how good the hardware may be the product is useless if the documentation does not provide the information needed to set it up. NONE of the information the customer support technician told me and/or used to get this thing working correctly was documented in the manual.I purchased a Lorex system directly from Lorex because the 8 channel unit with wireless cameras was not available through Amazon.  Although my Lorex model is not the exact system as the one available at this Amazon location, Lorex uses the same tools to setup and configure this product as the one I have so my review from that perspective is relevant.  I apologize for the length and will update if I eventually figure this thing out before I get so frustrated that I send it back. Meanwhile I wanted to warn customers of potential problems if you choose to buy this product.The main reason I wanted a camera surveillance system was the capability to log in from a remote location such as while I'm on vacation to ensure everything is ok back at home. On paper, the system seems really great. However, the reality of getting it to work can be somewhat challenging which may be an understatement.The hardware, including cameras, seem to be of good quality and work great.  But, in order to view your cameras via a remote pc or mobile device you have to first configure port forwarding using the provided configuration tool.  If you are lucky it may work great and you are on your way. If not so lucky you may be faced with an ordeal similar to mine as follows: (keep in mind I'm giving you more details than perhaps necessary just to show you a true picture of the frustrations you may be faced with.)I unpacked everything and noted that it comes with all cables you will need to connect everything.  Initial setting up of the cameras and DVR is easy. Screw the base to the camera, attach the antenna, and plug it in to an 110v outlet (the wireless camera still needs power to work. The wireless part means you don't need to run cables from the DVR to the camera.)  Next, connect the DVR to the router your Internet Service Provider gave  you via the provided Cat 5 Ethernet cable. After that attach the antenna to the receiver (each camera needs a receiver to pick up the wireless signal from the camera), plug in the ac adapter to a 110v power source, and plug in the RCA jack to the channel of your choice on the DVR. The cameras and receivers come pre-paired with each other from the factory which is a nice touch. No need to do any pairing unless for some reason they lose the pairing.  There are instructions in the troubleshooting guide on how to fix that by re-pairing the camera/receiver if needed.  Lastly, connect the DVR to a monitor or TV of your choice via the supplied HDMI cable, DVI, or RCA jacks. Once the cameras and receivers are all plugged in and connected to the DVR which is connected to your TV/monitor you can power the DVR and you should see the view from your cameras nicely displayed on your monitor.Next, you wade through the 138 page manual you got from the Lorex DVD that came with your system to configure all the recommended settings such as the time, etc.  Again, this is fairly straightforward. Now comes the hard part --setting up the DVR for remote connectivity.First, the manual said to make sure I can view the DVR via the LAN or client software for the pc which is on the enclosed DVD. I followed the instructions closely to make sure I was doing everything right. After ensuring my DVR was connected via the Ethernet cable to my router, they said to browse through the DVR settings (remember, this thing is already up and running for viewing on my TV) and note the DVR IP address and http port. Next open a browser - make sure you use the 32 bit version of IE because it doesn't support the 64bit version - and enter the ip address and port like this: [...] for example. You're supposed to then get a prompt to install ActiveX plug-in which did not happen.  I try going to that socket (an IP address plus a port is a socket) anyway for grins and got nothing. Blank page. Maybe that's a good thing since Active X is dangerous security-wise.  So, no luck with this part. Next, I tried the other method of installing the Lorex Client 11. That did work and I can see my DVR and camera views on my PC. Hurray!I'm encouraged so now I go on to the next phase of setting this thing up so I can see it over the Internet. The instructions say in bold print, \"To set up remote connectivity with your DVR, you must: 1) Port forward the HTTP, Client, and Mobile ports (default 80, 9000, and 1025) on your router to your DVR's IP address. 2) Create a DDNS account. 3) Enable DDNS on the DVR. 4) Test the remote connection by entering your DDNS address in a web browser. \" Phew!It doesn't tell you at this point but you have to set up DDNS first which is fairly easy. Had no problems with that.  Basically they want you to register for your warranty and they provide a link to set up DDNS when you do that.Now for the show stopper - port forwarding which if you can't get it to work, you're hosed.You install and run the \"Lorex Easy Connect Auto Port Forwarding Wizard\" which is very ironic in that it would actually be easy if it actually worked. In a nutshell It's supposed to run a diagnostic to find your routers; you select the correct version from a dropdown box if it's not already there; input your DVR IP and ports you want to forward; click the button to update the router; and finally click another button to test it. Good luck getting that far without errors.  Note: the product seems to favor Linksys routers in that it may recognize and configure that brand automatically without issue. (I'm supposed to trash my Belkin and buy a Linksys?)Backtracking a bit for more details of my ordeal. You install the wizard from the DVD. Ensure you have the most current version and update if needed.  Clicking the Start button sends you on your way. It first does a diagnostic to find your router or routers if you have more than one -- or it thinks you do.  Therein lies the first problem. If it thinks you have more than one router you have to fix that problem if you can actually figure out how.  I have my ISP provided ARRIS brand router and I also have a Belkin router I use for my WiFi.  The port forwarding wizard noted I had two routers and said I had to configure one of them in a DMZ before I could continue. Keep in mind that as detailed as this is I'm actually skipping a lot of stuff.  I danced around that issue all day Saturday trying this and that to get it to work without success.Adding insult to injury. The configuration wizard is actually an application from a 3rd party called pcwintech.com which has a hot link on the wizard tool that invited me to go to the pcwintech website for more information. I did, was really tired by then, and while browsing the forums there managed to fast click on a link that immediately downloaded and installed a tool bar I did not want and hijacked my browser to a search engine I did not want either.  Now I had to spend time uninstalling that and run scans to see what malware may have come with it because I assumed I most likely managed to pick up a Trojan. Great.  Fortunately, I was able to uninstall the toolbar and my anti-virus tools did not pick up anything else.  Nevertheless, what a great way to anger and frustrate someone trying to find help using a provided link embedded in the product.Next morning on Sunday I called my ISP tech support to see why I was getting an invalid IP address error when I tried putting my number 2 router in the DMZ. I mean we're talking about a standard private class C 192.168.x.x IP address. After remoting into it he discovered there were some errors in the default configuration from the factory that should have been changed before it was issued to me. He fixed that and the next time I ran the port forwarding wizard I was optimistic things would finally work. Not so. The wizard now found only one router which is my Belkin but low and behold my specific Belkin model is not listed in the available choices from the drop down list.  I tried selecting one just one version number off from mine but it would not configure with the wizard. Guess it's got to be the exact one because the router update would not complete without errors. Or, I've overlooked or misconfigured something else.So now I'm at a stalemate. I very cautiously go back to Pcwintech.com out of pure desperation and the webmaster invites me to send screenshots of every single page of my router configuration via a very complicated method for him to add my router to a future updated list but do you think I'm going to trust this guy with screenshots of my network configuration via an insecure link (http vs https) especially after a link on his website installed that toolbar and hijacked my browser?  No. I think not. Even if I did, I wonder how long before the configuration tool would be updated so I could find my router in the list?  Days? Weeks? Months?Last resort is to call Lorex tech support which is the first thing I would have done if they were open on Sat or Sun. (Plus I'm 5 time zones away from them.)  I will try and hopefully perhaps a technician there can get me through this. Otherwise everything goes back into the box and back to them for a refund. I'm tired of messing with something that should be fairly simple to configure with adequate instructions. I mean, c'mon I was able to configure my Cisco Pix 515 firewall after a few minutes reading a book I have on Cisco firewalls from Cisco Press.  How hard can it be to set up a surveillance system? Apparently very.In summary, it may be a great product for anyone able to get it to work.

I am doing an update to this review since I have been given very detailed customer support from the team in Lorex regarding a problem that I reported to their ticket system. As It turned out, I had changed some settings that badly affected the system's ability to make backups and I couldn't make a backup. I had a great response from their  customer service after I got their attention. My thanks and deep appreciation for their special attention to the problem I was experiencing. One thing that I still don't like is that they close the tickets without verifying that the problem had a solution. I say this because I am used to other systems,  TechSmith for example, maker of  several computer programs  that i have used in the past and present and all their tickets are closed once the user tells them that they implemented a solution and it solved the problem. i think they should wait for this to happen or investigate more.What can I say about the hardware? I am very satisfied with the quality of the video and the capabilities of the software to personalize the experience. An  8 camera system like this gets a big area covered with sharp and detailed LIVE video with the ability to review past recordings and make backups to USB. It also has the capability to set alarms, set motion detection, black out some areas so they don't appear on the monitor (though they are recorded) .

Lorex overstates the low-light performance of the cameras a bit, but it's serviceable (the user will probably want to experiment a bit to find the 'sweet spot' of low-light performance).Setup isn't as intuitive as it could have been, due primarily to unclear literature and software that isn't terribly user-friendly. However, once it's up and running, it DOES actually work as advertised. The mobile monitoring is pretty cool, and although the motion detection is hit-or-miss, email notification works as advertised. I've not had to deal with Lorex customer service or technical support, so I can't speak to that aspect of the product.In my estimation, prospective buyers need to consider two things:1.) The cameras are NOT wireless, so you WILL need to consider the logistics of running cable from the cameras to the control box2.) This is not a high-end security system- it's a low-end monitoring system. That means that things like software-side maintenance, etc., are the user's responsibility. Don't set this up, forget about it for six months, then get upset because it didn't automatically retain and catalog all your footage for the previous six months.Having said all that, it's a reasonably priced monitoring system that, for the most part, works and performs as promised.", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exccelent", "Author": "Fernando A.

Wire ports in the back center of the brackets allow for the wire to be completely inside the camera and casing body which is good for low mounts where a wire could be easily damaged or cut. Wire provided was 'fine' but a little short for one long run to the back door. The DVR casing was sturdy and because of remote viewing is great to hide in rafters or under a cupboard. Daytime video is great, and for a system of this price the IR works surprisingly well.Now my thoughts:I really like the remote viewing capability on this system. From work or in my car I can use my android phone to see who is in the driveway, whether my husband is home or not, or what time my Amazon.com delivery came. I also like that if anything is ever out of place outside we can have video to help figure out what happened. It is kind of strange to see my own house at night on security camera footage but so far all we have recorded is a family of deer and countless racoons. Hopefully that is exciting as our security footage will get.Overall: Solid sturdy hardware, great video recording, low end price.", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Many different prices to choose from...", "Author": "slim \"57psalm\"", "ReviewID": "R38M0518406O7F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "You know that saying \"You get what you pay for\"? It appears that the more you are willing to spend on this product and its many variations, the more features and the better quality you get.I have the 4-camera model.  We thought it would be nice to hook it up to our TV so we can simply flip to it during commercials while watching TV.  Here are some things to know:It does NOT come with RCA cables. We had to buy connectors so we could use the existing cables with our RCA inputs and then it worked fine.Each camera has about 50 feet of cord.The navigation menu(s) are rather confusing. Some don't work constistently like the other menus, making things worse.  Eventually we figured out how to get from choice to choice, and select certain choices, but there were still some quirks that made it quite frustrating.The camera quality is ok at best. Colors are often faded and not like what the human eye sees, or it goes to black and white with IR mode.It switches automatically between color and IR mode, which is fantastic.  It seems to use IR mode in relatively light conditions.We were able to use the DVR in motion detector-mode. We pointed a camera at a nesting bird, and set it to record just when motion was detected.  It worked great, from what we can tell!  We were able to see the bird sit on its nest, fly out, fly in, feed, and cough up leftover pellets.  At close range (a few feet) the resolution was pretty good, but not crystal clear.The video format isn't compatible with any of our other video programs (like Corel) though.

I tested it in a few computers and different operating system. Well, the only two OS supported by it, Windows and Mac.At the end, I uninstalled it and settled for using a direct connection to the DVR with a monitor and the included mouse. For remote access, I recommend using the ActiveX controls application that installs directly into Internet Explorer or Safari when one tries to access the DVR using a local network. That is in my opinion the best way to manage this DVR from a distance. I like the options of no having the DVR recording all the time, but being able to start to record with single click. Also, it's great the feature of taking snapshots and store them into the hard drive of the computer that is accessing the DVR from a distance.An administrator account is set by default, it doesn't come with a password, but I suggest that the first thing you do is setting one. Also, a few users can be created with different level access to the cameras and DVR remotely. The only setback to this, is that even if the users are forbidden from using all the features, they can still see those features available. Like I said, the software needs to be improved. I hope it does, because this company is offering a great hardware product at an affordable price.In the box it comes almost everything needed to set the surveillance, from plastic screw holders for the cameras to a USB mouse.The 60' feet long wires included with each camera are good enough for the average business or home size. But the black wires are an announcement of where to cut in order to disable the cameras, so those wires must be hidden. Putting them thru a wall is a good solution, but a truly hard task. In the end, I settled and placed them inside 1/2 inch PVC pipes, all along the ceiling, right where the wall and the ceiling meet. Since the pipes are the same color of the walls, they blend well, and it would take someone really perceptive to guess what they are for, at a simple glance.The cameras work great both during the day and night. Indeed, I was surprised of how well the night vision works. I think that this system is a good option for a small business, and/or a big household. If one has a home business, this is perfect, two cameras can be used to watch the business and the rest to surveil the house.Finally, I noticed that the DVR gets hot after a few hours of operation, in spite of the case having many tiny slots carved in for air circulation. This heating is a bad thing in the long run, because circuits and heat don't mix. Eventually the heat will destroy the circuits and shorten the life of the machine. The only way to prevent that outcome is pointing a desktop fan at the DVR to cool it down. I know it sounds unsophisticated, but it works, and it's a economical solutions that would extend the life of the product. The DVR comes with two USB ports, 5 Volts DC each, so even a USB powered desk fan might work without adding an extra energy cost.", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "entry-level security camera system adequate for its target audience", "Author": "fatmav", "ReviewID": "R2PWMDL7B4HT1E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Courtesy the Amazon Vine program, I received this Lorex Vantage 4-channel DVR with 4 cameras pack for review. Think of this as a digital video recorder shipped with a 500GB harddrive (user upgradable), plus four wired, reasonably good quality integrated color (day vision) & IR (night vision) wall-mountable camera that you can hook up to the DVR for recording.We installed this in a friend's house. The setup was uneventful, other than the fact that we must find a good location for the DVR to work around the length of the cables, which are about 60 feet in length. Do not underestimate how much cable you need---to neatly route the cables around the walls, you need extra. (Otherwise you end up with wires in the air... not exactly a good idea.) After we settled on the location of the DVR, the mounting was extremely quick, and so is the software installation. It took less than two hours for the two of us to get everything running, and then the slightly disappointing realization comes when we turned on the system.This is an entry-level system. While we certainly did not expect cinema quality footage, the color video is quite washed out and blurry by any modern standard. In our opinion, it literally is worse than the cameras on our iPhone during broad daylight. We double checked to see if we left some oil/dirt on the camera. No. I think this is a case of you get what you paid for.Once the night comes the cameras automatically switched to IR mode. The specification states a 50 feet range in pitch black. I really have no idea how they got that number unless they mean objects that are specifically designed to reflect IR. We live in a city, and so we never reach really pitch black. Still, other than the head & tail lights and the surprisingly bright car plates, you would not be able to tell that there were cars driving down the road once the sun has completely set.The software in the DVR system is, in our opinion, easy to use even though admittedly very ugly. As for the major selling point of the system, namely the ability to monitor and review footage on a mobile device, we found it to be functional but the vanity wears off very quickly on us.Overall, I have to agree that this is a working system for entry-level surveillance needs. The only thing I wish is wireless connection. I see that Lorex does make a wireless model, but it is over twice the price of this one...

If it weren't for a cumbersome software setup process and the lack of wireless connectivity, this would be a five star product.This unit contains all the cords you will need for setup.  All four of the cameras are easy to hook up to the unit which is routed through your monitor.  I didn't have any issues hooking up the hardware to my computer and monitor, and can't imagine many others will either.  The cords might be a bit small for some with a very large home, so look into what you need before purchasing.Once I got the cameras up and running through my monitor, I found that pictures were bright and colorful, but the stated range might be a bit lacking.  It states you have a 50 foot range in the dark, but it my experience it was closer to 30 feet.  Still, the pictures in both light and dark were sufficient up to this range, and luckily for me I don't need much more with my home.The coolest features for me is its remote routing feature which allows you to work the unit with a wireless device.  I use an iPhone 4 to work my cameras, and everything functions with no lags or problems at all.As I mentioned before, this unit requires cords to work which in this day and age baffles me to no end.  This was the biggest issue I had in setting this unti up, as well.  Once you start coiling up wires around your house (which will probably be too short for most), you're going to start wondering if you really need this model that badly.  This needs to be wireless, pure and simple.  The ethernet cord is also extremely short, like a couple of feet and that's it.  You can always use your own, but why should you have to?  Lorex needs to include much longer connectivity cords with this package.  Also, the software is badly conceived and cumbersome to navigate.  I understand this is a small company and designing software may not be the top of their to-do list, but it's pretty antiquated and annoying to use.Having said this, the unit performs as advertised, and I haven't experienced any technical difficulties yet.

First of all, there are items that are not included in the set that will be needed such as a 15 pin VGA cable or a BNC terminated cable.  Another annoyance was that all the chords are very short!  The 2 power chords (one for the cameras and the other for the digital recorder) are only ~ 3 feet long.  Plus the head of each power chord is a large rectangle size that does not easily fit on a strip.  Also, the Ethernet Cable a mere 3 feet, too!

My last quibble is that for some reason I thought this system was wireless.
