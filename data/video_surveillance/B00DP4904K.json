Quick test of the cables on the camera system proved they worked as expected (same/better than the 60' cables that came with the system), and give me the flexibility of installing some of the cameras at distances greater than what the 60' cables included with my camera system would allow.  Great product!", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "good quality cables", "Author": "Walter O.

I was very satisfied with the product and delivery. The 4 security camera project is complete and the cameras are performing as well with the longer cables as the ones on the 60 foot stock cables.", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$38.00", "Features": "High Quality Video Power Cables\nIncludes Coupler to link cables", "Name": "Generic SEA-C101 2x BNC 100ft Cable with 2x Female to Female Coupler for Security Samsung Products", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41nGZAXcp-L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DP4904K"}}
