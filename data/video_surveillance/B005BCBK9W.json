{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Cheap But Risky", "Author": "Tim D.", "ReviewID": "R328KP1LU36NHA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought these modulators based on the good reviews here.  The first one was to replace an existing modulator that I had that stopped working.From some of the reviews it's clear that some people are confused about what a cable video modulator is or does (but admittedly the title of this item \"...RF Signal Modulator...\" is misleading).Cable video modulators are fed a composite video source and are connected to the coaxial cable of an existing cable TV system.  The modulator is then set to modulate the composite input video onto a cable channel that you can tune in on any TV hooked to the cable system.  In other words, you create your own cable TV channel on your coaxial cable.I've run several different model digital video modulators for years (including Netmedia Triple Play modulators and Sunrise agile modulators to name just a couple I have in service currently).  I use them to broadcast security cameras and DVRs that are located in different buildings on my property over my cable so I can watch the cameras on any of my TVs.So I'm already modulating several different channels on the system that I'm adding the Nyrius modulators to.I was attracted by the price of these modulators - they're half the price of other name-brand (i.e. Channel Plus and Netmedia) single channel modulators.The first thing I noticed about the Nyrius modulator is that it doesn't seem to have a very strong signal output.  That means they require an amplifier on the output for them to work on my system at all.  (That may be due in part to the other video channels I'm modulating on that cable too - I don't know.)After initially buying one of these modulators and using it, I later bought two more and put one of them into use (with an amplifier on the output).However, not long after hooking up the second modulator I found that the signal output would periodically degrade to the point of being un-viewable.  I ran it for a while before swapping it with the third.  When that worked OK I returned the other modulator as defective.  But within a week the other modulator was manifesting the same problem.  Unfortunately by that time my 30 days to return the item had come and gone, so I was stuck with it.The first modulator is still running OK (with its weak signal output however).  But that means that 2 out of 3 modulators I got were apparently defective.Maybe I was just unlucky, or maybe these modulators aren't compatible with the other modulators I've got running on my coax, but based on the weak signal and modulation problems I experienced I can't recommend these modulators, despite the price.", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Well-designed, channel-selectable RF modulator for NTSC TV", "Author": "Lee by the Sea", "ReviewID": "R1J2QLX3SBUR4A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "An \"RF modulator for NTSC television\" takes analog video and sound signals and puts them onto a television channel in the old North American analog signal format.  That's useful even in the digital television era since many DTV sets accept them.  With a modulator you can take the video and sound from (for example) a Roku box, give it a special channel, and add it to your off-the-air DTV signals.  Most RF modulators will only put signals on channel 3 or 4 but you may need more flexibility; Nyrius provides that flexibility.  It puts your signal on any channel from 14 to 69 with the push of a button.  (It also can create the \"CATV\" channels.)  A display shows you the channel.  Be sure to read the mini-manual that comes with the Nyrius; mine was preset to the \"CATV\" channels, so I had to switch it to 14-69 before my TV could see the signal.  (Making that change may be the only time you will use its power switch.) Conveniently, the Nyrius has a built-in signal combiner; just put the off-the-air signal into the input F-connector and take the combined signal from the output connector.  While the Nyrius includes a left and right audio input, I suspect it combines those sound signals into NTSC mono audio since the manual says nothing about stereo.  It uses a separate small 12-volt, 250 mA plug-in power supply.  I tested my Nyrius from channel 14 through 83; picture and sound were fine on all channels.  Altogether, a solid product at a good price.", "Date": "April 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Security cam and over the air signal integration.", "Author": "Peter Z.", "ReviewID": "R11O9BMED8GIZK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Worked as described. I used it to combine  feed  from a security DVR with 4 cameras  to an over the air feed  in my house. Device comes pre-setup to a cable tv mode, but instructions to change in to the over the air mode are simple and in the included manual. I had to find a channel with the least interference to get a clear picture which in my area happened to be 60. I can see this device be used for other  applications, but if you work from home, and  looking to see security feed on your existing tv, this should do the trick.", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works great!

My old dish receiver had this feature built in, but not the new ones.  I was able to use the Nyrius NRFM100 Universal Channel RF Signal Modulator Audio/Video Converter with UHF/CATV Mode for satellite/cable TV set-top-box, DVD, surveillance camera to take the composite video out and modulate it onto the TV channel of my choice to avoid interference.  I had to try a few different channels before I got the best picture.  Sure, its not HD, but I knew it wouldn't be.  But the picture quality is good and nobody has complained.  I would definitely recommend this and have thought about getting a second one for the output of my appletv so I can share it to another TV.

With the ability to modulate over the low as well as the high channels, this was an excellent choice from a price and performance standpoint.  With many plug-in devices allowing only channel 3 or 4 interfaces, that problem is gone with this Nyrius model.  I used this modulator to send my DirecTV signal from a media room to a bedroom down the hall and used an Infrared to IR transmitter to control the DirecTV receiver in the media room.  Take the DirecTV controller to bed, tune into channel 17, and my guests have full DirecTV to go to sleep by!

I have a second one of these which I take the composite video and audio from a Roku, set that one to channel 79 so now I have the Roku on all of the TV's in my house on channel 79!What makes this cool is the ability to modulate to pretty much any TV channel you have that may be unused on your system - not limited to channel 3 or 4 like almost all of the other RF modulators out there.All the bad reviews I read on this seemed to be from people that really didn't know what this product was for, including one guy who expected this to transmit a TV signal over the air to other TV's in his house.  Its not a transmitter or a poor man's TV station.Nyrius,  if you are reading this, PLEASE make a hi-definition version of this product.
