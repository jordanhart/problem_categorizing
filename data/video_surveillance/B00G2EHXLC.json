{"Reviews": [{"Title": "More or less works, but useless", "Author": "jcoate", "ReviewID": "RARZLINDAXKBC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Tried out the camera realizing it was low-cost ($60), but beyond basic cheapness the infrared lighting produces a visible red glow at night, making camera location obvious!Less surprising given the cost is that the motion alarm feature only picks up people close to camera. The alarm (e-mail or FTP trigger) often trips on changes in lighting, especially as the low winter sun comes into the lens mid-day. It also keeps restarting mid-day. I enabled the feature to have it e-mail me it's IP address when starting up which is a handy feature, but it would restart and send me 10 to 100 e-mails each day with the IP which gets annoying.As with other budget products the directions are minimal. I configured it without too much trouble but I'm a network guy so stuff like IP addresses and port forwarding is nothing new to me.Only redeeming news is that it worked out of the box and had decent picture quality.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$105.99", "Features": "IR-Cut filter for true color video image\nEnhanced Night Vision for low ambient light\nSupport optional IR LED OFF and external IR illumination\nMotion Detection with email and FTP alarm notification\nWiFi 802.11 b/g/n, WPA2 Encryption Supported", "Name": "Avacom M1080W Wireless Outdoor Camera with Enhanced Night Vision and IR-Cut filter, 2.8mm Lens (Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41f8lkOZoJL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00G2EHXLC"}}
