{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Please DO NOT BUY this camera", "Author": "W. Design", "ReviewID": "R8SGNDIZYITIK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First I have to say I am AMAZED at how this camera has 4 stars. It is the only reason I felt compelled to write a review. I have purchased 9 different cameras in the last 2 months. The only way this camera has such a high rating is that they paid a bunch of their employees or friends to give this camera 4 and 5 stars. This camera was by far the worst out of the 9 cameras I tried. I didn't get a lemon, read the reviews carefully. Skip all of the positive reviews. You can throw a dart against any results for outdoor ip camera on Amazon and you will be doing better than if you pick this camera. This camera is below sub par. The night vision is unusable. The halo created around the image is horrible!!! The image is just barely visible. The camera resets frequently. I thought it was because the camera was on wifi. I purchased the top of the line repeater. I have a $180 router. It still dropped the connection at least once a day. When it resets it goes back to a position that you can not control. I tried direct connecting the camera and guess what??? Yes the camera still dropped connection (even though every other camera has worked flawlessly when direct connected). There are much better options, a well trained pigeon would be a better option. I just purchased the Loftek Sentinel Wireless Pan/tilt 3xzoom Waterproof Outdoor&indoor; Dome Camera and it is a much better camera for $30 less. It does everything this camera does without the night vision. If you have night lights you don't need the night vision. If night vision is such a big option with pan and tilt buy the Foscam FI8910W Wireless/Wired Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with IR-Cut Filter for True Color Images - 8 Meter Night Vision and 3.6mm Lens (67\u00b0 Viewing Angle) - Black NEWEST MODEL and put it in a spot where it wont get wet or build a housing for it. The screws in this camera are horrible, they are small like the ones you find in sunglasses and you will strip them or their inserts when you try and remove the dome to focus this camera. The camera comes completely out of focus. There is no firmare upgrades. The technical support and forum answers on their website are laughable. Loftek Nexus 543 Outdoor Wireless/wired Waterproof Ip Camera is a better camera even though it is a fixed camera and much cheaper but the winner in my opinion is Shark $400 or Trivision (a Shark clone) for about $100 less. Whatever you do, do not buy this camera. You will decide that this is a paper weight that you should have returned weeks ago instead of trying to get it to work. You will check your return period. It will have expired. You will be angry and sad.", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Agasio A622W", "Author": "Mr TV", "ReviewID": "R1X5JFNUTVZ7XK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The camera itself isn't bad during daylight hours.The functioning / software of the camera leaves a lot to be desired.The box the camera came in is labeled PTZ.

I can't really understand why they're NOT using 802.11n wireless, not only for the range but the speed.  The second issue is that the IR emitters at night actually reflect back into the dome glass and make the view a rather fuzzy, and useless rendition of whatever the camera is pointing at.Setup was actually very easy, but as a network engineer you'd expect that.  I could see an average person struggling with the setup.  We have 6 other IP cameras by various vendors from Trendnet to Zmodo.  This is the first supposed all weather camera we've mounted in the \"elements\" of Minnesota.Any kind of optical zoom would have been nice, but it doesn't have it, and not even the digital zoom works in the Agasio Internet explorer control page, nor from our tablets using Foscam settings.The low light sensitivity is actually pretty nice.  The camera quality is average at best, and oddly, the whole glass dome turns when using 360 pan.  I can't see that holding up in the winter, and it's mind boggling why you'd have a weather enclosed dome camera, but choose to turn the glass dome instead of the camera mounting inside the dome.  Weird.Three stars is generous, and largely just due to price.  BTW - its actually a pretty big unit, so be prepared for that.", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Real world results for this camera", "Author": "T. Currie", "ReviewID": "R28H3BMXOLK2GD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This product works well, if you do these things....1. Use the wired connection to configure it if you intend to use it via wireless. Very simple to configure if you have basic skills adding things to your Wireless Network, or can read a manual and guess.2. The built-in web admin page is nearly useless , download Mozilla to configure this cam, skip Internet Explorer, it isn't worth the hassle to bypass the IE security since their Active-x object is unsigned.3. If you have a Synology, you need to choose the Foscam 8910W camera (works great), Agasio is NOT a Mfr. in their list. works great with Surveillance Station/DS Cam4. If you use Android, you will need to get \"IP Camviewer Basic\" (unless you have Synology), free from the store.5. If you use Apple devices, you will want \"Livecams Pro\" from the store (unless you have Synology), this is $1.99 (this product actually does multi-cam view and will take you to cameras all over the globe, bonus!)The above was discovered by fiddling and calling support, nothing in the manual will help you with this important info... which makes no sense at all.  It comes with software that finds the camera on your network, and launches you to the awful admin page.The night vision inside was way cool, outside you do have the halo effect mentioned in other reviews, unless the IR can bounce off of something like your house. This produces an outstanding image at night. Out in the open yard, halo, but you still get great picture in the center and you can see clearly out to 35 feet or so. If you could bounce the IR, it might do better at greater distance (I can't test that). For this price, you have no right to expect the image in daylight to be better than it is, excellent price/performance in my opinion. The P/T works properly, but the device randomly resets itself to \"home posistion\" overnight, no way to change home in the interface and telling it not to in the interface does not stop it. The housing is metal, and seems to be very sturdy. This device uses a wall wart power supply and has an ethernet jack on the power cord that is not small, which presents a problem in the average exterior plug box. I had to get a double gang all weather box and extension cord, the power cord isn't very long, you might want to buy these with the camera.Overall, for the price, the housing is great, the day and night images are great, the tech support was good, called back with correct answers (my request) within an hour I think.  The manual, included software, and the web interface are terrible, the halo thing is dumb but does not bother me.  This cam was easy for me to configure, but it wasn't my first rodeo.  I have a Panasonic BL-C230 PTZ, the 2 products are not equal (nor are the prices or the overall spit and polish).  I have yet to configure the triggers/alarms, but will update this if they do not work.If you think all those reviews with 5 stars are not from the company trying to boost the ratings, you might be too easily impressed by reviews. I would just say that I have no idea what the support guys name was, and cannot imagine why I would care, he got me answers though. I am a technology geek and I don't like crappy electronics.  This is not a \"5 Star\" product, but neither does it have a \"5 Star\" price and I will be keeping it...

It works well, no issues out of the box, setup was just like any other ip cam: get it set up on your network, access it's setup page via a browser on your local lan, and voila. Everything as expected, but the users manual is electronic on the CD provided in the box. I bought this as an outdoor, wifi, nightvision ip cam with pan and tilt. It is working great inside, I have not yet set it up outside to determine how reliable and waterproof it is. I use the Blue Iris software to monitor all my ip cams in one window, set up alerts, and provide web acess to all the feeds. Blue Iris did not have a setting for the A622W, but selecting the A601W worked, just FYI. It seems rugged and well built.The only thing I do not like is the all in one cable that is hard wired to the camera. The reset button, power, and wired netwok all use a single cable that has 3 connectors on one end that is hard wired to the internals of the camera. I will use this over wifi, so I don't need the bulk of the thick cable and wired LAN connector, but it cannot be removed and makes mouting it to the wall difficult as the tangle of cable/connectors doesn't quite fit in the small recess on the mounting plate.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worked for 10 minutes, then dead, dead, dead...", "Author": "Phil Ciccone", "ReviewID": "R1H5E2B1MF7JA3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As others have posted, similar experiences here.

I suppose a properly designed outdoor camera that advertises use for nighttime should have the IR lights OUTSIDE the dome!! It appears that Agasio is really Foscam, or has purchased Foscam's software as the interface is *nearly* the same. UPDATE: Second camera arrived.

It looks and feels well made.  The picture both in daylight and a night is satisfactory for all my needs.  On the needs improvement side of the equation, the WebUI is buggy and inconsistent like the other Agasio cameras I have bought.  Two of the cameras had to be returned for replacements because of failing or missing functionality.  The A622W works but it is missing the manufactures DDNS (gipcam).  Instead, the setting is populated with Chinese DDNS sites that don't seem to work from the U.S.  Also, even though the A622W has LEDs for night vision, there is no way to turn them On/Off like on the other Agasio cameras (even though the setting for IR on the A612 I have returns an \"Error Unsupport\" message).  When I contacted support (through email, since I can't get them to answer my phone calls) they gave me a short response with a link to the manual for the product which has NO mention of the LEDs.  The best I can say about the manual is that it is obviously a work in progress.  Most of the figures shown in the manual do not match any of the Agasio cameras I have.  When I've contacted support about other errors in the software, the standard response is to update the WebUI.  However, the latest version of the WebUI is not on the website for many of the products.  You can only tell what version of the WebUI is on the website by downloading and installing it on the camera since they don't bother to publish it on the website.  Twice I have put older versions of the WebUI on cameras that shipped with newer versions of this software.  Neither time did it resolve the issues I was having.UPDATE:  4 out of 5 of the Agasio Cameras that I bought have now failed and had to be returned for replacement (Two of these cameras were replacements for the Agasio cameras I originally bought that failed...now the replacements have failed in a matter of weeks.  Agasio charges the customer shipping (both directions) for a camera that fails outside of 14 days.  Also, you have to pay for shipping a DOA unit directly back to Agasio.  They claim they will reimburse shipping charges for DOA units but they have not.  My recommendation is to avoid Agasio cameras because the quality is bad, really bad.  I've wasted so much time and money putting these cameras up, taking then down, boxing up and continually shipping these cameras back to Agasio (and as I said previously, at my expense!)", "Date": "July 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poor night performance", "Author": "Buddy", "ReviewID": "R2APUK7U5DKE0I", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This was purchased mainly for night time use.

The camera also resets itself several times per day and then pans itself away from where you set it (like into a wall). The interface on the camera only works \"ok\" with Internet Explorer, but even then many functions don't work. It tries to install and ActiveX component, and even if you allow it it will not work.  It is probably better to spend more on a reliable camera than this unless you only need very limited viewing or have good lighting at night.

The picture is good, the pan and tilt work fine and the night vision is excellent.  There was some reflection of the IR LEDs off of the plastic dome but it was negligible in my opinion.  The housing is pretty solid and looks nice, almost like an outside light. Physically and mechanically, this is a great camera for the price.  I would give it 5 stars but for the manual and the software interface which are both abysmal.  The manual I rec'd was not for the camera I bought.  Set up was similar but not the same.  I'm fairly savvy with networking and routers so I was able to get it running after about 30 minutes but someone who was not computer-minded would likely have a very difficult time trying to figure out what's going on.  The interface depicted in the manual and the one that comes with the camera are also completely different and many of the buttons in the software do not work (IR LEDs, etc).  Worse is that, things are described in the manual that you really have to work at to figure out in the interface.  That being said, it is possible to figure it out and now that it's up and running, I've had no problems with it, other than one reboot.  I guess I'd say that if you're tech-savvy and you don't mind the steep learning curve, this is a very good camera for the price.UPDATE:  Well, after using this for the better part of a year, I have to downgrade my recommendation.  While the CCD hardware is still in good shape (bright, well-detailed picture) the wireless hardware and perhaps the power systems have degraded significantly.  Shortly after I posted my initial recommendation, I started having issues with reboots.  For no apparent reason, the camera would shut down and restart.  The restart was immediate so it was kind of like a power cycle but I have no idea as to why this would happen.  It could happen at any time of the day or night and there was nothing obvious to blame it on.  Since it did reboot immediately, it was more of an annoyance than anything else and it seems to have leveled off to happening once or twice a month.  The more important issue is the wireless.  About 2 months after I purchased it, I noticed I wasn't getting a picture.  At first I thought it was another reboot, but after looking at the camera, I could see it was working, I just wasn't getting a signal.  I tried connecting it directly to my ethernet and then I got a picture.  So I fiddled with the antennae, checked all of the connections and rebooted.  Still nothing.  Finally, I went into the software and re-entered all of the info for my local net and rebooted again - it worked!  Since then, this has happened 3 times and each time, the only fix I've found is to re-enter the network data.  Again, this is more of an annoyance than anything else (now that I know what to do) but, with the other issue, it's resulted in a lowering of my recommendation.  Hopefully, with the newer cameras, these issues will be fixed, but until then, I'd have to say - stay away from this model", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Camera sends an email on IP change, very easy to setup.", "Author": "Frank J Liptak", "ReviewID": "RBV8XT7AFRRYJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works well in my application which is monitoring a retreat building 800 miles away which has a network connection of course.I do not use the Wifi connection, it is hard wired to a router.The Camera sends an email on IP change and works well since it is not a fixed IP and I do not have a DDNS service setup.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hard to set up and motion sensor does not work", "Author": "Rockntractor", "ReviewID": "R312C8VXOHETDD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After three weeks of fooling with it we finally got it online but motion sensor does not work.

The glare from the IR LEDs was not too bad...just a faint halo around the edges, and the daylight color was very true to life. But after a couple of days, it kept dropping off my wireless network. The only way to get it back was to disconnect the power, then reconnect it. I replied to the email from Foscam about my purchase, and told them about this. They told me to try changing channels and move the camera closer to the router. This helped for about a day and a half. Then it dropped off the network again. So I ran a temporary network cable out to the camera. The next morning, it was off the network again. I checked the list of attached devices in my router software, and the camera was listed as connected, but It would not show up in the camera software. Also, when I clicked on the \"Audio\" icon, all I would get was a loud buzz. I returned the camera to Amazon for a refund and ordered a new one. The second one worked great the first day. But the next day, it was stuck in the IR mode, with a black & white picture that would constantly flash, as it was getting too much light for IR mode. I tried resetting the camera, which erased all my wireless network programming, and changed everything back to factory default, but it was still stuck in IR mode. Also, I could get no audio out of this one. I may just have gotten a couple of lemons, but I didn't want to chance trying another one, so I just returned the second one for a refund, then I ordered a \"Loftek Sentinel D3 4-9mm 3x Optical Zoom Lens Outdoor Waterproof Wireless Pan/tilt Night Vision Dome Camera with Ir-cut Off Filter, Auto-iris\".

Over the past 10 years I've owned more than a dozen network cameras. Today I have eight running at home and my parents place. I have had some bad cameras in the past and some great ones! So far this camera has worked extremely well.Installation:I mounted the camera on the corner of my house in under 30 minutes, ran the Ethernet cable with external power over Ethernet adaptors and had it up and running in under an hour. Although this unit is wifi capable I always run cameras on Ethernet as its much more reliable. In addition, you need to power the unit so why not kill two tasks as the same time and run power over the Ethernet.About the Camera (Physical):  The camera itself is built from solid material. The dome will swivel around to the required spot and by undoing the 3 nuts at the top it will allow you to remove dome enough allowing you to get your drill into place to screw & mount the arm against a wall.  Once installed, the dome can be then screwed back into the elbow at the top. The camera and IR inside the dome are mounted very flush against the glass so there is no reflection of the IR off the glass back into the camera. Many other cameras have this problem! The camera makes very little noise when it's being moved. The IR sensors create a very small red glow in the dark but are very hard to notice. The camera has functioned perfectly since day one. I'm not sure what the specs say but the camera has functioned without a problem down to -20F. The motors that move the camera and the electronics have functioned flawlessly. I have not used or tested the wireless portion of the camera and would suggest which ever camera you purchase to do whatever you can to use a network cable and power over Ethernet if need be.Camera Software:The software is probably the biggest downfall of the camera. When you login it gives you 4 different options to use (IE mode, push or VLC modes for Safari/Firefox/Crome and snap mode for cell phone). In some ways this is good as you can select what kind of view/software you would like to use and you're not using some software that kind of functions as it was designed for another browser. Although it works with all browsers it has a few more functions with IE and a slightly better outlay. The overall software could be given a little sharper look. The buttons have no names but are easy to figure out with 5 minutes of using the camera. As everyone has their own preferences it takes only a few minutes to go through all the available menus to set your preferences. One downfall is the OSD (On Screen Display) of the time and date. You can set this to any color which is fine but as the camera moves the background color changes making the OSD unreadable a lot of the time. They need to enable a black box to appear around the OSD so it's always viewable. The software has many options which really help you overcome any unique problems that come up like flipping the camera, DSL settings, screen rate, dial up, FTP, PR speeds and the list goes on. The camera responds very quickly with all commands. I have accessed the camera from home and away on my laptop, mobile phone and IPAD in the US and overseas and each time the camera worked perfectly. I have some 3rd part software on my IPHONE and IPAD that access all my cameras and the camera is supported by this software. I have never had to reset or reboot the camera to fix any issues. The good thing about any of the minor issues I mentioned, a software update can easily take care of any of these issue.Camera Image:The image is very clear and looks great whether viewing it on my IPHONE, IPAD or laptop. I had it set to full frame rate and can achieve that most times. The night vision works very well with great range on the IRs and no reflections back into the camera. I found the IRs can be just a little bright when the place is covered in snow but it's hardly noticeable.Overview:I would recommend this camera to anyone who would like to monitor outside a home or business. It could be also used in larger inside areas as well such as a garage. With very little network or computer knowledge most people should be able to set one of these cameras up. I would suggest using a static IP address where possible and you must forward ports on your router to make this viewable outside of your home or business.

Just ordered the new Panasonic WV-SW175 pan-tilt outdoor cam.  This puppy will do 720P (1280x960) and is rated IP55 outdoor.  I'll be doing a review on this cam in a couple of weeks.  Street price is in the $500-600 range.  I'm very comfortable with Panasonic cams - I have five of them.------------------------------------I *really* wanted to like this camera due to the attractive price and since I needed to replace a very old Toshiba PT outdoor IP cam that isn't working well, but after three weeks of evaluation, this cam is going back to Amazon :-(First off, this cam does not have audio capabilities in spite of the user interface with those available options which leads me to believe that not a penny (yen) more was spent on on software/firmware development than absolutely necessary to get this camera to market.  While talking about the user interface, the cam movement control buttons provide no visual feedback (as in a mouseover action) that the buttons are active and your mouse click actually was received by the cam.The user feature set needs to *much* more robust.  For one example there is no choice about an uploaded file name (the ability to overwrite an uploaded file.)  My Toshiba and Panasonic cams have options that let you upload a file with the same file name for overwrite.  I have a web page which gets a new image uploaded every one to two minutes and the image *must* have the same file name in order for it to be viewed.  Only having timestamping for a file name doesn't work in all situations.I found color balance to be pretty good in an indoor daylight situation, IR night vision worked fairly well, and auto exposure indoors was surprisingly good (but a little slow to respond to changing light conditions.)Colors were somewhat washed out outdoors in bright light but the primary issue is poor image quality, either outdoors or indoors.  Areas of the picture are noticeably out of focus, I'll upload a sample picture and you can decide for yourself.Another problem was the one-shot or save picture feature (take a still picture) worked one time.  Every time I tried to capture a new still image, I always got the first one I snapped.Emails to support were not promptly answered.Lastly, when will the makers of these cheap outdoor cams realize the dongle MUST GO!  I want a cam with PoE capability and no exposed dongles!Final thoughts:I have come to the conclusion that there is NO WAY you are going to buy a quality outdoor PT or PTZ cam for under $500.  If you find one, let me know.  In the meantime, I'm looking closely at the ACTi line of outdoor cams, particularly the KCM-7211 - it's an outdoor HiDef PTZ (optical zoom with auto focus) with PoE - street price seems to be around 700 bucks.EDIT:  Oops.. The KCM-7211 is NOT PTZ - the lens is fixed :-(", "Date": "September 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Agasio A622W", "Author": "GEDS", "ReviewID": "R1ANL4ZPRMFDLQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The images from the camera are great, even in darkness due to the IR filter.

I have not found a way to define a new home position on this camera, as can be done with many models of Panasonic PTZ cameras.  The other issue this camera has is that it will stop sending video.  This has happened twice now.  When this happens, you need to log into the camera to restart it or you must unplug it.  I have mine hooked up to a timer now.I use IP Cam Viewer on my smartphone to manage my cameras.  What I have found is that you can control most of the PTZ functions of this camera if you define it as a Foscam FI8904W.I haven't been able to find another wireless PTZ camera with IR in this price range.  For now I will live with a timer and hope that a firmware upgrade will address the issues I have.", "Date": "June 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poor quality and unreliable", "Author": "Scimanic", "ReviewID": "R3CULGYUNM5BNI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Although the I like the physical design of this camera (1 star for that), the firmware/software has a lot of issues.

(2nd level) to overview front yard, street and driveway.Main issues:- poor night vision (circular haze)- image quality (it is only a 640x480)- would sometimes just fail and needs to be powered off and on to reactivate- pan/tilt presets are off at times (your preset would not set the camera in the position you thought it would)Seeing how fast the IP camera world is moving today, I would not buy this camera again. There are better cameras available. 2-3 MP PTZs are still expensive though. But if you can live without PTZ, then look for IPC/Dahua or QSee cameras.Note on the provided video: This camera is a little older than one year at this point.

The video from the camera even fritzed out and glitched while I watched it, something I'd not seen any of my wireless cameras do before. Fortunately, I had a few spare 12v transformers lying around, so I switched the camera over to a more robust model. That stopped the fritzing out, but the IR lens filter will no longer cycle. It is permanently stuck in \"day\" mode, so that I can't see anything at night.After stating the above to the seller, I was told they would be happy to resolve my issue by issuing a replacement power supply. The camera is junk. Buy a camera without built in IR +a weatherproof IR LED array, and you will have a more useful setup, IMO.

After initial startup I could not get the unit to operate so I contacted TechSupport who had me up and running within 5 minutes of me dialing the tech support number.  I was able to configure the unit via the RJ45 port.  I will say, having some light networking knowledge will help you configure the unit a little faster.  After confirming the unit worked well using the RJ45 I went onto configure the wireless portion which worked great until I installed the unit at the permanent location.  I could no longer control the unit or see it on my network.  Instead of calling tech support I read other reviews to see if other's who purchased may have had similar problems.  The answer is yes.  Here is how I fixed my problem.  First I had to understand that the camera operates in wireless-G frequency, my router is an N.  Simple fix, I put the router in mixed G and N mode.  I then had to figure which channel of the wireless-G worked best for my camera.  After all of that it would work for a few hours and then stop again.  Finally, I figured I would put my software in garage pulse signal mode.  That configuration seems to have fixed the problem.  After installation, weather proofing the RJ45 connection and reset button was needed since the wires are not long enough to be routed in doors.  I am extremely pleased with the video, control, but mostly the sturdy manufacturing of the product.I only give this a 3 star because there is not much information in the manual on how to reset the unit or that it operates in wireless G mode.

The casing is very robust and it looks like it'll last some time, but they didn't design the power cord to be outside and in the elements, nor did they make this version Power Over Ethernet.  The power cord - simple brick with a thin wire isn't ready to be outside all the time, there's no direct 110V connection and I need a separate injector to push power to it via ethernet.It just leaves me feeling like they hit a long fly ball to deep center field that was subsequently caught on the warning track.

I'm literally stunned at the consumers here who offer a 4-Star rating for this camera.  It's 1-Star, at best.  First off, the picture clarity is abysmal.  I have this camera as part of a 6 camera group that I have monitoring my property.  The Agasio A622W is installed in front of my home so that I can log in and check on my property while I'm at work or away for any extended period of time.  The picture quality is pretty bad and the quality is even worse at night.  The glare from the street lights distorts the images and the only utilities offered to tweak this are the Bright and Contrast options in the web interface.  Speaking of web interface, this has to be the clunkiest interface that I've ever used.  First of all, it doesn't (the web interface) work well unless you weaken all of your security in Internet Explorer.  When you do this, Internet Explorer even warns you that your computer is at risk.  Great.  Firefox and Chrome work also, but you will NOT get all of the options that you would ordinarily get using Active X in Internet Explorer.  It gets better.  When this camera reboots, it's not smart enough to go the last position where it was, it goes back to the factory default position.  Terrible, just terrible.  Do Not believe the advertisement for this camera that says it has \"True Color\" Images, that is a 100% lie. When I look out from this camera my grass is gray, not green. I even called Agasio (Foscam) and had them remotely log into my computer and try to adjust the settings, no luck.  Also, the DDNS for this camera is not free, so you will have to pay for a DDNS host if your home environment does not have a static IP address.  The only thing good about this camera is that it's  nice looking, but when it comes to performance, save your money.  Folks, take it from a guy who has 6 cameras, you will NOT be happy with the A622W.  When a product is goo, I'm more than happy to praise it.

I've had to reset it multiple times as it disconnects from my wireless network all the time.And no, problem is not the wireless setup as the setup has been done as per their recommendation, my access point's firmware is updated, the signal is great, no interference...The night vision is great, if the camera is setup indoors, but when setup outdoors (which is what I bought the camera for), the night vision is worthless.

However, making the software run with active x control is a major hassle under Windows 7. Without changing the security settings the sofware will NOT install. It took me about 2 hours to figure out and test the settings to make it work.Both the ethernet connection and the wireless work well and allow a good control of the camera movements up to 100 feet from the router. It is also some hassle to configure the router for the camera. Since I use a reliable business router (MOTOROLA) it takes some time to make it work with the camera. The settings have to be made manually with the ethernet cable connected to the camera. Once it is set up and the router recognizes the camera, the wireless will also work.In cases of placing the camera away from a power source (house), it is recommendable to install a 2 pair power cable for 12 volts, not to exceed 150 feet. This power cable must be equipped with a jack on one end to plug into the power adapter and a plug to go into the camera. The jack and plug are available on E-Bay but ususally come in bundles of 10, when you need only one of each. Jack and plug should come with the camera.Using a small solar panel for the power supply and a night battery is a feasible option to install the camera as a stand alone equipment and make it accesible under an ftp site.Also missing is a camera mount to a flat surface or a pole. I made a flat mount of polycarbonate myself, works well and perfectly fits to a standard DOT street sign pole of 10 feet height.Once the camera is off the floor, there is no way to reach the reset button unless climbing up a ladder. This is a feature that requires improvement such as a remote reset command as used in communication equipment.Conclusion:1. Good camera with high value for the dollar2. The connections need some attention (to the computer and the router)3. The software installation instructions need improvement4. The power jack and plug should be added to the supply5. The operation / installation manual is outdated and does not truly reflect the actual camera but somehow still serves the purpose.Once you have one camera set-up which will not exceed a total cost of $400.00 you can create your own alarm and surveillance system with up to 8 cameras for yourself. Such can also be combined with emergency calling (911) with a pre-recorded message. In any case your company and / or house can be supervised by yourself remotely.

I've been running it for 2 weeks and although its had some issues, I've been happy with it.First, I learned that this camera falls into a category of cameras that is often called \"Foscam Clones\" or \"Chinese IP Cameras\".  It turns out this is a good thing because it means the camera will work with almost any desktop or smartphone app that works with Foscam cameras.  If your interested in programming your own apps, you can search for \"IPCAM CGI SDK\" for docs on remote interaction with the camera or \"Open IP Cam\" for people that work on free replacement firmware.All the cameras in this class are not the simplest things to set up.  You need to be pretty comfortable with setting up IP devices.  If your not comfortable with that, you might look for a device that claims ease of use as its main feature.Agasio's web page has a help forum and documentation online if you run in to issues.  If they are unable to resolve your issues there, I suggest then moving to Foscam's help forums since they hardware is somehow related.  In fact, it was on their web site I found the solution to the main issue I have with this camera.The video feed will sometimes \"strobe\" from dark to light and this causes false motion detection.  Foscam forums mentioned this is somehow related to data overload.  If your wifi signal is weak and your pushing highest video resolution and frame rate, it can cause this as the data backs up.  Either use an Ethernet cable or lower resolution to resolve this issue.  If it ever gets into this mode, you will be forced to manually reset it (using web interface) to correct it.If you look at cameras in this price range and feature set, they are mostly clones of each other (probably have exact same internal parts) with main difference being either supporting zoom or night vision; but not both.  I prefer the night vision of this camera.  X10 recently announced a $100 more camera that supports both but the verdict is still out on them and their customer service is iffy.The other thing that is different among cameras in this class is the external housing and its quality.  Most look cheap and plasticy. This camera is all metal with nice lines and glass.  The product picture looks like it would be bright white but I was happy to find its an off white which fits in better in most outside colors.I recommend this camera overall but you will have to deal with manually monitoring it and rebooting it.

Second one is mounted in shade of a satellite dish temps still get to 100+ but no direct sunlight - works well with the shade helping avoid washing out landscape.Items to note - glass dome needs to be kept clean , desert dust affects it at night and rain drop stains will affect night vision - does NOT affect the daytime views.Set up - well patience helps , once you master the learning curve not too difficult.

I can confirm some other reviewer's comments.  The camera box was labeled PTZ but it's not PTZ it's PT only.  It was not misrepresented on Amazon so I got what I expected.  There is a slight halo when it is on infra red (no big deal).  The documentation is not very helpful.  After having installed the M1051, I was expecting this one to be a breeze but it took me for a bit of a ride.  The installation was rather different.  This one does not appear on the router list of devices and I did have to open a port for it.  The M1051 did not need a port opened and was present in the router list.  I initially thought the unit was defective so called tech support.  They got back to me the next day.  By that time, I had got it working but still had some issues with some of the controls not being functional in the browser interface.  Sandra, at tech support, was very helpful in addressing my concerns and screen shared in my PC to get these issues resolved.  Now the interface is fully functional and I can even see my M1051 in the same window.  Not having any experience with other IP cameras, I cannot compare this to others but I am happy with both of these cameras.  They do all they claim.  I even set them up at times to snap photos on motion detect.  The camera emails me with a few samples while uploading a bunch more to a remote FTP site I have. Works very well.  In fact, you could put up a sign that reads \"if you are reading this, it's too late.  Your picture has already been uploaded to a remote server.

When you get it, make sure you do the setup first then leave it close by where you can test it for a couple of days before you install it. The instructions for port forwarding, etc were pretty straight forward, so I was up and running in no time, able to view and move the camera over my iphone. Night vision was also decent, I have a back yard of about 5,000 sq ft, this shows most of it at night with far corners being barely visible, but I'll take it.The rotation is not full 360 deg like it says. It has a stop-turn, so it's 359 degrees. Usually not a problem, unless you have to install the camera backwards, then it's a major annoyance.  I installed mine on roof studs from inside between wall and roof and the antenna got in the way (not bended as is shown in the picture), so I drilled a new hole and brought it out from the side.Overall, I'm pretty happy with the quality of the camera itself, but the resolution could be better. One issue I have is with shadows - when one part is sunny and one part is shady, it shows the shady parts as pitch black, until you move the camera toward the shady part then the contrast adjusts. The difference between light and dark is a bit too extreme. Less of an issue, but still a minor irritant - the wide angle view or the lack of it.Lack of zoom is another issue, but in my case I am happy this doesn't have zoom and audio because it's installed in my back yard and if someone gains control of the camera over the internet I don't want them to look inside my house.

Despite the less than favorable reviews I decided that this camera at least looks like the best one. None of the IP cameras that are P/T are rated very well which I am guessing the reason for that is they are all made fairly cheaply. I was impressed with the camera once I got it. It is an all aluminum housing. The dome is plastic. I wanted night vision capabilities however I am not too picky on how much detail I get. A lot of people seem to complain about the \"Halo\" at night when the IRs are on. No one has uploaded a photo so I could only assume how bad it would be. Much to my surprise, it wasn't toooooo bad. I have attached a photo. If the dome were constructed of glass I would imagine that this really wouldn't be an issue however that may bring on a whole other set of issues. I had a tough time getting it hooked up. I called tech support and they had it up and running in a few minutes. Excellent support there. My HUGE issue is the reliability of the WX connection. The camera has to be hooked up to the ethernet cable to set it up and the WX up. So after tech support got it working, I went and installed it up on a pole. It worked for a few minutes then went kaput. It had power, I saw the LEDs on but it would not work. So up I went to retrieve the camera only to have to hook it back up to the ethernet cable and load the backup settings file I had saved before I unplugged it. It began working again so I put it back up on the pole and so far its working perfect but my trust is pretty low. I hope it was an isolated glitch because hooking it up to the ethernet cable is not an option for me. Overall, excellent camera, the daytime video is pretty good and night time isn't horrible.

And there is currently NO software control to turn off the IR LEDs. only option would be to opening the dome and doing a field mod inserting a power switch to the LEDS which would void the warranty. Are you listening (again) Agasio? This is the second review on Amazon, stating the IR LED dome reflections on this product are a significant problem? Note that there are no reflections or distortion issues during daytime use.Summary: If outdoor daytime use is your primary application, don't hesitate to get this very well constructed camera.

The cable is a little difficult to work with as it will not fit through a 1\" hole when installing. Had to drill 1.25\". The exterior is metal, feeling much more solid than most of the other units I have tried. This is the only dome cam I have purchased where the entire dome rotates instead of the cam rotating inside a dome. There is some halo effect from IR since they are inside the dome but it really isn't too bad. Color is nice, range of motion is nice.

The camera feed is crisp & clear. Night vision is also clear with no \"halo\" as with other infra red night vision cameras. The PTZ functions perfectly, (drive motors are a little louder than expected), and oddly, the entire dome rotates, not just the internal camera. In spite of that odd quirk, it's still an excellent camera! The wireless connection appears to works flawlessly, once connected.CON:Less than stellar software. Very limited! You 1st need to connect and set up with the Ethernet cable before you can use the wireless function. (This is typical). Good luck finding your IP address. Having to use the web browser to set up the camera properties is awkward at best. A security camera novice or 1st time home owner would get very frustrated very quickly, so try to remain patient. The software is supplied via a mini CD, making it impossible to use on a Mac Mini running Windows or a side load CD/DVD tray.Requiring access to a power supply within 3 feet of the camera placement could require the services of a qualified electrician. Additionally, you will need a weather proof electrical box within one foot to enclose the power connection. All this could get pretty costly, if you're not the \"do-it-yourself\" type.This camera IS NOT PoE!(Power over Ethernet). Meaning you HAVE to use the power supply plug. If you have a power failure, you lose your camera feed.RECOMMENDATIONS:BUY THIS CAMERA! But, don't bother with the supplied limited software. I use iSpy (free, Windows only, no mac) camera software. It's the perfect compliment to the AWESOME camera! Download and install iSpy 1st, 2nd connect the camera, then follow the instructions for setting up your camera.

Always on and working via the laptop or my Android phone. When I first installed the camera I used it both hard wired and wireless. I had no problems operating it wireless mode except a second or two of lag time while panning around. In the end It was easy for me to just wire the camera into the network for best operation. The wireless and wired software and network installations were no problem as the manual was very clear on how to install and configure the camera. I had the camera up and  test running in 10 minutes. The browser interface that comes with works best in Explorer (I'm using 9) all the features work. Chrome and Firefox (My Fav) a few of the camera controls are missing or not working and that to bad because IE and I don't get along well. The camera works with many different types of IP Cam Viewers on the Net for download and most are Free if you hunt around. The ones listed on Agasio's site work well  Try them all and pick the one you like. I also tried several different Android viewer apps before I decided on one that worked best for me. Connecting and using DNS was problem free as well. I used dyn dns as my provider. I had never used DNS before. The set up was fairly smooth, the cam manual instructions made all the difference. Note: After  the Camera, router and DNS was set up the camera didn't work right away or worked on and off. After reading The help section on the DNS site it can take up to 72 hours for The IP addresses to work properly in the net.In my opinion the camera is well made, all metal and the clear globe appears to be glass so it's stayed clean on it's own. I have the camera installed out in the open with no protection, so far the camera hasn't leaked or shown any signs of weather damage. I'm in the south and we have had many heavy storms this last winter and spring.Daylight picture quality is good and in focus I able to clearly see anything on my property that the camera is able to pan to. Images and video that the camera takes in daylight hours are acceptable to good quality. I have all settings set to High Quality. Night viewing is fair to poor at best. There is a halo affect while viewing from the night vision lights that reflects back at the camera lens making for poor viewing. You have the ability to turn off the night vision lights and if your lucky like me I have a street light that provides enough light to view my property good enough. I also have a 4 cam system with a DVR. It's a middle of the road system and gets the job done. This Agasio IP Dome cam has much better picture quality and better color than the more expensive DVR cams I have. I would give this camera 5 stars if it wasn't for the halo reflection making for poor viewing quality at night which I believe is a very important time when one would want the best quality viewing and recording should the need arise. I just ordered Agasio's model with the smoked globe and zoom feature for a large area of my property that is out of view. I'm hoping that not having night vision lights and the smoked globe will work better for me at night with the building lights that are on all night in this area. I think these cameras are a good value for what they do,  my trouble free usage for 5 mounts now for under $200.

It's a chore, and ridiculous to try to read.  The garbage documentation doesn't stop in the printed realm.  I own a mac, and it was kind of funny to see the \"mac documentation\" for this device on the enclosed CD.  The documentation consisted of a plain text file, with 4 lines of content.  Poorly thought out, and poorly made documentation.2. micro-CD with drivers (good luck using the disc w/ a slot loaded dvd drive).3. Garbage software. Comes with browser-based software.  Does what you need it to do, but the creators obviously failed their classes in interface design, or didn't know any better.  Oh well.4. Haloing of infrared light at night around lens.5. Minor learning curve.  To use this, you should have BASIC knowledge of how IP addresses and ports are used.  It's not rocket science, but not something I would be confident having my grandmother, or even parents set up.6. No N connectivity, only G.  boooo.----------Pros:1. Good build quality.

VERY CLEAR in total darkness! Our installs light up a big parking lot.PTZ is good, Zoom is digital, but ok. Pan and tilt has a very good range of motion.Conclusion:Mount them high up, use the default aim point for your aim point if possible.Remember, this ain't PoE and you will need to provide AC to the mounting area. So that can change your cost profile unless AC is already in place.Worth using for the right people, over a very good camera. Personally some solid firmware revisions would make all the difference.We are using Ispy Connect for DVR software, these cameras work well.

I have installed several cameras previously so if you are familiar with it, that makes it easy.  I get great pictures at night.

The only issue I have is that I would have preferred to mount the camera on the ceiling, but the mounting bracket that comes with the camera is only to mount on the wall.  It's still fine.  It has pretty good range to pick up the wireless because the camera is quite a distance from the Access Point.

I love both models.  I use the IPCam FC app on my Apple products which works good for me.  If I could change anything about the A622W it would be 2 things...1 - Allow custom scans.  When you turn on the scan/pan/patrol option, you get a lot of areas I do not want scanned (e.g. great up-close pictures of my house's siding, etc).  If you could program a custom area to scan, that would be great! ...hint, hint2 - Come up with a different transformer.  The one included is a standard wall wart.  Meaning you have a black box with AC prongs sticking out of it.  You either have to drill a hole in your wall (not an option for me since I just built my house) and plug it in a wall socket or you have to plug it in to an outside socket (not too secure from the bad guys).  I intend on installing weatherproof single gang boxes near my outside sockets to better secure the wall warts. However, I am concerned about heat in the summer.  I could install a landscape light power supply but they are big and bulky and also are easy to unhook.The images are great during the day.  There is a little haloing at night, but not terrible.  I wish I had more lighting in my cul de sac to see a longer distances, but the lighting I have on my house allows me good visibility of my driveway, front yard, and front door and windows.
