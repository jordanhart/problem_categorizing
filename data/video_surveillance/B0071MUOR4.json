Hook up was easy,so far after about a month is woking excellent for my needs.  You can buy a Hi-res camera for the Chanel you really need to see detail on but the supplied cameras work great. Complete kit.would be 5 stars although manual not well written,how ever when i contacted them for tech support, they responded quickly and answred lots of my questions.
