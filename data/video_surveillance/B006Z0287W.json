And it my case, where night vision is of importance to me, this model of camera has definitely exceeded my expectation...I run 13 of these camera into a DVR by the same company, Q-SEE. With there HD video output, daylight camera views are very clear and crisp.Night time images, when the distant gets out to the outer areas of the cameras range are hard to make out. But in my case, I need about 30 feet of night vision and these do the job.Also, as mentioned in a comment... The Customer Service is on the money... There are not a 100%, I will say. But they are close to it...Highly recommend...", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "ALREADY CAUGHT A THIEF", "Author": "gay reynolds", "ReviewID": "R268XLE3U9IOFS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "AWESOME ITEM IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED AND WORKS REALLY WELL.

They all worked correctly for a few days. But then the infrared LEDs on 4 of the 6 cameras started coming on intermittently with all of the lights turned on in the room, and turned their video to black and white. And a few cameras infrared LEDs always stayed on, so its video never turned to color, even with bright room lighting. The Electrician double checked the video cables, connectors and power input at each camera. And he said everything was what Q-SEE recommended. So I called Q-SEE and told them about this. They said the four cameras with problems may be defective. So they sent me 4 replacement cameras under warranty. But most of the replacement cameras have the same problem. So I am very unhappy!! And I want a full refund!!!", "Date": "April 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "I dont like it", "Author": "JORGE", "ReviewID": "R10VX50IE2OB2U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "camera works ok for two weeks an then image is white and black ,very poor quality ,I am trying to return the item,waiting for seller respond.", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "CCTV 480TV Line", "Author": "Julian", "ReviewID": "R26F5H1MM7B0JH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am not impress with this camI bought a cam that cost $20 {Zmodo CM-C22623BG ] that does a better job in the day light.the night vision is good but again the range is that great as marketed.", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "below my expectation!", "Author": "Techman \"destinpc\"", "ReviewID": "R3AEQXDRP88YAP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The one i Received might be different as the picture compare to my 420 tvl by another company  is not much of a different.

I currently have the very basic, cheap Zmodo PKD-DK40107 4Channel DVR 480TVL--which isn't too bad, but I just needed something with more night vision power. It was nice because I already BNC cables routed, so it was a simple swap with the old camera, screw in the new base plate and done. Very nice picture day and night. I've posted before and after pictures of the night image for you to see in the photo area. The camera itself feels very sturdy and well made as well.", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not bad for an analogue outdoor cam", "Author": "The mother of all prduct reviews", "ReviewID": "R3I3YEKY0JQ4G7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I question the 600TVL on this. When I ordered this, I was actually sent the next model up at no extra charge, which was touted as 700TVL. My system only recognizes it as 540TVL.However, during the daytime, the image looks great. At night, it deteriorates. I would say the IR LED's reach out about 80 feet, not 120... although the night mode still picks up ambient light from further distances, but not enhanced by IR.Overall, I am satisfied with it. It has held up to cold/wind/rain/snow so far and I haven't had to touch it once since initial installation, so I can't complain for the price. The wider field of view was an unexpected touch that favored my application.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Q-See QM6006B delivered as advertised", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "R3EP57KUP8JRXF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this as an addition to my current cameras.
