I admire they provide \"IP camera setup process for dummies\". If you have a smartphone and install their app(the app is free), the setup is pretty easy and you just go step by step then you can complete the setup process in 5 mins. As a long time IP camera user, I know how complicated it can be when setting up the IP camera. Therefore if you are searching for a remote viewing IP camera, this is for you.[Remote viewing] - pros and consThey offer remote viewing on website, iOS app (I don't have Andriod device so I have no idea about if they have andriod apps). The setup for remote viewing is also very easy. However you have to be aware -- the app they recommend with the package is an extremely bad quality app. I have to connect to camera 3-4 times in order to have successful connection. and when I connect to camera successfully, the app will quit suddenly with no reason. I rescue myself from this situation  by finding out they actually has another app called \"isecurity+\". this app is far more stable than the other one.[Video quality is average] - just a fact you need to knowThe video quality is not good. some people think it's bad quality. It is true that the video quality is not good. Especially when you planning to install this camera from a high point and plan to watch the whole room. You of course will still know who is coming, but you will not be able to see the details. I guess it's just because of their product positioning - with this cheap price, they probably use the lower quality of camera. For the quality issue, it depends on everyone;s need.  I use this camera in \"I just want to know if there is anyone passing through\" area. so I am ok with the quality.[Unstable quality] - CONS! need to think carefully before you buy.This is the main reason I give this product 3 stars. I am pretty happy with this camera during initial weeks. However, I found it will disconnect itself and not be able to go back to reconnect it automatically. You have to reconnect the power cord to let it reconnect to camera again. after few weeks I discover a more worse situation - sometimes no matter how many times I reconnect the power cord it still cannot connect back to the internet. and the only way to make it normal again is to go through the initial IP setup wizard to have it reconnect to wifi hotspot...etc.Let's say you are away from your camera physically. When your camera is in this bad tempter you have nothing to do with it. The only way you can do is ask your friend / family to reonnect the power cord for you. However if this camera runs into situation that you need to rerun the setup wizard. Boom! you are dead. unless you lucky enough has a friend/family who can use an iOS device to run the setup process again and you are willing to let him know your ID and password.[Other nice features]They have night vision function. They have monthly subscription package (monthly fee required) to send you motion detection and online recording. these are good feature.However the bad stability for the product is a big draw back for me.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Value, Easy Setup", "Author": "QualityViews", "ReviewID": "R3DS7STVM7OP44", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a little uncertain about this camera before I received it. I was very pleased with the ease of setup. I configured it all through my iphone and the instructions were clear and easy to follow. I was confused because initially it was in night mode so I thought it was just a black and white camera but after a few minutes it adjusted into color mode and everything was great.Works great as a security camera. Shortly after installing my wife and I were out to dinner and I received a call from my wife's phone which she had left home. I quickly pulled out my iphone and connected to the camera to see if we had an intruder. We could see there was nobody in the front room of the house and her phone was right there on the table. We never solved that mystery but at least we could tell that nobody was in the house.My wife likes that she can login and see her puppy when she is at work.It would be nice if it had remote pan and zoom but for the price it is a great value. It also works quite well in low light situations.

Normally I don't write reviews but feel compelled to do so with this webcam to save someone from wasting money on it.First the pros:It really is very easy to set up and has never spontaneously disconnected/needed reconnecting. I even unplugged it and moved it to another nearby outlet and it didn't need to be reset. It will need to be reset if you unplug it for longer periods of time (or likely after a power failure).The camera unit is of decent quality and the 3 LEDs on it make it easy to read the status and diagnose issues.You can log in remotely and view the camera image. I have DSL and an older iPhone and it does work.Now for the bad news:When logging in, over and over, I get an error code saying that my phone can't connect to the camera - check the network settings (or something to that effect). So after about 10 times of retrying (it really gets annoying), suddenly it will magically log me in. And no, there was nothing wrong with the network settings so obviously this is a generic code that is not helpful.Once you are logged in, you'll discover that the camera image quality is really very poor (even on the higher settings). You will see color by day and it does do a fair job of using IR (?) to see black and white at night, but the image is out of focus at every range. In fact, the image is so poor that if the camera is about 10 feet from the dogs, I cannot see the blonde colored dog against a light blue blanket at all. And at farther ranges, you can't make out smaller background details at all.The bottom line is, if you just want something easy to set up and will be happy with a relatively poor quality image - perhaps just to see that no one is breaking into your back door or to see a few blobs that might be your small dogs/cats/etc., then this set up is okay. But if you had hoped for something of higher quality and don't like logging in over and over while the unit has pretend network setting issues, then try one of the other webcam set ups. You'll be a lot happier in the long run. I may return this unit if Amazon will take it back (another reviewer seemed to suggest that this is non-returnable which would be a shame).", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pleasantly Surprised", "Author": "Jan Jan", "ReviewID": "R17D66SC00IPDJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera because some personal effects of mine were stolen; and I was hoping to catch the culprit if they came back.  So far nothing, but I have to say that this little device is great!As with the other reviewers, it was simple to set up and quite easy to navigate.  Word of caution, when I used it for only 2 hours, it used up nearly 1/2G.  That's a lot.  However, for the peace of mind, it is worth it.I took advantage of the 30 day free trial for iSecurity+ that allows you to receive email notifications when someone enters the \"designated area\" as well as stores video in their cloud system.  While I am receiving FAR too many emails for every little bit of movement, having the ability to see what's going on around my area has been great.  I can pretty much weed out which snapshots I don't need.The picture quality is about a 6 out of 10.  It can be grainy; but so long as the camera is in a good range, you can definitely make out who the individuals are.  I will likely subscribe to the iSecurity+ service once the trial expires.Note:  The stored images can take some time to load.  I have had as many as 600 frames for a particular time period.  I try to delete that particular set of pictures, but sometimes it won't right away and you have to keep at it until it deletes.  But that has nothing to do with the camera itself.  Still if the picture quality was HD, it was be five stars.  Still no complaints and I certainly recommend.

That's rarely a good experience.This product is idiot-proof, takes little time to set up and requires virtually no time to add other cameras.If you have multiple cameras you won't be able to view multiple locations simultaneously, as you can with some cameras, such as Panasonic's BL-C131A, so if constant multiple-site monitoring of a location is what you need, this is not ideal.For example, if you have three cameras on three levels of  your house, you much view each individually.

The way the camera works is by connecting to your wi-fi, and the camera is monitored via their iSecurity+ app. I have no complaints about the camera. I was able to set it up in just a few minutes with no issues. It was fairly self-explanatory. The picture is nice and full color. It has a night mode which also works well and allows us to see our baby without going into his room and disturbing him. I was able to mount it to the wall pretty easily and get a good viewing angle.Now, the app (which I think you NEED to use the camera) is pretty irritating at times:1) The camera stream times out after 5 minutes, even when I'm on Wi-Fi. I wish it would let me run the camera as long as I wish to, or set up different rules for 4g/wifi so that I can customize how long the camera streams before timing out.2) After a camera time out, I cannot reload the camera. I have to close out the app, log back in, and reload it (which takes a lot of extra time).3) A camera can only be synced with one account. For my husband to have access to viewing the camera I had to set him up as a \"friend\" and give him viewing permissions. It'd be nice if a camera could be linked to several people in the same household, though I can see that this could pose security risks so I can live with this one. At least we have the option to allow him to view via a friend account.Overall, I would say this camera was worth the money because it was really affordable and it meets our needs.

The sound is very sensitive which works well with our newborn being I'm his room and my being someone who wears hearing aids. We plan on using this to watch him during naps if we're say working in the yard or perhaps eventually spying on a babysitter though that would work better if it could pan and zoom.

What helped to catch the jerks was a photo they took of themselves on my ipad that uploaded to my iphone. It was the only thing that lead the police to them and otherwise, a portion of my things would not have been recovered. I was hesitant to put a security camera in my home as I already felt I was locking the place down but I see the overall value of photographic evidence. Should someone come in, sharing the video and stills with law enforcement would be a breeze.I bought another camera that was not Mac friendly and returned it the next day. This little guy was easy to set up and works fine. I'm even considering adding another.So, here is my downside: I wish it were a different color as I haven't found the best spot for it (the cops told me not to mount it high since people keep their heads down). I'd even suggest scaling the side down so you can tuck it in a corner or something. The only other downside is the color. Unless you have white white walls, it's hard to hide (I fit mine in a planter, isn't a long term solution, but i ts good for now.) Sometimes the video is choppy or unclear AND worst yet, I am more aware of bad outfit choices! I've been keeping my hallway light on, it gives a more consistent and clear photo.Oh, there is a monthly fee for the photos to upload to their cloud. I think the fee is 5.99/month, something I'd gladly pay though that information is somewhat hard to find.

The camera itself is a great little camera design with smart design and swivel neck to adjust it to just the right angle and can be set on a flat surface and or mounted solid on wall, ceiling, cabinet, shelve etc.  - The camera optics are not of high quality...There is more design R&D; with investment to the software and casing then there is to the actual image quality.  - It has IR LEDS in a standard ring around the lens that can be set to Auto light dimming detection for auto IR illumination.  - The image quality streams at an acceptable level.  - The quality is ok at a bold view scenario when sharp detail is not necessary.* Personal Usage Story- \"a few weeks back Tropical Storm Debby formed in the golf and started to swell the Rivers and all water basins...

The you've found the right product (one of many I'm sure).I use this to keep an eye on my 2 year old but also have a \"baby monitor\" which has sound only.I give this 5 stars for simplicity of setting this up. Here's all you need:1. Wireless router to connect to.2. Power outlet near camera location.3. SmartphoneSetup is easy assuming you follow directions. You will need to download a free app to access the video. Once it's setup, it's as easy as opening an app to view your live video feed.So here's the pros and cons:PROS:1.Easy setup - you DO NOT need to be technical to make this work. This, to me, is the main selling point here.2.App is free - upgrades are available for $$$ (ie. recording, notifications, etc.)3.Video loads fast when connected to the host internet (ie. when you are in your house)4.Daylight video quality is pretty good.5.Great for a nanny cam setup. (Not for babies, more like 1-2 year olds, more on this below)CONS:1.Video is slow to load when not connected to your host internet. It doesn't matter if your are connected to a super fast wifi connection - if it's not the same connection as the camera is connected to, it's slow to connect. It's even slower (even hit or miss) to connect if you are on to LTE/3G. In addition, the live feed will time out after a couple minutes.2. Sound quality is HORRENDOUS. I rate it a 0 out of 5. Sound rarely connects when not on a fast internet connection - this is where is falls short as a newborn nanny cam. I never turn on the sound - it's useless.3. Suspect quality - the power connection to the camera is flakey and if I move the camera, the unit goes out- luckily, I rarely move the camera.4. Night vision video quality is poor. This falls short here as a nanny cam as well. You would need the camera positioned directly above the child for this to be a good newborn nanny cam...but again, sound quality is poor so I do not recommend this as a nanny cam.So even with some of the cons above, I still rate this a 4/5.

I've used my iphone and my husbands android and the both run the app perfectly. the app you need to install is written in the instruction manual and it has a step by step on how to install it. works wirelessly with the wifi in your home. you can access the video feed from anywhere as long as you have the log-in and app. you can add friends in the app that i assume you can share your video feed with if you want. and you can access the video from a computer as well. very good quality camera! I found this to be better than any of the actual 'baby cam's that i looked at.", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for keeping an eye on my house and dog!", "Author": "rachelmarye", "ReviewID": "R1AKNGIF7TCH2C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great little camera that  works with my wireless network at home and can be viewed with my smart phone.I have been using the +Cam now for a while and I have really been happy with it.  In the past I would set up my webcam on my laptop with the seedonk program, before I left the house so I could check on my house and my dog if I wanted.  I think the best part about this little camera is that I don't have to do that anymore. It's always setup and ready to go. The initial set up was so easy, it took less than 5 minutes.I love the \"night vision\" too!  I used to have to leave a light on at night to be able to see on my webcam, but with the +Cam I don't have to do that anymore.  I can still see the room pretty well even when it's dark.There are a few flaws:The camera needs to be unplugged and plugged back in if your wireless internet cuts out, or if you reset your router.  It won't reconnect to the internet if you don't.The image that you see on your smartphone is more like several pictures in succession, its not really a \"video\" camera.The image quality is nothing special.Sometimes it will freeze on just one image for a long time.  For example, if my dog gets up and walks across the room, I might see an image of her on the camera standing in the middle of the room, and then a minute later I see another image of her laying down on the other side of the room.The camera is not defaulted for private viewing.  You have to manually go in and change the setting from public to private.Although there are a few minor flaws, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone on a budget and who wants to keep an eye on their house or pets while they are away.  It works well for that purpose, but if you are looking for a high definition security camera, this is not for you.Edit: About the privacy of the camera, the camera is defaulted to share with others, but if you haven't shared with anyone than it's basically private.  The private setting is just to stop sharing.  So the camera is never actually public, unless you choose it to be.", "Date": "July 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointing", "Author": "Kris Tanner", "ReviewID": "R2D4MCMPPT1Y78", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Looks good on paper but it just doesn't work.

I wanted the IR capability.  The Philipps M100d InMotion wifi cams are Super Easy to install and the iPhone app was so cool that I thought all wifi cam technology had turned the corner so I bought this one for its IR capability that the Philipps doesn't have.
