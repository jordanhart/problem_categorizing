You just plug it in, scan the tag on the camera with your phone, and type in your wi-fi password. Now I can watch what my dogs get up to when I am at work.  The only limitation is that camera needs to be plugged in and the ethernet cord provided is not that long.  So you might need some longer cords to get the camera in the best position.  That said the fact that you can pan and tilt the camera from your phone is great!  If you want a camera that allows you to snoop from time to time and take short videos or pictures, without wanting to obsessively record everything, this one is a great deal.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$199.99", "Features": "1/4\" CMOS sensor, built-in f6.0mm Lens and built-in IR-Cut filter\nWatch your home, baby or business anywhere, record on phone or PC\nNo hidden cost, doesn't need registration or create an account for monthly fee\nEasy setup, secure peer to peer connection.
