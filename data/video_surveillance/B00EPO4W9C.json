{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Mighty Mule Security Camera", "Author": "Levi", "ReviewID": "REATITONRQSDI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The entire system was extremely easy to setup and use for someone who has never done anything like this before. The cameras have a great picture during the day, and at night.  I like it because not only does it work as a security camera, but I can also check on my family playing in the backyard when I'm at work.Overall, I'm very happy with this security system, and I'd highly recommend this to a friend. Just make sure you know which side of the cable goes to the camera and the DVR before you run the cables, because if you run it backwards, you'll have to redo it.", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EPO4W9C"}}
