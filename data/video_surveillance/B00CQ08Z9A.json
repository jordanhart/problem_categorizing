issues, and has had the 5.51 firmware installed for a couple of weeks.  A second NC-326PW camera, located within 20 feet, has also had the 5.51 firmware installed for a couple of weeks.  The night vision on that second camera started failing a month or two ago.  It appears that the camera's light sensor unit failed, resulting in either the camera attempting to record in color at night with the infra-red lights turned off, or the camera repeatedly switching in and out of night mode (infra-red lights flash on and off) every other second.  Covering the light sensor does not cause the infra-red lights to turn on.  The camera's setup pages may be used to switch the infra-red lights on permanently, of course that configuration is not ideal since the camera behaves as if it were in bright sunlight at night, and intentionally darkens the camera's image.  It is for this reason that I am lowering my rating from five stars to four, and will lower the rating again if one of the other NC-326PW cameras develops the same problem.  I fully expect that TriVision support will either ship replacement parts to me or a replacement camera.The other two NC-326PW cameras currently have firmware version 5.43 (build 20130620) installed.  These two cameras will not accept firmware updates.  I have tried to install firmware versions 5.51 and 5.56B on the cameras using wireless connections, a long network cable connected to a network switch, and a six foot long crossover cable directly connected to a computer.  The firmware upgrade results in one of three behaviors: a web page displays a message indicating that the camera is out of memory, and that the firmware update should be attempted again after rebooting the camera; a message indicating that the web page could not be displayed; no change - Internet Explorer displays the hourglass indicating that it is waiting for a web page to load.  It is sometimes necessary to unplug the camera for two and an half minutes to recover from a failed firmware update.  I have attempted the upgrades from two computers, including the computer that successfully updated the other two NC-326PW cameras, without success since receiving the 5.51 update at the end of September.  I just attempted the 5.56B firmware update on these two cameras using the Google Chrome web browser, with the cameras connected to a network switch via a long network cable - the cameras accepted the firmware update from Google Chrome.  One of these two NC-326PW cameras also has had difficulty recovering from power outages, usually requiring me to unplug the camera from the power for roughly two and a half minutes.  I am hoping that the 5.56B firmware addresses that problem.Original Review:Description of the Attached Video:The video shows several video clips that were triggered by the cameras' motion capture capabilities (most of the specified motion pre-record video segment was trimmed); a variety of day and nighttime clips are included so that image quality and sound capture capabilities may be judged appropriately.  The video clips were imported into the Windows Live Movie Maker application where subtitles were added, and the video was output as a 1280x720 resolution WMV video file (24 frames per second, with a 4400kbps target - roughly the same as the original recording) with minimal video or sound quality loss.  The timestamp at the top-left of the video was added automatically by the cameras during recording.Over the last 15 months I purchased close to 30 smart IP security video cameras for use in both industrial and residential environments.  At the time of the initial TriVision purchase, I had never heard of TriVision cameras - looking at the specifications and pictures, the cameras appeared to be cheap Chinese knockoffs of Sharx and Y-Cam cameras.  Additionally, TriVision did not even have a website advertising/describing their products.  I bought one of the TriVision NC-107W indoor cameras, and was impressed by the high quality performance, the well written manual, the cost, and the functionality offered by the camera.Over the next several months I bought several more of the TriVision NC-107W indoor, TriVision NC-107WF indoor, and TriVision NC-306W outdoor cameras.  All of those cameras continue to work today, forgiving the occasional lockup.  In the middle of September 2012, the TriVision cameras picked up their first security incident in the residential environment.  A scrap picker driving a Kawasaki Mule (4x4 golf cart) drove up to the house, spent 10 seconds looking in a basement window, started walking behind the house, then suddenly jumped back into the still running Mule and left the property.  The bright white TriVision outdoor cameras that picked up the incident are clearly visible from the road - the sight of security cameras is not necessarily a deterrent for criminals.  Copies of the videos were provided to the local police, who were able to track down the Mule riding scrap picker once they obtained generated still photos from the video clips (the scrapper claimed that he never left the Mule - the video on the officer's iPhone showed otherwise).While the TriVision outdoor cameras were reliable, their 640x480 resolution is a serious limiting factor when trying to identify license plates on vehicles.  TriVision at the time did not make a higher resolution camera, so a week after the incident I bought two Y-cam 1080p YCBLHD6 outdoor cameras at a cost of $671.50 each.  I tried three different firmware versions on the Y-cam cameras.  Motion detection would not work, most (roughly 90%) of the uploaded videos were corrupt and the successfully uploaded included no sound, the cameras would usually lock up or fall off the wireless connection after a couple of hours, the cameras would record non-stop after switching from daytime to night vision recording (or vise-versa), and the cameras would work with neither the Synology Surveillance Station nor the Multi-Live software that shipped with the older Y-cam cameras and the TriVision cameras.  The two Y-cam 1080P cameras have been sitting in a box since October 25, 2012 when Y-cam's support department told me to expect a firmware upgrade to be released in the next 24 to 48 hours that would fix the problems - Y-cam still has not released a new version of the camera firmware.I bought two TriVision NC-316W outdoor cameras, and had some of the same problems that I experienced with the Y-cam cameras.  TriVision's support department would not respond when I emailed from either a Yahoo or Google Gmail account, but I eventually received a response when using a third (non-free) email address.  The cameras required two or three firmware updates in the first month before the problems were resolved and the cameras became stable.  It was at this point that I knew for a fact that the TriVision cameras are not just cheap Chinese knockoffs of Y-cam cameras.Around the same time of the NC-316W purchase, the TriVision NC-306W cameras recorded a second security incident.  Two vehicles pulling six foot long trailers passed by the residence several times; the next day one of those vehicles, a dirty black Jeep Cherokee with moon roof and a loud exhaust, passed by the residence pulling a trailer - four times in the span of three hours.  On the fifth pass the Jeep pulled 180 feet into the driveway, drove around behind the house, and slowly drove back to the road with the two occupants apparently looking for scrap metal to steal.  The NC-306W cameras did a great job of tracking every move of the Jeep, but once again the bright white cameras were not much of a deterrent for would-be criminals.  Printed pictures generated from the security camera video were provided to the local police, even though the captured video was not sufficiently high enough quality to read license plates.  If the Y-cam 1080P cameras worked as advertised, they could have recorded video to allow reading the license plates - yet the cameras were still in the box waiting for the long promised firmware update.I recently noticed that TriVision released their NC-326PW 720P security camera in the same bright white bullet housing as their 640x480 (480P) cameras.  I ordered four of those 720P cameras.  I noticed a couple of days later that TriVision also offered a NC-336PW 1080P camera in the same bright white housing, so I ordered a couple of those cameras and will buy more when the cameras are in stock again.  The cameras are sold on Amazon by TriVision Tech, LLC, and much to my surprise a day or two after the orders were placed, I received an email from the TriVision tech support person that I was in contact with in December 2012 and January 2013.  The support person proactively emailed to me the latest firmware for both the NC-326PW and NC-336PW cameras.  That was a very nice touch, but it still surprises me that the company does not have an official website where their products are advertised/described and firmware updates may be downloaded.The NC-326PW cameras came preinstalled with firmware version 5.38 (build 20130423), while TriVision support provided to me firmware version 5.43 (build 20130620).  Other than entering a couple of configuration settings, I almost immediately upgraded the cameras to the 5.43 firmware version, which adds the ability to record three, five, or 10 seconds before a motion detection event, increases the recording brightness, and apparently fixes a couple of bugs.  The settings were not lost when the new firmware version was installed (for comparison, the Y-cam lost all of its settings each time the firmware was flashed).  The five second pre-motion detection recording (which helps compensate for occasionally late motion detection), combined with a 15 second split time is just about perfect when reviewing thumbnail previews of the recorded video clips using Windows 7's Windows Explorer.Positives:* Motion detection simply works.  The motion detection had little trouble picking up and triggering the recording of moving cars on a road 180 feet (55 meters) from the camera.  Wasps, birds, woodchucks, and skunks also have a hard time evading the motion detection, as well as just about every passing bug at night.  It should be possible to connect a $100 PIR device to the camera to reduce the number of false positives, but such a device decreases the motion detection capability from 200+ feet (61 meters) to just 40 feet (12 meters).* Works with the Multi-Live software that shipped with the older TriVision NC-306W, NC-316W, NC-107W, and NC-107WF cameras, but this software does not ship with this camera.  Multi-Live provides a quick simultaneous view of up to 36 cameras.  Multi-Live shrinks the NC-326PW camera's native 16:9 aspect ratio to a 4:3 aspect ratio without cropping the edges of the image.  The supplied Camera Live software is able to find the NC-336PW and NC-326PW cameras, but could not connect to any of the older TriVision cameras.  The MultiLive functionality in the Camera Live software seemed to be useless until I determined that I needed to click an icon near the bottom of the screen to add the detected cameras that were of interest (this step is not described in the otherwise excellent manuals).* Works with the IP Cam Viewer (Basic) app on Android (Motorola Xoom) tablets to allow simultaneous viewing of multiple security cameras, much like the Windows based Multi-Live program - just without audio.  The P2PCam264 app, which is recommended by the manual, is able to find the NC-326PW (and NC-336PW) cameras, but is unable to show real-time video from cameras on the Motorola Xoom tablet.* The NC Setup utility, which also ships with the older cameras, works well with the new cameras to quickly locate and help configure cameras that are still using DHCP assigned IP addresses (I suggest changing all cameras to static IP addresses as soon as possible - the older TriVision cameras were unstable when using DHCP assigned IP addresses).* Just like the older TriVision cameras, the NC-326PW records videos in Apple QuickTime (.mov) format.  Windows 7 and Windows 8 are able to play back that video format natively using the Windows Media Player, while Windows Vista will require a third party program to play back the video.* While the NC-326PW camera is advertised as supporting 720P recording at 30 frames per second, Windows reports that most of the videos are recorded at 22 to 26 frames per second, possibly to stay within the 4096kbps maximum bit rate (the default bit rate is 2048kbps).  Why is this limitation listed as a positive and not a negative?  There are no JPEG type large blocky artifacts in fast motion, as was experienced with the Y-Cam 1080P cameras.  The motion, while usually smooth, only loses a second or two of video while maintaining audio feed during skips that seem to happen in most 15 second video clips.  In good daylight, it is sometimes possible to pause a video of a vehicle traveling 40 MPH (64 KMPH) at a distance of 180 feet (55 meters) from the camera and determine the stylized hole pattern in the vehicle's wheels (the NC-336PW seems to produce a slightly sharper single frame in a video, so the 1080P camera might be a better choice for license plate recognition).* Roughly one percent of the videos asynchronously uploaded to an FTP server are unusable due to corruption (this percentage seems high, but it might be lower in other environments).  The video upload speed may be throttled to prevent one camera from consuming all wireless bandwidth due to rolling fog or rolling spiders weaving a web in the camera's view.  The throttling and asynchronous upload seems to work great - one of the cameras had six hours of spider web weaving spooled up on the memory card, while the camera maintained the specified maximum throughput until all spooled videos were uploaded.* Core functionality of the camera allows the camera to minimize wireless (or wired when using the integrated 100mbps RJ45 connection) network traffic caused by the camera - the camera does not need to continuously broadcast its video feed to a digital video recorder device for the video with motion to be captured (although the camera can continuously broadcast its video stream with almost no configuration).  With the configuration of two tasks in the camera, the camera is able to record motion triggered video to an installed MicroSDHC memory card (I use a SanDisk Ultra 32 GB class 10 card), and then asynchronously upload that video to an FTP server (I use a Synology NAS with the FTP service enabled).  With the two task configuration, the camera will continue to record motion triggered video to the internal memory card if the FTP server is unavailable (a thief disables the wireless access point or the NAS) - the Y-Cam 1080P camera simply stops recording video if the FTP server is temporarily unreachable.  Video may be uploaded to a NAS or Windows share using a single configured task in the camera; however, the camera will not revert back to using an installed memory card when the NAS or Windows share is unavailable.* Optional tasks are available to schedule periodic captures of still frame JPG images and send those pictures to email servers (the feature is not compatible with all email servers, the manual recommends Google's Gmail - not tested), FTP servers, HTTP web servers (not tested), and to storage (either the configured memory card or a NAS).  Additional optional tasks allow sending one or more still frame JPG images to the same destinations when motion is detected.* Supports multiple video stream types including MPEG4, MJPEG (no audio, although oddly the NC-336PW somehow included audio in the MJPEG steam while the NC-326PW did not), H.264, RTSP audio, HTTP M3U8, HTTP ASF, and JPG image (with a consistent filename).  The free VLC Media Player is able to decode and display many of the stream types.* The camera seems to work very well with Internet Explorer, on both Windows 7 and Windows 8 computers.  An ActiveX control will automatically download when the camera is accessed using Internet Explorer, allowing the live video feed from the camera to be viewed during camera configuration of the up to four motion detection sensitive areas.  The camera's Live View web page also uses this ActiveX control to display the live video feed from the camera on a simple web page.* When accessing the camera using Google Chrome, the web browser automatically prompts to download Apple QuickTime.  Once downloaded and the plugin is enabled, the QuickTime control is used when configuring the up to four motion sensitive areas, as well as with the camera's Live View web page.* The camera supports streaming playback of video stored on the optional memory card, allowing quick views of the video.  The older TriVision cameras required a much more time consuming process to view video stored on the camera's memory card, a process which downloaded the entire video clip before playback could begin.  The recorded video will play back using either the QuickTime control or the TriVision ActiveX control.* Video uploaded to an FTP server or NAS is stored in a single folder (directory) on the server, which allows quick review of the video uploaded by multiple cameras throughout the day.  The Y-Cam 1080P camera, in contrast, uploads video into a nested directory storage structure of \\ Year \\ Month \\ Day \\ Hour \\ Minute - that nested directory structure makes it impossible to quickly review video uploaded by one or more cameras.* The NC-326PW camera seems to have approximately twice as many vertical pixels per inch as the older NC-306W or NC-316W cameras - so each pixel in the older 640x480 cameras is now described by an average of four pixels. The horizontal area captured by the NC-326PW camera matches the area captured by the older 640x480 cameras, while the vertical area is cut short roughly 120 pixels at each the top and bottom of the image.  In contrast, the NC-336PW camera records an area roughly 50% wider than the older 640x480 cameras and a bit taller.* The recorded video in bright sunlight is very good if your computer monitor supports at least 1280x800 resolution (or 1280x720 resolution if watching the videos full screen).  On high resolution monitors, the captured video is slightly muddy in appearance on cloudy days and in the early morning/late evening.  In some cases, the slightly muddy appearance seemed to also indicate an occasional camera focus problem.* Allows remote viewing of camera video from outside the network (not yet attempted, but there seems to be no reason why this would not work once the network firewall was configured to permit connections and port forwarding was enabled on the firewall, should be a nearly automatic process with a router that supports universal plug and play (uPNP)).* Connects wirelessly to 802.11b/g/n WEP and WPA2 encrypted networks even when the network SSID is not being broadcast (tested with multiple Cisco Linksys E2000 routers acting as access points, and a Cisco Linksys E4200 router).* Automatic light intensity adjustment during the daytime, automatically switching to black and white night vision if the automatic infrared lights are enabled.* Offers two-level user access security to the camera for administrators and regular users.* Recorded video may be broken up into 60 second intervals (configurable between 10 and 600 seconds) to make certain that the video is transferred quickly to a FTP server - recording will continue for a user specified duration (configurable between 5 and 86400 seconds) after motion detection ends. Continuous recording is also possible, but only to the optional internal memory card.* Supports mobile devices (iPad, Android, BlackBerry) through third party software, as outlined in the manual (tested to work OK with the \"IP Cam Basic\" app on a Motorola Xoom when setting the camera manufacturer to Sharx).* The mounting stand, with a three inch diameter round base, works well for mounting the camera to the sides of buildings. Overhead mounting is also possible with the included male-female extender nut.  Screws and expandable concrete anchors are included to assist in mounting the camera.  The camera also includes a white (nearly) waterproof enclosure for the converter box that the camera connects to - the converter box provides power, wired Ethernet (and power over Ethernet), and digital I/O connectivity with PIR units, amplified speakers, and burglar alarm systems.  The white waterproof enclosure eliminates the need to drill a large 5/8 inch diameter hole through the building's wall to allow running the cable extending from the back of the camera to an indoor power source (for comparison, the Y-Cam 1080P camera does not include a waterproof enclosure and requires a one inch diameter hole).  With the white waterproof enclosure, a roughly 1/4 inch diameter hole will be required for either a Cat 5 Ethernet cable (if using power over Ethernet) or the end connector on the power supply to pass through.* Configuration is not terribly difficult, but is a bit time consuming when multiple cameras need to be configured.  The configuration process is easier than what was required for the TriVision NC-107W, NC-107WF, and NC-306W cameras, but the steps are roughly the same as required by the TriVision NC-316W cameras.* The cameras are able to automatically synchronize with external time sources (NTP servers found on the Internet, however the time on the cameras tends to drift a bit more than what is acceptable - roughly 30 seconds per week).* The power supply included with the camera has a very long cord (roughly eight to ten feet) which helps with installation. The cable extending from the back of the camera is a usable length for routing inside a building, although an extra foot of length probably would make installation easier for some locations.Negatives:* The perfect motion detection sensitivity and threshold values that work well for the daytime operation are slightly too sensitive at night time with the infrared night vision.  The camera will generate a lot of false positive motion detection events at night due to bugs passing by the camera.* Black and white night vision video is very grainy compared to the night vision video captured by the older TriVision cameras - the older cameras may have applied an extra smoothing operation to the captured black and white image.  The file size of the night vision video is roughly the same file size as the daytime recorded video, while the older TriVision cameras produced a significantly smaller night vision file size than that required by their daytime video.* When attempting to record at 30 frames per second (the actual frame count seems to vary between 22 and 26 frames per second), there are frequent pauses in the recorded video, similar to the pauses experienced with the older TriVision cameras.* The cropped areas of the viewable image restricts this camera from recording an area that is wider than the older 640x480 4:3 aspect cameras, and the recorded height is less than that captured by the older 640x480 cameras.* There is a slight bowing distortion of the video near the top and bottom centers of the recorded video, as well as near the left and right centers of the recorded video.* The recorded audio seems to have a tin-can echo effect that was not experienced with the NC-336WP cameras or the older TriVision cameras.  Turning down the volume from the maximum setting of 10 to 8 may fix this problem.* The recommended Android app for P2P video could not playback a live video stream on a Motorola Xoom tablet.  The included Camera Live software is not fully documented in the printed manual, making it unnecessarily difficult to simultaneously play back video from multiple cameras.  The Camera Live software, while it quickly locates the newer TriVision cameras, does not support the older TriVision cameras.* After installing the firmware update, three of the four NC-326PW cameras prompted for a username and password once or twice every time a link was clicked in the camera's configuration (this problem occurred with Internet Explorer on both Windows 7 and Windows 8, but the problem was not experienced with the NC-336PW cameras).  I was not able to determine the exact solution for the problem.  In one case, unplugging the Cat 5 cable from the camera so that the camera would work wirelessly fixed the multiple password prompt, while in another case I also had to completely shut down and restart Internet Explorer.The TriVision NC-326PW camera, at least with the 5.43 firmware, seems to be stable, and offers at least the same functionality (minus the vertical recording height) as the TriVision NC-306W camera that I rated five out of five stars in May 2012.  The price point of the camera is a bit high when compared to the wider and taller viewing area offered by the NC-336PW 1080P camera, but is price competitive with 640x480 cameras that offer similar capabilities.  The larger viewing area offered by the 1080P NC-336PW with just a small price increase, makes it difficult to justify purchasing any additional 720P NC-326W cameras instead of the NC-336PW cameras.  I highly recommend contacting TriVision support to obtain the latest firmware version before purchasing the camera; if no response is received from TriVision support, then consider purchasing a different product (even though the preinstalled firmware may be completely usable).", "Date": "July 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$489.00", "Features": "1280 x 720 (720p HD) Wireless IP Camera With Dedicated Free iPhone/iPad and Android Apps\nInfrared Night Vision to 15 metres and Weatherproof (water and dust proof) to IP67 Rating\nBuilt-in SD card DVR expandable up to 64Gb & Multi-zone Motion Sensor\nWi-Fi N & POE combo--------Utilising the most advanced Wi-Fi technology, the TriVision HD 720P range is our most connective camera to date.
