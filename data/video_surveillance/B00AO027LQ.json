The menu is simply yet detailed sub-menus for precise settings. The software for you pc that can be used to configure is even my user friendly than the menu on the DVR. The mobile software is awesome compared to the other i have used (QSEE, LOREX etc.) you can take snapshots and even record on your phone or tablet. So far I am on;y using 8 cameras have the other 8, will install them in the coming weeks, also bought another one recently for my friend. He was amazed with it when he saw mine and showed him the simplicity of the mobile software. Currently waiting the 8 channel for them to bring it back.", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00AO027LQ"}}
