This comes with no cords or anything but when combined with the cords is cheaper than buying the camera with the cords.It's relatively versatile and you can mount it anywhere. You may want to consider buying some separate screws to mount it though, the ones it came with didn't seems very long-lasting so i bought a few self-tapping metal screws.As described: this product works great outside, even in the summer heat and frigid winters.

I choose to install this camera OUTDOORS above my window, based on my main reason for buying it. If the RCA cables going to the camera were not \"hardwired\" directly to it's back. It would not have taken me 4 hours to complete this simple installation; the \"hard wired\" RCA AV cables presented much lack of  maneuverability in handling the cables from the camera through a drilled hole, thus making the whole installation an awkward time consuming experience, among other added unrelated issues.  I had to do more drilling than expected through a 10 inch thick window frame, which is constructed with a combination of hard wood, and concrete in order to fish the camera's RCA AV cables through that hole to the inside my house, the window frame situation ,I am NOT blaming on the hard wired camera design totally, but it figured into the overall problem to a great degree nonetheless. I am assuming most of you guys that gave this camera 5 stars, have bought it  mainly for INDOORS use,since such installation should take 15 minutes, and the maximum time approximately half an hour....but in my \"outdoor\" installation scenario, the AV RCA cables being \"irremovable,\" from the camera posed awkward problems,in addition to unrelated problems drilling a hole to fish the cable through a 10 inch thick window frame \"end to end,\" the bulky RCA cables tied to the fairly large camera, posed many problems. I mistakenly thought after finally completed creating the initial hole in the window frame that the bulk of the \"installation, was done; but  that was just the beginning, since there were much more \"re drilling\" done to \"widen\" the hole so that the bulky RCA cables that kept getting tangled up half way through the length of the hole in the window frame,required re-drilling\" to widen the hole, so I drilled again, and again, until I had a gaping hole of about 1.5 inches that was wide enough to fairly \"maneuver\" the awkwardly designed camera and it's bulky attached RCA AV cables through the hole into my house,thus connecting them to the monitor... The installation thereafter was completed within 15 minutes...The camera's AV video output is mediocre ,on the grainy side, but good enough for the price, however, I would NEVER buy any outdoor camera with the video-audio RCA cables \"HARD WIRED TO THE CAMERA\"  ever again.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Throw 30 bucks in the trash", "Author": "Dixiepartsman", "ReviewID": "R6L2CGX9RUDDU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Eliminate the middleman and just burn 30 dollars.

Any wind during rain will put water all up inside it's works. The multi-wire coming out the back is of small gauge and feels like it would easily break down over time in the weather and pull apart. It also is right in the middle of the back which interferes with certain positions of the mount, All of these things are tolerable/fixable in certain situations but the reason this one went back was that even by itself on an eight camera plug, it spent up to several minutes clicking back and forth in the morning as it came out of IR/BW mode into color mode. This makes the camera unusable during this time. Seems to be a light sensor deal and not power related.
