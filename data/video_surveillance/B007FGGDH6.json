{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Product For the Price", "Author": "Wayward Son", "ReviewID": "R39ZXXJO08RGWO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After our house was broken into in broad daylight, I decided to install some security measures. In addition to an alarm system, I wanted to install a camera to see what kind of activity there is around our place when we aren't home.A friend has a system with 16 cameras and a DVR. He has upgraded it to a better system a couple times over the last few years. For what it cost, and the work involved in hard-wiring all the cameras in (he has a 3\" hole in his wall where all the cables come in), I was not that impressed by the quality of the live feed or the recorded video.I spend a lot of time reading and comparing specs on these wireless cameras. Most of the reviews I read on all the different models included some shortcomings. The biggest complaint people had about this particular camera was focus issues. Some of the reviews talked about how to fix this problem yourself if you happen to get one that is not adjusted correctly, and I am very tech-savy, so this one seemed like the best option for me. As it turned out, mine was fine right out of the box. The picture quality is better than any of the cameras on my friend's system - some of which have been upgraded from the originals that came in his bundle.I had no problem setting the camera up to work over my wifi, and was also able to configure my router so I can view and control it remotely over the internet from a web browser on any computer anywhere. If you are not comfortable changing settings in your router, (it was pretty simple for me, but I'm a computer programmer), you might need a little guidance to get the camera onto your network, and also to make it web-accessible. I'm sure there is lots of info out there on the web on how to do this, and it is simple for anyone who dabbles in this stuff, so just have that geeky kid next door help you if you get stuck!Here are some of my observations on this camera:1. The software lives in the camera, so you don't have to download anything onto your computer to use it. This is nice if you have multiple computers. The software works best with Internet Explorer. It does work with Firefox, but the features aren't as slick. I have not tried it with a Mac (Safari.)2. To set up recording, either motion activated or continuous, you need to open Internet Explorer as an administrator. Just right-click on the IE icon and click \"Run as Administrator.\" Pretty simple! If you don't do this, you won't be able to change the default recording path (where the recordings will be stored on your computer.) The default setting is 'C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents', and since the computer I dedicated to the camera doesn't have a folder at that path, I had to figure out  how to change it.3. The only thing I was a little disappointed in, but completely willing to overlook because of the great price, is the motion activated recording. The camera does not have an infrared motion sensor on it. It senses motion by recognizing changes in the image it is seeing. The problem with this, is that if the light changes, it thinks there is motion, and it records. Each motion event causes it to record for 1 minute. Each recording is a separate file on your computer. There is a box you can check for \"motion detection compensation\" that is supposed to reduce false alarms caused by changes in lighting. I haven't seen where it has helped at all. Changing the sensitivity (or \"Motion Detect Sensibility\", as they apparently translated it), does help, but then a person needs to be closer to the camera before they will cause recording to start. The false alarm recordings are numerous on days when a lot of clouds are blowing through and periodically blocking the sun.4. The email feature is pretty cool. You can set it up to email you six pictures each time it records something. You can even set the interval at which it takes the pictures. This is in addition to recording the video. I have mine set at 2 seconds, which works out pretty well. I also set mine up to send me a text message with pictures each time it records. The nice thing about this, is that you know right away if it saw something. I made the picture message work by adding (my cell phone number)@vzwpix.com to the list of email addresses it sends the pictures to. This works for Verizon subscribers. You will have to look up the format for other carriers.5.  If you use Dropbox or something similar, you can set it up to store the videos there, and view them from any computer or device. There are also smart-phone apps you can use to view and control the camera. I am using 'TinyCam Monitor Free', which works pretty well. I haven't had a chance to try any others yet.6. Be aware that this camera does not have any infrared LEDs for night vision. The area my camera is in is well lit, so this was not an issue for me. I can pan it around to a dark area. Other reviews stated that its low-light capability is pretty good, but in my opinion, it's not that great. In a very dimly lit area of my yard that I can see somewhat by eye, the camera can't see anything.7. There is a cool feature that can be set to pan the camera to one of your preset locations as soon as it sees motion. This is nice if you were playing with it and didn't set it back on an entryway or other desired surveillance area. The presets are easy to set and retrieve. They even remember the zoom level the camera was at when you set them and put it back there for each individual preset. It doesn't always hit the presets spot-on when recalled, but it's usually pretty close.8. Be aware that for recording to work, your computer has to be on, awake, and connected to the camera through a web browser. I had an old laptop that I dedicated to my camera. It is an older 32 bit, dual core with 3GB of ram, and it works just fine. It and the camera are both connected to the network over wifi. I just have it set up to stay on when I close the lid, which turns off the screen. You could do the same thing with a desktop  PC, and just have it turn off the monitor after a time. You just can't close the browser or allow it to sleep. The camera will still email you pictures without being connected to a computer, as long as it has an internet connection through your router.Hopefully this review will save you some time. I would have liked to have known this stuff when I was shopping. The bottom line is, this camera has some shortcomings and limitations, but for the price, it is really cool! I would have paid 2 -3 times as much for a wireless tilt/pan/zoom camera with a true motion sensor, higher resolution, and wireless-N capability (which it would need for the higher resolution), but there was just nothing out there that I could find, even in that price range, with those features.", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera but for the focus", "Author": "Maryann Novak", "ReviewID": "R1944HMPZNH9J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If it wasn't for the focus problem this would be a great camera for the price.

So here goes. The first item arrived in good shape typical box and packing.  The camera was as advertised and instructions  were  based on intermediate tech savvy folks on set up.  Issue I had was the camera in pan mode hesitated at a certain spot.  After hesitation the basic boundaries of the pan became smaller and smaller.  I could reset the boundaries by going to one edge of the camera span and kept clicking to go in the lock direction.  So I decided to return camera and got return auth.  I then ordered replacement.  Received replacement inside the usual air pack amazon box. However the internal product box had damage on corner.  Open box and basically had a electronic mess the dome was broken from the base and the electronics were hanging down. I then got a return auth for the new one as well.  Since the replacement never happened I have been using the original setup and have no issues other then the above hestiation in panning and then having to reset panning area by the above method.  The zoom works and picture quality is as expected for this type of camera.  Wireless reaches farther then expected and connection is good.  Colors are washed out but again as expected for this type of camera.
