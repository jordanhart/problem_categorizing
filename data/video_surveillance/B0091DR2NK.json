I just wanted to know what went on while I was sleeping or away.I am fairly technically inclined so setup worked out without a hitch. I experimented with temporary camera mounting locations outside for about a week to get an idea of the limitations of the system.The system works well. Daylight video quality is good, night time is ok but you are not going to recognize a face on a moving person even with the adequate IR lighting. Also note that the IR lighting is pretty focused and if there is an object lit up closer than what you are trying to see (say, a shrub) the brightness of the background image will be dark @ night. Regardless, you will at least see what is going on. Regarding the video quality, this is not the free flowing video you see from a camcorder/Youtube/cell phone video camera. It is much more coarse. 3-10 images a second depending on signal strength. It is adequate for the purpose.I ended up purchasing 2 systems + an extra camera. 5 cameras total. Note that a camera can only sync to 1 screen.The internet viewing of live video is ok from my galaxy tablet or work PC. No audio is transmitted thru web access.I really like the \"tablet style\" interface. Carry it anywhere within camera range for viewing and makes camera aiming a breeze.  Viewing, sorting (by camera) and deleting video recordings is pretty easy.The motion detection/recording works pretty well. Fast changes in lighting will trigger it as will a bug flying in front within 4' on low setting @ night (snow and rain will trigger it too). Reflections of car headlights on windows or surfaces will trigger it along with moving branches....but so will something like a cat in the dark.I have had 2 screen lockups that required a 3sec pin hold in the reset button.Wish list:Wider range of motion detection, not just hi-lo-off. 5 steps would be nice.An actual alarm that would sound if motion was detected. The thing has an alarm clock built in but no alarm for motion...silly. Maybe a FW update will fix this in the future. The only really stupid omission...Would like to see the same camera on 2 screens.The audio is choppy at best and generally unusable. Oh well, bonus \"non-feature\".As the title says, you get what you pay for.I have about 800 into my system(s) and am happy.You must recognize the limitations of the wifi-ish transmission method.  You need to pay attention to how much structure you are transmitting thru. 3 walls is about the max @ 50', I have ordered a higher gain antenna for 1 camera that is quite obstructed, 2 bars works ok but more gain is needed for a higher frame rate.This is not a $3000 hardwired system with all the bells and whistles but it might just fit your needs like it has mine if you understand the limitations and work within them.Aug-2013 update. Still happy with the system. I have 6 cameras now. The phone app was recently updated and is more stable now. Bought bigger memory cards for both bases. The summer bugs continue to be drawn to the IR @ night. Minor annoyance but I rarely watch every recording for a day unless there is good reason.", "Date": "February 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Uniden G755, Incompatible with Windows 7 64", "Author": "HenryM", "ReviewID": "R1TPOWA8K2TZYX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Having purchased the Uniden Guardian Camera surveillance system model G 755, I am extremely disappointed with it's performance, or lack therof, together with a lack of support from Uniden Co. Having said that, if you are buying the system to monitor a baby, or maybe if you have a retail store and want to see what is going on from your office at the back, then I think you will be happy.I had intended using this for home security and found it gave a good picture of the 200' driveway leading up to the house. I installed the monitor in my home office and hooked it up to a desktop PC through a router. In addition to the picture on the monitor I was able to get a clear picture on my computer monitor. The software provided for the ability to record from the pc either continually until stopped or momentarily for a snapshot, and to store such images on the computer hard drive.  No matter what I did and how many times I downloaded the software and reinstalled I could not make this feature work at all!  I also installed the software on a laptop but could not get an image of any kind. In fact I tried it on three different laptops without a result.  I also tried installing it onto another desktop pc at my office for remote viewing - again with no success, even though this was hooked up to a differnt isp to that at my house.Uniden's website advised to make sure that the software used was current and to compare the version with the current one. However, there was nowhere on their website showing the version of their software available for download. I came to the conclusion that there was only one version, period! There were no updates in spite of claims to the contrary.Frustrated with the time and effort I had put in, I emailed Uniden with details of my experience with remote viewing. Their site stated that I would receive a response within 3 days. Two weeks later I have not had a response. In desperation I phoned them and was on hold for 40 minutes, I finally got through to someone who did not seem to have a clue and totally unfamiliar with the product. I was put on hold another ten minutes before I had someone who was familiar. Bottom line was that he seemed to think that the problems were because I was using windows 7 64bit. Funny thing I did get an image on my home desktop but not with any of the other laptops, all of which were running the same OS. I was told that they are working on a solution but at that pont cannot give any timeframe, but would email me when they have a solution!Following that useless contact, I tried installing it at my office onto an old pc which was running Windows XP, and yes, I was able to view the image remotely, although the snapshot and record functions did not work. As all of my laptops are running Windows 7 and I have no intention of downgrading those operating systems, I am returning the Uniden System, and will make a point of not buying anything made by that company again, not because I have experienced bugs but because of their deplorable customer service.", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good compact security monitoring/recording system w/basic remoting capabilities", "Author": "Pragmatic", "ReviewID": "R4M4HJJL4W7U8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good, basic, easily set up home/small business security system with basic recording and remoting capability to a smart phone etc. (if connected to a router for web access/communications). The system has good, but not high definition resolution of 480 X 272, 320 x 240 (QVGA). The cameras have B&W; night vision capability out to ~40 feet (20 IR LEDs, low light sensitivity or 1-8 lux) and the picture sensor is a OV7725 1/4' color CMOS technology with a F3.6mm H:55 V:44 lens.Display: The portable 7\" display is very convenient and a great feature but its rechargeable battery is limited to ~ 5 hours before needing to place it in the data/power cradle for recharging - so it will not make it through an full eight-hour or more business day. You need to plan to have the cradle/dock attached to AC power in a central/primary location in your home or business.Range: The system claims an operating range of up to 500 feet (152 meters) in open/line-of-sight situations but depending upon building/wall construction ranges can be as short as 50 to 200 feet. The cameras conveniently have industry-standard SMA RF connectors and you may want to get better rated (dBi) directional antennas (e.g. 5dBi panel) if you are experiencing a reception problem with one particular camera due to interference or attenuation (range, building/wall construction). Auxiliary/higher-performance antennas or amplifiers are available at RF/WiFi electronics vendors or via Amazon. One popular antenna brand is Alfa. Be sure to get the correct SMA gender connector. Foscam antennas, as an example have reverse SMA gender from industry standard, and will not be the correct SMA gender for the Uniden cameras, while the (example) Alfa antennas generally will be correct.Power: While the system is wireless for video/sound, it does need wired 120vAC power for each camera and also the 7\" diagonal (4\" for G455 system)  cordless/portable video display's data/charging cradle. The system cameras and display unit charging/data cradle use (120vAc to 5 vDC 1 amp) \"wall wart\" power supplies. Each power supply has a 6 foot cord and the camera cords include an additional 6 foot extension for a generous total of 12 feet for the cameras. If you don't need the extension for a particular camera, you can use in on the display cradle cord. The display (not cameras) has a rechargeable lithium-polymer battery that recharges when display is in the cradle/docking station. Display battery life is up to ~five (5) hours.Additional Cameras: You will likely want to get two expansion cameras for a total of four cameras. The display can pair to these and display them in a quad (4) camera display. Be sure to get the newer Uniden FHSS cameras specifically compatible with the G455 or G755 systems because they are newer/different than the older less expensive Uniden cameras. The specific expansion cameras are CG45 in black, and CG45W in white available on Amazon or via other vendor. The basic G455 and G755 system comes with two black cameras. The cameras other than outside color are identical in function and appearance. Some reviewers complained of new/additional camera pairing difficulty but we experienced none of that - pairing very easy simple/quick. From the pairing camera screen, tap image 3 or 4 (1& 2 are pre-paired at factory for you), then during the 60 second count down, press the pairing button on the new un-paired camera. Repeat for the fourth camera as applicable.Storage/Recording: The G755 systems includes a 4GB SDHC memory card good for ~60 hour recording and can be upgraded to 32GB SDHC card (currently Jan 2013 ~$22) equating to ~480 hours of recording capacity.Summary: We feel these systems should be also offered with four camera as a value package because at ~$130 each, two expansion cameras boost the total system cost to just over $600 which is not insignificant for a system of these modest capabilities/specifications (and is approaching low-end commercial security systems prices that have full-up DVR capabilities), thus overall 4 stars vice 5 for value.", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Uniden Guardian G755 (Camera Good - Support BAD!)", "Author": "Bradley H. Fredrick \"FredrickUSA\"", "ReviewID": "R9SLSYA357GTQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The cameras set up easily. Only issue I had was a wasted 45 minutes getting the cameras to sync with the unit. I kept thinking to myself, this has got to be easier. I'm a network and computer dude with a Masters degree, and couldn't get these to see the base unit.Then, I simply unplugged the cameras, let them reset, and 20 seconds later they connected. So, if your cameras dont sync with the base unit, unplug them and let them resync.I also added two additional cameras (ordered from Uniden as they shipped immediatly and for same price) Amazon appeared to show a long delay in shipping. These cameras synced perfectly in just about 20 seconds each as described in the included manual.Pro's: Set up is pretty easy; good portable stations. Can zoom in on camera and hear audio.Con's: Not sure yet if audio is recorded when cameras record on motion detect. Customer service is pathetic. had problem getting unit to sync online over Internet. Kept getting errors. Typed up issue to Uniden, 7 DAYS LATER they responded with \"What OS?\" That's it. Thank goodness my house wasn't on fire, really Uniden, 7 days. That was pathetic! Other Con, recorded videos are .mp4 (not that big a deal) but they're only 320x200 sized, and that's a bit small for detail. Also, understand that each time the unit records from a camera, that's s separate video. So each day a folder is created for the date by the unit, and you can literally have hundreds of files in there. Problem is, how to you link them into a contigous file for easy viewing without having to open each video to view them. I sitll have not found a FREE app to do this but am still researching. Would be nice to drag and drop the days videos into an app and have all of the .mp4 files strung together. Lastly, the unit will NOT automatically overwright the SD card. I find this a flaw. You must monitor your card usage. I found 32GB SD cards in the low $20 range, so I bought two.I wish the unit had the capacity to 1. Record to a higher resolution, 2. Record to an unattached data store (NAS drive etc.) 3. Would overwrite the card storage automatically, 4. Give option within own software to string the day's videos into a single viewable stream. IF Uniden could fix these, it'd be the perfect system.Installation was easy enough with a long drill bit. When going through the walls, of say a garage, leave bit through the wall on the inside (drill from outside to inside) then before removing the bit, tape a string to the end of the bit. Pull bit out, and withit comes the string. Next tape end of string to end of the camera connection cord, then pull string back through, thus feeding the power connector into the inside of the garage etc. Remember to use a drill bit big enough to pull through the knunckle of the power connector, so use at least a 1/2\" paddle bit. Get a long paddle bit with at least at 10 to 12\" shaft on it. Then the job is super easy and much faster with two people to tape string and pull back through, or you'll be up and down a ladder a few times for each camera.Bradley", "Date": "November 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not a good unit for security", "Author": "Reviewer 1", "ReviewID": "R35TAD079YJC9L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I would suggest that you read other reviews carefully before purchasing.  I purchased this unit at a big box wholesale club (and later an additional camera from Amazon)  after reading some of the reviews assuming that I could overcome some of the issues.  The sad part is this unit could be a really good unit for the price except the manufacture seems to not invest any resources in making the unit better.  I believe this unit was built on the platform that they build for baby monitoring.  As a baby monitor it would be great; but the inability to use any other third party monitoring software is a red flag.  Also the Guardian II app for droid is weak and has only on feature (snapshot the ability to capture an image from the camera to your droid phone.

The specs say they can do 150m, but we found the range to be much less in our test environment at the office. The cameras run in the 2.4GHz frequency spectrum (using frequency-hopping spread spectrum and encryption), and they can, in some instances, cause interference to your wireless network (unless you are running a 5GHz Wi-Fi network). We noticed this after experiencing very slow file transfers (under 500KBps) to one of our laptops while the Uniden Guardian was on, and faster transfers (up to 10MBps) while the unit was off.\"I will be returning the unit back to the vendor because I simply can't use my wifi network when this unit is operating.Hope this helps.Best regards.", "Date": "November 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "UNIDEN 455 GOOD...but...", "Author": "Edgar Milford", "ReviewID": "R33OI7ZTKHP41R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased the 455, which came with two \"outdoor\" wireless cameras and a small base station with plug-in video monitor/touch screen controller. The base station has ability to connect to your existing internet router by a wire. The monitor acts both as a method for viewing any or all of the cameras linked to the system (you can purchase another two cameras for a maximum of four). While the monitor is docked to the base and connected to the internet, there are no images available on the touch screen... but the assusmption is that when you dock the monitor, you will be accessing the images over the internet. The monitor has batteries, so you can carry it around locally and still view images from the cameras. You can choose to see all four cameras at the same time in quadrants, or touch one of the camera images to just view a full screen image from that individual unit. Can also take advantage of limited \"zoom in\" feature, which enables you to make part of the image fill the whole screen. Image quality is good. The Infrared night vision feature is good. The two outdoor cameras that come with the kit are moderate sized. I bought a third \"indoor\" cam which is much less obvious.Accss with the iPhone and iPad internet apps is good, though the software makes you do two rounds of confirmation of what site you want to view and what camera. Does not appear that the iPhone software allows all of the functionality of the touch screen. The system does not have two-way audio, in fact I did not hear any audio one-way over the internet either! I have not been able to access the video using my desktop Mac or my portable Mac, and woner if access over internet is limited to a smartphone or PC.I have not rigorously tested the motion detection features of the system, and I do not think that the system has noise activation of the audio or video recording, though I might be mistaken.

The image from the cameras is very good even at night.  I have one pointed at the back of a house and from thirty feet away the night image is bright and clear.I am a bit worried that this system will interfere with wifi networks.  If I keep the cameras much longer I will pull out a spectrum analyzer and measure the impact on the wifi frequencies.  Keep in mind that wifi is designed to deal with interference and that current wifi standards support two different frequency bands and these cameras will only impact one of those two bands.  It would be nice if Uniden was a bit more informative about this on the packaging.I've had a large number of software issues with this device:-Their web site, when it is even up, will not accept the DID of our unit.  This makes it impossible to register for the online service and thus far I've not been able to reach the phone support staff, mostly due to my schedule and that they don't have 24 hour support for their camera systems.-The touch screen device is buggy and many menus do not work when the unit is connected to the internet.  I need to disconnect, open the menu, then reconnect the network.-The device will not download software errors, claiming an unspecified error.  This occurs regardless whether I allow DHCP assignment of a network address or manually assign the network addresses.-Speaker function sounds rather scratchy and noisy, not sure if it will be usable.  This is true on both cameras, inside or outside of the house.-Website for registration wants your address, which seems dangerous as once their website is hacked, other folks may end up being able to see your camera output (so change your system password) and know where the cameras are located.  Your camera's IP address may also give away location information too.-Internet Explorer browser support only.  Really?  So I guess those Chromebook and MacOS users are just out of luck.  It may be that standards based programming was beyond the skills of the software engineers, in which case what other parts of the code are sub-par?-SMTP is greate, but why not also support microsoft active exchange sync?The power switch on 4 inch display unit we have is a bit sticky.  Not sure how long it will last.Not sure how well the internet viewing works as our system DID is not accept by the portal website.  The manual says the cameras can be viewed on your local network without an internet connection, so I'm hoping they'll also be visible to the internet via appropriate configuration of DynDNS and firewall rules.Update:The portal site had me download a firmware upgrade and using the SD card sideload it into the display device.  This worked fine, but the DID the portal claimed it would give our device was not seen, the DID remained the same.  Funny thing is that the instructions for the upgrade assume the DID will change and gives no steps for when it doesn't...So first problem is the upgrade and the instructions are a fail.  Second problem, why doesn't this device upgrade itself over the internet like say a Roku does?Update 2:Finally got the portal to work.  Think I had to use a number different than the DID, but now I can see the cameras on the internet so I up'ed the review by one star.One camera failed after a couple of weeks and sending it back was no trouble at all.  After a few more weeks I received a factory refurbished replacement.  Not new, but at least it works.Discovered that the memory card fills up and there is no automated method of deleting older videos.  I had hoped the oldest would be over written by the newest.  Software still feels a bit beta and non-intuitive, including the app.  If the company releases a decent software upgrades I'll revisit this review.Cameras work great at night.

Do you want to see if anyone broke into your home while you are on vacation?  Sorry, you can not access any of the recorded video remotely!  And any decent thief will pull the cameras off their mounts, taking the receiver, including all the videos with him.  Also, if he cuts the AC, there will be no video as cameras have no battery backup.Second, you are supposed to be able to view your recorded videos on the system's receiver.  I am able to see a few of them, but apparently not all of them.  The only way I've been able to check the activity on the videos is by pulling the SD card out of the receiver and putting it in my computer.  Then I can easily sort thru the videos.Don't be miss led by the malarky about an alarm, siren, etc.  It functions as an alarm CLOCK!  That's it. The system will not alarm when motion is detected in the living room at 3 AM!  It will take a nice picture, though.

I had to return them all.  They all did not work with the latest wifi \"n\" and that means you have to back down your wifi to b and g band only, and then the connectivity on 3 different models were not very dependable (even in the same room as the router!).So I continue to look on line and decided to give this one a try via Amazon - and would return if it didn't work (which I expected it not to - like the others I have tired.)Well it is by far the best system I could imagine - and worked out of the box (including 2 extra cameras) 1000% better than what I even hoped!1.) I love having the 7inch touch screen that is portable - very nice to take with you rather than being tethered to a PC in our kitchen or one of the other PC's in the house as the other cameras that I had were somewhat limited and did not have a portable monitor.2.) Having its own dedicated 2.4ghz wireless built into the monitor - AKA it's own wireless all-in-one system.  Meant that I didn't have to try and tweak my current system of 1 main station and 3 repeaters to make the cameras work.3.) Range is good - we have a 7500 sqft house in which the monitor is primarily at the center of the house in our kitchen work area.  While the range is not 500 foot, it is most likely around 200 if you have a few walls in between.4.) You turn it on, it took 3 minutes to pair the other 2 cameras I bought with the included 2.  This system is up and running in 10 minutes or less - it will take you longer to unpack than to get up and running.5.) I spent 2 more hours setting the cameras up outside at the 4 entries to our residence and it works great as a remote viewing station to see who is at our doors, UPS drop off area by our garage, pool area, etc.  very easy to install on the mounts and 4 screws and were ready to go.  You will have to have power plugs relatively close to the cameras to get power.6.) The clarity is awesome - very clear at day and remarkably clear at night.  I would give it (compared to the others I tested - when they worked) a 8/10.  It is on par with cameras that I tested in the 300 each range - but for much less!  The night vision on these are better than any I have seen and good range of 30 - 40 foot night time visibility.7.) I am please with the handheld unit and the functionality of it, pretty easy to use and configure different settings.If you are looking for a great system with all the needed functions of a very good security system - snag the uniden advance wireless (7 or 4 inch) both are the same product with just a smaller monitor on the G455 unit.

Other issues....", "Author": "Spumanti", "ReviewID": "R1VM0CBR4PV6MJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought the Uniden Guardian G755 at Costco.  My biggest gripe about this product is that there is no way to remotely view the 2 minute motion detection clips that the system records on the SD card.  Yes, I get the e-mail notifications - or in my case, MMS messages to my phone, but they do not include the 2 minute mp4 clip, and there is no way to access these clips remotely.  So, I don't actually know what set off the motion detection alert.  I have the app to view the real time surroundings from my Android phone, and it works fine, but the inability to view the motion detection clips is a deal breaker.Note also that this system does not capture motion detection images, either, so when it sends you motion detection e-mail notification it consists of nothing but a text msg or e-mail that says \"Motion dectected by your Uniden Guardian system.  Camera x\" and a timestamp.  This is all you get - no image, no video, and no remote access to your saved image or video.  So, there's no way to know who or what set it off if you are away from home.  Frustrating.In summary, it seems that the product may have future promise, but the software is currently lacking.  Therefore, I will return this system to Costco.EDITING TO ADD OTHER PROBLEM:  The latest problem I'm having is with the touch screen.  It is often unresponsive or it behaves erratically and starts selecting opposite ends of the screen from where I am touching.  Then, it wants to recalibrate but tells me calibration has failed.  I am having to use a pin to hit the reset button frequently just to get out of calibration mode.  Again, I will probably return this to Costco.Some positives....I have since bought a Foscam IP Camera - I like that I can access motion detection images and video remotely.  However, I must say that the Uniden G755 image quality is better, and the motion detection works way better - it seems to actually capture 2 seconds before the actual trigger where Foscam is always late on the capture.  This is a really nice feature.  It's too bad these Uniden cameras are lacking in other essential features.

( I actually found a small plastic screwdriver I used as a \"pen\" for the screen because it was so unresponsive to my fingers alone.)Overall the system is simple and (should be) easy to use, but I cannot get into the system in a manner I find more convenient and faster to use - through my PC.  (I'm online all day long and use technology and computers for a living, so my desk space is the best place to keep track of/ view a security system.  Or it should be.)  I tried several browsers before I remembered they want you to use Internet Explorer (the most broken, most compromised browser in the history of the world).  Other vendors have products that use almost any popular browser to control and manage their systems, so right now I can't remember why I bought this one...Big issue is that you have to register at Uniden to get a link to an Active X plugin for your browser so you can talk to the damn thing.OCX/ Active X plugins for IE are out of date.  Nobody does that anymore because it's insecure.  No web browsers, but old versions of IE, do this anymore.It's all besides the point because in order to use a PC browser to watch your cameras and control them, you have to get an OCX plugin from Uniden.  But I can't.  Their registration page keeps telling me they cannot find the DID/ UID that is on my brand new Uniden device.Do I want to trust my home security to a company that uses outdated web browser plugins and also can't keep track of it's own inventory IDs for it's own products?  Nah, I don't think so....I wish I had seen some of the other reviews before buying this thing.From the PCMAG review of this sytem:\"There is a Web site through which you can also view the Guardian system on a PC (Uniden Video), which requires you to create an account and register your product on that site. However, it also requires an OCX plug-in and only works with Internet Explorer.We could not get it to display video at all during our tests.We used Uniden's email support to try and get a resolution, and while the responses were relatively fast (24-48 hours for each query) and generally helpful, we still couldn't make the plug-in work for us.\"===========The system has promise, but if I was only able to use the tiny screen to manage several of these, it would get tired really fast.  I have to click things several times to get a response from the handheld.  If you have motion detection on, which works quite well, and you have a few dozen clips to scroll through and watch, it's tedious to do it with the handheld.  I can imagine it would be easier with a full-blown interface like the browser on my PC, but that's all I can do right now - just imagine.What really bothers me is that I've handled tech support for friends and family for years, and even though there is a fair share of user error involved, in this case there is not.  Uniden makes it too difficult just to give you options for handling an otherwise really decent system, so I can see where the frustration for your \"average\" user may come in.  Who has the time?There are plenty of four and five star systems on Amazon that users said are easy to setup and convenient to use.

It was fairly easy to install the system (had to actually read the quick install directions). Downloaded the correct app (Uniden 2). However, I went online at Uniden and set up the account first. The system does not work with any Mac -- but that was clearly stated online and in most of the paperwork. It is designed to work with Windows system pc's. I'm ok with that. It works perfectly with my iPhone/iPad and my wife's iPhone/iPad anywhere remotely. The monitor that came with the system is very clear and on the iPhone/iPad (s) the picture quality is even better. The wireless function is superb and works as it should from one end of a 3,000 sq ft home to the other (and out in the yards front and back). Hey this is not a $5,000 dollar system, but the picture quality is just as good for a lot less money. Adding cameras is also easy (pairing). So, I truly don't understand the complaints. I've not had to call customer service and by the previous reviews am glad about that. If I didn't have an iPhone 4S or better or an iPad 3 or better, I'd not buy it unless a Windows user.

Before my review comments I would like to mention that I am tech savy and I do understand \"how stuff works\". Before trying this I tried Lorex, Swann Wired systems and also Unidens another wireless model from Fry's.After trying wired and wireless units my recommendation is buy this unit if you are monitoring activity around the house while at home, like kids/wife at home having the comfort of seeing who is at the door, not having to go and peak outside or if you are at home and want to watch maybe pets, kids playing outside, deliveries or solicitors so you can watch a movie with the portable lcd on the side along with your popcorn.If you are planning to use this to watch your home outside of your home, I mean via internet it is a bad idea because of several limitations that makes this great device useless.Features that doesn't work or not there:1. Sends and email with just text and does not send the image when motion is detected.2. Remote viewing via app is frustrating and primitive, cannot view all cameras at once but works well with instant streaming of the activity though.3. Cannot record video on your mobile device, can only take snapshot if you are watching the screen at the timeof the activity.4. Motion sense email alert is hot or a miss and is not reliable.5. Remote monitoring via web browser is a joke. It is very primitive like Windows 95 and as other reviewers mentioned it is clucky, buggy and compatibility issues but when it works it is ok but have to view one camera at a time. I was using Windows 8.1 though.6. Video is recorded in clips of MP4 videos on an SD card and have no option to view remotely or system does not overwrite the old ones if it is full.7. Do not sound alarm when motion is detected so Uniden expects us to sit in front of the monitor and watch it all day maybe night too.... ridiculous. Maybe they shoulkd label these as \"Baby Monitors\" rather than Surveillance system....8. No ability to record on external drive or NAS drives9. Power cable should be through the mounting stand so that it is not exposed outside for easy tampering.10. For the remote monitoring to work the LCD unit must be docked into the base unit.Good Features:1. Simple to install and no wires no mess.2. Portable wireless monitor is a big plus so you can take it around the house.3. Wireless capability is great and have no issue moving around my two bed room 2000 Sft house with walls etc. Didn't notice any interference with my WiFi as other reviewers mentioned.4.

The monitor works great and while it was sitting on my desk, the motion detectors in the cameras worked as stated. It does not work off your home wi-fi system. The monitor has its own receiver for the video. If you want to view the video over the internet, you need to plug in a CAT 5 cable to the back of the monitor and to your router.Now, the reason I returned the system....I am a retired detective and forensic video specialist with a good amount of knowledge in the video surveillance arena. The compression on this system is the stand H.264. If you are using this for home security, the compression of the video and the data that is lost in the air is is too much. The video looks great on the screen; however, if you record video and then view it off the disc on your computer, you would not recognize your own mother. While walking under the camera with the monitor in my hand (during daylight hours), the compression of the video was so great that most of my facial features and clothing details in my shirt were not recorded. You could see them on the monitor, but not on the disc when I reviewed the video. The night video was even worse....ghosting and no facial features at all on the video. This will not help law enforcement or a jury identify a suspect that breaks into your home.I returned the system and will keep looking for a wireless system that will meet my needs.", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good?

Coudn't settle on one system as I still want to expand my research to as many samples until I get comfy with which one I want.  Then I happen to be at Sam's Club one day and I saw this Uniden Guardian G766.  Checked the reviews on amazon and found several happy customers and almost equally unhappy customers. What the heck, I'll just pick it up and pretend that the unhappy customers didn't exist.  Paid $349 plus tax.  Connectivity from camera to main unit is awesome. On one camera, its separated by 3 walls and 70-80 feet, no problems, image quality is great. The other camera is closer and just one wall separates.  After I hard-wire the main unit to the router using the included ethernet cable, it forever attempts to connect to the internet. This is where the word \"frustration\" is redefined at its best. It never connected to the internet except for a couple minutes when I power it down and power it back up which it connects to the internet for a couple of minutes and the connection drops and the error message will say \"connecting to the internet, please wait\". Yeah, I wait 2, 3 or 4 days and it never connected to the internet. I'm interested in being able to check these cameras on my iphone when I'm away from home since I work nights.  2 weeks later, I started to gather the packaging so I can re-package the unit and return it to Sam's Club. Image quality is great, everything else is a POS.  Took a nap, when I woke up, I saw the globe icon signifying \"connected to the internet\" (without the running dots).  Wallah!! Checked my PC and ran the OCX software on my Windows 7 starter netbook and yes!!! there's my surveillance camera, can now be seen on the internet.  Ran the iphone app and BINGO!!!  While I was on the freeway on my way to work, I can check the cameras via my iPhone on the go.  Great!! I immediately planned on writing a review on this unit regarding my \"natural high\" experience with how great this unit is.  As soon as got home from work in the morning, I turned the unit off to see if I can turn it back on with no problems.  Pressed the \"connect to the internet\" button and it's been trying to connect to the internet for more than 36 hours now.  Sam's Club here's your Uniden Guardian G766 and give me my money back.  And by the way, how come you don't see G766 model on the Uniden's website?  It only mentions G755.  If you can make this unit connect to the internet using the included ethernet cable, please share it.  Otherwise, this unit is a $350 piece of toy. Find something else. Unless you just want an in-house surveillance camera. Then this is good enough.Update 3/6/13:  I have found the trick (or the right way) to keep the main unit connected to the internet.  So, you can now see 4 stars on my review. I had it with 3 stars on my initial review based on being difficult to connect to the internet. Now that I'm able to see the cameras on my iPad and iPhone, I think this unit is PROBABLY one of the best in this price range. I say probably because I havent tried other units and I'm just basing my wild comparison on negative reviews of others in this price range.  Very good connection between unit and camera (80 feet with 3 walls in between, gives me 1 bar on the signal scale), picture quality is awesome even with 1 bar. I am now recommending this Uniden Guardian G755/G766 to anyone looking for a quality surveillance unit within this price range.  I can also view the cameras with my HP Netbook using Windows 7 starter. I have not yet enabled the video recording mode because there are a couple of palm tree leaves slightly in front of my Camera #1 and I dont want the system to record the video triggered by the constant moving of these leaves. However, I was able to snap a sample picture of my daughter as she was approaching the main door (from the outside) where my Cam #1 is mounted. I told her to stop for a moment so I can take a picture and check the image quality (this was taken at night, and my front door is lighted with a 75 watt incandescent bulb). Picture quality is better than I expected. The reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the add on cameras I think are a little expensive. I just purchased one camera yesterday directly from Uniden (amazon is out of stock) and it costs $129 plus tax and shipping, comes to $153. I paid $349 plus tax @ Sam's Club, main unit and 2 cameras for mine. The camera is well built, metal casing and feels heavy & strong but the price could be lower.Update 3/7/13:  I'm really frustrated now. While continuing to tweak my Uniden Guardian to connect to the internet, I was looking at the monitor when I saw the Fedex guy drop off a box. Yes, its my third camera which I paid $153. Wasnt excited since its useless for now. Cant connect to the internet.  Box still unopened as I write this update. An hour later, I went to Frys a mile away from my house to buy something for my home theater. Stopped by the security cameras section to see what they have. Well, I saw a heartbreaker: they have the Uniden Guardian G766 (same as mine) for $344 plus tax. No big deal, $5 cheaper from what I paid at Sam's Club. But when I looked at the box next to it, its the GC45 camera, same as the one I just got, price is $110!!! When I saw online that amazon was out of stock, I thought buying it straight from Uniden was the way to go. I have to find out and see if I can return this camera to Uniden, box still unopened.", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "simple and inexpensive security solution", "Author": "E.

Amazon gives the best price but you cant count on their estimated shipping time. I cant say that the system was easy to set up because there was absolutely nothing to do. You just plug in the cameras and monitor and its up and running. Pairing the other two cameras was also simple and easy. I drilled through the interior and exterior walls in the desired locations, and fished through the power cables sealing the holes with plastic cable bushings and caulk. There was no need for the long power extension cables that came with the cameras, I plugged the cameras into nearby outlets which i previously installed plug in surge protectors. The cameras cover a large area and the resolution is very good. I have high speed internet so there are very few signal interuptions, but the signal range on the camera is nowhere near whats cited on the package, my furtherest camera is 80 feet from the base staion with only two walls (one interior and one exterior) and the signal is 1 to 2 bars at best. if you have a slow network, the distance from your furtherest camera is over 100 feet, or if your has to penetrate several structural features; this might not be the system for you. The motion detection and email alert works all to well. At the low setting it picks up the slightest movement. between camera adjustments, triming trees and bushes, and discouraging spiders from building webs around the camera at night for warmth; I got the nightly email alerts down from 49 to 8 or 12. The change from night to day and day to night activates the motion detection on all four cameras. The Iphone Camera App works well, but there is a lag time switching between cameras. As stated by just about ever reviewer of this product, its a shame that you cant access the recordings remotely. All my computers are Apple products. What sense did it make to be able to use an apple iphone with this product, but not an Apple computer.

I have accessed the online images using windows XP, and Windows 8 Professional with no problems. It currently WILL NOT WORK WITH A MAC COMPUTER online. I hope Uniden will add a Mac version so we can view the videos on our Macbook Air!When you go to the [...] to view the cameras, you MUST read the instructions at the bottom of the page regarding downloading and installing files from Microsoft.com so the P2P (peer to peer) will connect the base station with your computer. There is no audio with the computer program or the mobile apps.If you only want to monitor the video at home on a local network (intranet), then make sure you shut off Internet transmission. Also, if you turn on the power saver setting, the Base station LCD will shut off after 2 minutes of not being used, but will automatically turn on for 2 minutes if the system is recording from motion detection.I have also installed the app for my iPad, and it works perfectly. I can access my live camera images from the iPad on the AT&T; or WiFi connections, but like the computer version, there's no audio. The image you see when you open the app is a snapshot of the last image seen on your previous connection to the cameras. You need to swipe the window to the left to bring up the live video screen and give it a few moments to finalize the connection and bring up the live view. You can record video or snap shots from the iPad application.The compression codec (h264) used with the system is efficient as it compresses moving parts of the video, with minimal compression in still sections of the image. This keeps \"blocking\" of the video to a minimum. The audio quality is not very sensitive, and is not one of the system's better attributes.All in all, for its price range, the Guardian G755 is fine for indoor and outdoor use at home and for general business security, but if you need camera resolution to see fine details in the video images and higher frame rates, look elsewhere, but expect to spend much more, and you will likely need a wired system, not wireless.", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "EXPENSIVE UNIT ONLY GOOD FOR A YEAR!", "Author": "Ralph G.

Big bummer.  I would really like to have the system send me a notification when motion is detected...and then instantly view what is going on while it is recording.  Maybe a firmware fix in the future will change this.I've mounted the cameras on opposite corners of my house.

I called Uniden's support number, and after about 15 minutes I talked to a service rep who knew what she was doing.  The responses from their online Q&A; were completely wrong.  The app has no iOS7 compatibility issue - the problem the online folks were talking about was completely different and not major.  The service rep guided through the app reinstall and setup in about ten minutes.  I suggested they take a hard look at their online support processes and personnel, because they are driving customers away.UPDATE 4/4/14 - Uniden continues to ignore any problem reports related to their iPhone app not working with iOS7 on a 5 model.  I hope prospective buyers take my experience to heart when shopping for a security camera solution - in fact, for any technology that Uniden offers.  They do not support their products.UPDATE 3/22/14 - After another four weeks of frustration over the lack of response from Uniden about this problem, I am ready to take it up with the FTC. The last time I followed up with Uniden via their problem reporting system, I found they have removed the entire problem history from their site, and no longer respond to my problem reports.I think I am being quite reasonable about this issue - their app simply does not work on the iPhone 5, and the system is useless without that function.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I bought this system and spent nearly as much again to have the power feed installed.  Worked fine until I replaced my iPhone 4 with a 5s.  Uniden has blown me off repeatedly with various messages, always closing the problem report when they do.  Their last message says that Apple updated their security  features on iPhone 5 and 5s, and that I have to contact Apple to resolve my problem with the Uniden app!I hope every prospective Uniden buyer reads this and understands that the company sells products that are not supported.

The unit is a complete disappointment.  The software on the tablet style base station is some of the worst I've ever used.  It is littered with obvious bugs in the unit.  The worst example is that from the home screen, you can't interact with the tablet in any way if you are connected to the internet.  Once you unplug the ethernet cable, the device works flawlessly.  If you plug the cable back in once you've gone into the settings screen, you can use it normally.  You just can't use the internet connectivity while you are trying to use anything on the tablet.The cameras are also very poorly made, as are the mounting brackets.  Of the four total cameras we have for the system, two have broken already.  We were very gentle during the installation, but the nut that seals the wire exiting one of the cameras snaped in two.  Another camera has this weird issue where half of the picture is a different colour than the other half.  Tapping the camera changes where the divide happens, and it can be tapped to work properly sometimes.I work in the mobile phone operating system industry.

Let it get full and it loses its reason of being as a security recorder ... by not recording anything!- Motion detection is set off constantly by  almost everything even dust and mist, quickly filling the memory- no way to delete multiple video files from memory without formatting- Multi camera Scan function works for a few minutes then goes back to 4 camera static split view- The unit displays in the wrong aspect ratio, making everything appear severely widened (4:3 is fed from the cameras and stretched to 16:9)- no daily recording ability, but they provide 5 one time single use slots for recording, which is useless because you must completely reschedule it every 5 days if you want make any use of it, requiring intense menu diving and wasted time... You give up on the feature after the 5 slots are finished.- no ability to save files automatically to external drive or PC for archiving- wastes a lot of the users time and becomes completely useless and ceases to function if left unattended for more than two daysIf it wasn't so cold out (-35) I would take the cameras down and return them but I decided to keep them for now, and come springtime I will find another system and dump these because this system is a failure.

I called Uniden and they told me to separate both monitors and don't crisscross the cameras with the existing cameras from my G455 system. It still created minor conflict with both systems. There would be a delay viewing the cameras on the screen when you enlarge or minimize on the monitor ( a white loading circle and black screen that lasts 30 seconds or so) but eventually come on to be viewed.

As far as Tech Support, that doesn't sway me one way or the other, these days \"NO ONE\" has any tech support worth the powder to blow them out of the water anyway so you cannot rely on them or what they pretend to know. Today if you don't know it yourself you simply should not buy it. Tech support is generally some people hired off the street with manuals divided into Branch Type problem solving, \"Problem \"A\" = Turn To This Page --- Problem \"B\" = Turn To The Other Page, that's it, a pre-printed problem solving manual with no technical savvy behind it.None of them have true technical knowledge, you can't single out Uniden, they are all the same way - crude. I had one exception for a garage door opener provided by Buick (Home-Link) I think was there name, the Tech Support people for HomeLink Tech Support actually knew the product and had the answers (thank you Buick & HomeLink) but they were an exception. * When I bought this my thinking was as follows:(1) STAND ALONE UNIT not tying up my computer - I have too much connected to the computers as it is, this system does not need a computer to operate, thank God for that. Leave my computer alone already and let me use it for other things.(2) SIMPLE OPERATION, it works easily and does not have to be routed through several systems before I can get an image of someone at my door. My wife hates to learn a million new techno pages every time something comes out, cell phones, programmable refrigerator - washers - coffee makers - entertainment systems - i-Tunes (changes every week) - printers - answering machine - copiers - gee wiz man it doesn't end does it, a new techno manual for everything. It was nice to see a straight forward setup easy to use which my wife (or me) can operate without being frustrated for an hour.I am pretty tech savvy and I'm the Go To Guy in the neighborhood for any technical things so getting a break on this was nice to see.(3)  No Wires - (of course the cameras have power wires), nice to know I didn't have to drill and run wires all over the house for an afternoon and then listen to how to dam wires show here and there and blah-blah-blah...., this is a very Big Plus.For house security this is a good basic system that simply does the job, they have better technology coming out all the time but for what it is this is nice with some solid positive features. If you think it through before you tackle the setup it should go easy with little or no frustration.  I have been running mine for a over one year and it's been fine.The newer one they came out with has features I like a lot but I'll stick with this one for now, I could end up buying one every six months the way new technology goes.For under $300 you should not expect HDTV and Surround Sound but for the price this is tough to beat, it has operated just as they say and so far so good.Again - for the money you'll be hard pressed to find one better, maybe the Uniden UDS655 (hahaha, another very nice unit with nice options - maybe nicer - hehehe.... look at that one too.)I just installed the Uniden USD655 for a neighbor and that one is pretty darn nice, pretty darn nice indeed.

I started doing some searches and based on price the G755 looked pretty good. I don't mind shopping, but I don't like being sold stuff so I really look at user reviews. Some were good and some were not so much. I saw complaints about range and read in the manual that it would go 500' in an open area. I laughed at that cause I don't live in an open area, but really my property isn't big enough to go that far anyways. The thing that I wasn't surprised to find out was that the cameras need wall power. I though it would be cool if they were battery powered but then I remembered all the times I let my cell die and was glad they weren't. I did have to use an extension cord though to get power to one camera but it was not too bad. Installation still sucked though because I hate getting into my attic then getting out to go outside and running back and forth. Word to wise plan it out and try to use vents or openings that are already in your over hangs to avoid drilling holes for the power wire.The computer stuff I had 0 trouble with at least on my PC (gotta love XP), laptop was a different story. Some people said they had trouble with 64 bit Windows 7 and I had a time finding out what my lap top had. I sent an email through Uniden's web site (I don't do phone support) and after a few days (it was teh weekend) they told me how to check. They also told me that windows has 32 and 64 bit versions of internet explorer? And that I should click on the second one in the start menu. That was more than I want to know but when I did that it started working. On my old XP PC I got a pop up about trusted sites or whatever and told it to add the site and I could record videos to the PC no problem. I had to manually add the video page to the trusted sites on the laptop for it to work.The part of this that I was really excited about was the cell phone viewing. I kind of panicked when I saw 2 apps in the iPhone store but they were free so I downloaded both. The first asked for a UID which I didn't have (mine has a DID) so I deleted it. The gold logo app asked for the DID which I was excited I already had, but then it asked for a password. Long story short come to find out the password is actually listed as a security code. Put it all in and boom it worked. I could view both cameras and take snap shots. I texted my wife a few pics of the front walk, to cool. I tried it on the wife's iPad (it used the same app as the phone) and it worked to.So overall for the price for the price and features this thing rocks.

Once running it provides a reasonable quality image day and night as long as there are no bright street lights facing it or other bright lights. Bright lights wash out the screen at night.The biggest complaint I have is that the software on all three units refuses to work for more than five day in a row on any of the three computers attached to it. Vista, Win7 and XP. In rare instances the software will record for more than 4 days in a row and extremely rarely will it record for over 10 days on 750 GB dedicated hard drives or the new 500 gb hard drive used for it. It will not do so on any hard drive. It crashes and wants to send data through internet but in the 2 yrs I have had them nothing has been done to make the software work. They are so paranoid with their software protection scheme that  it makes itself crash every 4 days. In that case you have to reboot the computer and relaunch the software. I have complained to Uniden but they answer that they received complaint but dies there. Been waiting 2 yrs for them to fix the problem. Their telephone help desk has no idean of how to solve the problem other than giving you a new pasword.Be aware you need to downloade a codec from Uniden to view the files on  your computer without using the uniden software.

That said, this is a great little system.  I've had trouble at my mailbox, and decided to get this instead of a Glock.  It installed very easily, mostly because I had AC power close to where the cameras are positioned.  The farther you are from power, the more difficult it might be.  As soon as I turned on the base/video screen, both cameras came right up.  There is a certain amount of readjustment needed, especially at night.  The infrared lighting off of the camera is quite bright, and will cause quite a bit of flare on the screen if any object is near, and in the path of the lens.  No big deal.  I have been pulling my hair out trying to get this system to work with the internet, and especially my iPhone.  Turns out to be a cockpit problem.  If I had actually READ the instructions, i would have known that I was using too many characters in my password.  Also, the system wants Internet Explorer; not Chrome, or Firefox.  So there.  You need to download a Microsoft file (linked from the Uniden site), And READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!!!  Other than that, it works fine.  The pictures are clear and bright.  You are not going to be able to read license plates at a distance, but it does a great job, especially at this price point.  I'm amazed by the iPhone app. It's not as clear as the PC or base unit pictures, but works quite well.  It's pretty neat to be able to eyeball my pool from anyplace in the world!

It's anything but 'real time'. I may have some setting wrong as I've only had the package 5 hours, but I'm not overly impressed at this point. It all works, as advertised - but the frame rate has be very concerned. Even in some of the Uniden videos, pay attention to the frame rate on these, they are slow - very slow. I have another Panasonic stand-alone Wi-Fi camera - works very good - pan and zoom, and much better - close to - real time video. Not sure what to think about this system - at this time.scUpdate: I have returned the Uniden system. Although working fine, I'll wait for a total wireless bundle - battery operated cameras. There is no perfect system out there today. Alarms would be nice (sound) should motion be detected and having to provide AC to the cameras was a bit of a hassle - although could be done. Also, the battery life on the display was very short - this needs to be increased. Uniden should provide one more A/C adapter for the monitor - think about it, you want (need) to leave the monitor base plugged into the internet, so you'll want that AC adapter attached to the base, then you may want to have the monitor taken out of the base and put into the location where you sit -but the battery power is so short, this is not real practical. You need one more AC adapter for this remote location. This system is 'close' to what I'd want, and even with Costco's 'deal' is was not worth it for me. It is easy to set up for the most part.

I tested the app on my iphone and it worked from my home network.  However, when I switched off the wifi and used my 3G, I couldn't connect.  I went to the main unit/monitor and forgot to allow access to the WAN or Internet.  It was actually my fault for not reading the quickstart carefully.  Once that was activated I was able to see the images from both cameras.  Other than that no problems viewing on my iPad, iPhone, and Windows XP and 7 PCs.  Regarding the PCs, it seems that Uniden's online access won't work with Mozilla's Firefox. It will, however, work with Internet Explorer.  Make sure you download the indicated drivers on their page (there should be 2). The range seems very good and I wanted to test it before actually mounting it up high on the exterior of my home.

Great system and not having to do with complicated wiring makes for really a simple set up.I wanted to put the monitor in the master bedroom, however, the unit requires a direct ethernet connection and my house is not wired.  I found a wireless bridging switch from Amped that is a wifi repeater with Gigabit switch and paired with the Uniden allows me to reposition the main monitor/tablet near my nightstand.

Reason being your cameras if set to record will capture hours of bugs and trees blowing in the wind. With that said, you do have the ability to adjust sensitivity or select not to record. The ability to connect over the internet hasn't been tested as of yet. However, I'm looking forward to the ability to monitor my home on my smart phone.

It would be nice if they fixed the issue before selling the product.  Hopefully they fixed the new models.On to the review....This camera had marginal video quality and did not hook up at the distance that was claimed.  I work at a place that has a fair amount of electrical interference but think that 50' line of sight should have been close enough.  The video capture modes work well.  We set it up for auto record on motion which worked better than I thought it would.  One thing I did not like is that you couldn't have both cameras video pulled up at the same time on a web browser.

I tried to set up the e-mail notification system (sends an e-mail when motion is detected) but I can't get it to work.

You'll see what happened, but won't be able to pin it on who dunnit unless they have a unique peg leg and drive a van with a giant bug on the roof.  But the system is easy to set up, and works as advertised.  It does not loop recordings- it stops when the memory card is full, then no more.  So you have to swap out or erase the card on a regular schedule to keep any video evidence of events.  Not good for unattended monitoring. They should fix this in firmware to loop record.  For primary deterrence, I'm hoping it will encourage opportunistic burglars (meth heads) to go to a different neighborhood when they see they have been caught on camera as they approach to ring the doorbell to see if anyone is home.  That is the most common form of burglary now adays in our neck of the woods.  If nobody answers, they go around to the back and smash in the back door.

The cameras pair with the display right out of the box. Each camera has a five-foot built-in power cord and an additional five-foot extension.  Installation is simple -- just mount a bracket with a swivel ball end that attaches to the camera. FYI - the cameras have 1/4-inch screw mounts that will work with any standard photo tripod mount. The wireless display makes it easy to review and adjust the camera position during installation. I'm using two cameras within 60 feet of the base station and have never lost a signal.The display charges in the base station and can be used off the charger for about two hours. It has touchscreen controls that are not as sensitive as using your smartphone, but still handy to set up recording modes, view recordings, and manually start and stop recordings from the main screen. If you're using motion detection settings, the unit records two minutes of video each time it's triggered by motion seen by the camera, and you use about 4 MB of memory card space for each two-minute recording.Motion detection can be set to low or high sensitivity, and mine has been triggered by everything from birds flying by, to a squirrel crossing the driveway and precipitation. Snowfall will trigger the motion detection, so you'll have lots of footage to review if you leave the system on overnight during a snow storm. Also, if you mount the camera where it can see traffic on the street, it will trigger with every car that passes.Reviewing the footage is simple -- you get a calendar view showing days when recordings have been made, then touch to view a list of recordings for each camera. You can erase from that list directly, or review and quickly erase anything that's not needed. Because the system starts recording on the first sign of motion, you'll know within the first 10 seconds of footage whether it's something you want to save. The unit uses standard-size SD cards that are very affordable and easy to transfer to your computer for archival storage.The infrared night viewing feature is very good - it looks as bright as day, but in black and white. The camera field of view is good too. I have one camera mounted about 10 feet up on my garage that can view the 25-foot width of driveway and down it toward the street for about 30 feet. Resolution is not super-sharp -- you can't make out license plate numbers or faces unless the camera is a lot closer.The Internet viewing feature requires that you keep the display in the base station and connect the base station to your router via an Ethernet cable. The recording feature is disabled when using the Internet viewing, but you can take snapshots using the smartphone app or when viewing from your computer browser.All in all, it's a great product for what I need -- a few extra pairs of \"eyes\" to keep watch over my property.

I will let you know if anything goes wrong but so far so good. Oh yeah if your going to buy this system defiantly put it in a protective camera housing so it doesn't get vandalized or stolen! Cause if you live in a bad area someone might try to steal the camera's from you if you plan to put them outside I can't stress that enough!

I know the Uniden Guardian cameras for both the G755 and the G455 are also available in White, I just wish you had the option to choose which color you want with each G755 or G455 packet.

This product does something really bad to your 2.4 wireless devices. As long as the cameras are off, everything works fine. Turn them on and kiss your wireless devices goodbye.I couldn't get the product to connect to the internet to update the firmware and view the cameras from the web. It just sits there forever trying to connect. When I finally got an email from UNIDEN support (after 4 days of emails and phone  calls), they said I couldn't use a router and I had to plug the base unit directly to the cable modem to get it connected to the internet. That directly contradicts the documentation and web pages that discuss plugging it into a router.So if you want this to connect to the internet (forget your LAN) you have to dedicate your modem to it.", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Weak signal and crappy iphone app", "Author": "Keith McCabe", "ReviewID": "R1TP51HCKQLQE2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I installed both cameras at each corner of my house.

The user interface is decent and easy to set up.  The iPhone app works great as long as my iphone is connected to the same network that my system is installed.

I got windows 7 just Bing the system works like a charm.the picture quality is good same like my expansive wireless router where i put the second camera, I got the same amount bars on my devices. let say the picture is perfect period.It can be challenging for some people but that wireless thing is on the beginning stage be patient more easy system to may be at the corner. The reason why I paid for my $349.88 and I add replacement for 29.99 to guaranty upgrade when more sophisticated items become available.Update: I got a full bars on both cameras because at the beginning I didn't raise the antenna on the LCD. The night vision is working very well i can see small item at my doors steps very clear. remember you need to set the camera how to display the picture.
