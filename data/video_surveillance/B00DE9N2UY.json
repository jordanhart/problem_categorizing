{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Scam company...", "Author": "Erik R. Tank \"Erik Tank\"", "ReviewID": "R20Z2P2W1YOTYY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Company doesn't actually exist.  When I emailed their support (because my camera was making a clicky noise every 5-6 seconds which fluctuated in noise level to the point where it would wake up my 2 year old son), I got redirected to some other company for support.  When I asked why they were helping me, they said the email came to them.  When I asked for help and restated my problem, they said I'd need to contact VeevoCam for support.  I forwarded that email to support@veevocam.com and it went back to them again and they told me the same thing - I needed to contact VeevoCam.  I asked how I could get in touch with them as their website doesn't even exist.  They said the only thing I could do was to replace the camera, but I would need to contact VeevoCam to do this.  (So they were avoiding the question on how to get in touch with VeevoCam).  I finally emailed a one line email that said \"Please tell me how to contact VeevoCam's support\" and then I got an email back from them which had 8 other people of different companies CC'd and all they said was \"Please replace customer's camera\".  I waited 3 days, then \"replied all\" to everyone and asked what the procedure was for an RMA or repair.  I never did get a response.  After a week, I decided to return it to Amazon and spend the extra money to get a foscam FI8921W V2 instead.  I am SO happy I did.  The foscam works in any browser, has a mount (which I thought I'd have to buy seperately), much faster, way better image quality, etc...The VeevoCam wasn't bad when I first played with it, I wouldn't have returned it if the clicking didn't wake my son up.  But I'm sure glad it broke so I could try out the Foscam.  When there is no company to stand behind a product, they shouldn't be selling a product.  <period>", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "No support from seller or manufacturer", "Author": "Catalin Ilea", "ReviewID": "R2XA4UAOC0LEAL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased the camera 5 months ago, and it seems it's a very bad quality. It stopped working after 5 months. I tried to replace it but, the seller has a return policy of 60 days. Besides that, it has no support from manufacturer. Worst purchase I ever made.

I tried to set up the cameras to record on both sound and motion triggers.  I could only get one of them to recognize it's micro SD card.  Recording to the micro SD card was only achieved on note camera, and when tried to view the recording it would crash the software that was included with the cameraThe cameras would not connect to the veevocam app on my iPhone half the time, and I have had nothing but trouble with these unitsYou may be better off purchasing a cheap DVR system instead of 3 of these.", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Pretty good for the $$", "Author": "Skippy", "ReviewID": "R2H7YZ9E3R68FB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Physically, this is a pretty good camera.  Smooth movement, good picture and looks good.  However, the software/firmware needs a little work.  While it's for the most part functional, the viewing program doesn't allow zoom.  In fact, the only way to use zoom is the Internet Explorer version of the viewer, which works great when the camera is hooked up to the router.  After playing with it for a couple days, I still can't get it to work in WIFI via web browser, but it does using the software version of the viewer or on my smartphone.  I have yet to get the email alerts to work.  Also, the only instruction manual I received was the quick start guide.  I found a more detailed manual under the actual manufacturer \"Tenvis\" under the name \"IPRobot3\"  Even in the \"Advanced Manual\" many of the instructions aren't really clear unless you have a pretty good knowledge base for IP cameras.Bottom line.....this is a pretty good product and the best you'll find with the high resolution and zoom for less than $100.  But if you're expecting something to just plug in and go (PnP), you're going to be VERY Frustrated and disappointed.", "Date": "November 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "short wireless range", "Author": "elklodge", "ReviewID": "R4NTTYKEKE8GH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I played with this camera for days.
