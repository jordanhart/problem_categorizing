After hearing that Dropbox support was released I decided to bight the bullet.I've use many IP cameras and they all have there issues, but Philips has done a great job hiding these issues from the user.Network configuration was very simple, plug it in and point the iPhone screen at the camera, the camera then configured itself.  All I had to do was give it a name.Streaming video via wifi and 3G on Verizon worked without a hitch, I did notice on 3G that video was delayed about 15 seconds, and on the same wifi about 2 seconds.I configured the camera to my dropbox account and turned on the motion detection and to my amazement video clips and thumbnails were being uploaded to my dropbox account.  Nice!You can view your dropbox thumbnails and videos from the app, which is nice.All and all I'm fairly impressed, this is a huge evolution from other cameras I've used.  Now they just need waterproof outdoor.Things to note:You can view the camera on a computer, but the experience is not the same as the app, it is much more limited.I haven't been able to find an android version of the app to try yet, I don't know if there is one.I don't think you could setup this camera without a iPhone/iPad/iTouch.", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Getting better...slowly but surely", "Author": "Whitney Lassini", "ReviewID": "R333S06SI1D3ES", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was just as frustrated as many of the One Star raters when I first got these cameras. However, I must say that since they have updated the software, the camera firmware and added Dropbox support, I am now pretty happy.I think people that are complaining that these are not good for a security system do not understand what they really are. They are simply home monitors and they are always going to be at the mercy of your home network speed and internet bandwidth. If you want a truly reliable internet security camera you are going to have to spend A LOT more money.I have been using these to keep an eye on some home contractors, the housekeeper, my pet sitter and just see what the cats are up to while I am at work. They work great for that. I would NOT rely on them to alert me to a break-in. I have a separate (much more expensive) monitored security system to do that.I really like the motion sensor feature. I know immediately when someone comes into the house. However, I really wish there was a way to set up times to stop the motion sensing. The thing alerts like crazy when I get home from work until I reduce the sensitivity. Then I have to reset in the morning.I have only had these a few months and in that time Philips has made HUGE improvements in the functionality. I am hopeful that they will continue to do so.", "Date": "November 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Easy to use, but limited network security cam", "Author": "Gaz Rendar", "ReviewID": "R3CE9NL2V48LDF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Philips In.Sight home monitor is a stylish and simple way to watch over your home while you're away, but be sure to check the limitations before you buy.For starters, do not bother purchasing this device unless you have at least one iOS device, preferably an iPhone.  Do not purchase this device as a long term security solution unless you're going to stick with iPhones as your current and future cell phone.  Also, as of mid Oct 2012, this camera doesn't really work with iOS 6.  It worked under iOS 5, and I'm sure they'll eventually update the app, but if you need a security camera to work right now, I would check to see if there have been any app updates in Oct 2012 or later.HARDWAREAs for the In.Sight itself, it is a rather nifty looking camera.  It feels solid and durable, and it was thoughtfully designed.  It comes with two bases, one that can be installed on side walls, and one for a ceiling/table.  It also comes with mounting drywall screws.  The camera has strong magnet on the bottom of the unit, and that allows it to magnetically connect to the ceiling/table base.  It can also be tilted and swiveled to any desired viewpoint with ease thanks to these magnets.  The side-wall mount comes with a ball joint arm, which also permits a range of viewpoint possibilities. A long micro-USB cable (included) is used to power the camera.  A electric wall adapter is supposed to be included in the box, but it was missing in my package.  Luckily I have several wall-to-USB electrical adapters and one of my replacements worked.  Anyway, as long as you mount the camera anywhere near an electrical outlet, you'll be fine.INSTALLATIONInstalling the In.Sight couldn't be easier.  Just plug it into the wall and then download the Philips In.Sight app from the Apple App Store.  You will not be able to install the camera without getting the iOS app.  Fire up the app on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch and then create a Philips user account (Name, email, password, and security question are needed).  You will also need to be on the wireless home WiFi network that you want the camera to connect to.  The SSID and WiFi passkey will need to be entered into the app's software.  Once you're logged into your account, a Qcode will be displayed on your screen.  Place the Qcode a couple inches away from the In.Sight camera and after about 1 minute, it should connect.  It's incredibly simple and takes the guess work away from trying to assign IP addresses to individual devices.PERFORMANCEThe camera's performance can be best described as \"limited.\"  Again, you need to install the device with an iOS device.  I currently have a WiFi-only iPad 2, but no longer have an iPhone.  Installation was a snap and I could see through the camera while I'm on my home network for 2 hours straight.  While I'm away from home (when I actually want to use the camera), I can only view it for 5 minutes at a time when I can connect to a WiFi network.  There are no Android or Windows Phone or Blackberry apps for this thing.  Additionally, the app is not optimized for iPad usage, meaning you have to look at it with the \"mini-iPhone\" screen transposed onto the iPad's screen.  If you want to be able to view your camera for longer than 5 minutes, you'll have to pay a premium for the app ($25).  Depending on when the box was put on store shelves, it may also advertise that you can set your camera to begin recording when it detects motion and upload a clip to your private YouTube account.  Well, sometime in June this feature was disabled.  Recently, Philips lets you record these motion detected clips to your DropBox account instead.  I don't have a DropBox account, so I don't know how well this works.  But there are no alternatives to record to say, a SkyDrive account.  The video itself is passable, if there is some light around, but it's only VGA quality.  The darker it gets, the grainier the picture.  Don't expect an HD video to be played on your RetinaDisplay.  Finally, as mentioned above, it's not really compatible with iOS 6.  All I can see are updated snapshots, the streaming video does not consistently work.SUMMARYThe Philips In.Sight camera is a simple security solution for iOS users.  Yes, there is a webpage Java app that you can use, but you still need an iOS device to display the initial Qcode to set up the camera.  And the webpage display is even more limited, as you can't really adjust any camera settings with it; so don't think about using this camera primarily with the web browser, it isn't a viable choice here.  This camera should only be purchased by iOS users (I would almost say, only iPhone users, as my WiFi iPad is limited here) who want an incredibly simple security camera solution.  The draw here is an easy set up for brief, 5 minute house checks.  There are other networked cameras out there that do more for a comparable price---they're just more difficult to install.  And unfortunately, until this thing works smoothly with iOS 6, it's difficult to give it any stars.UPDATESeveral people have commented below that this camera now has an Android app too, a year after I wrote my review.  However, I cannot confirm or deny this as I don't have an Android device at the moment, nor can I tell you what phones it is compatible with or what version of Android is required for the app to function properly.  I recommend checking the Google Play app store yourself before purchasing this camera if you plan to use it on an Android device.", "Date": "October 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Trouble Connecting to Wifi", "Author": "Rae Ann Eckstrom", "ReviewID": "R2S4V1DVUBOPEO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I liked the look, price and simplicity &  purchased 3 monitors.

Or at least it will, once the bugs are worked out.To use this system you'll need an iPhone or iPad, and a Wi-Fi network at the place you want to monitor.The actual hardware is neat.  Small at only 3 \u00be\" high with the base, it easily hides among the knick knacks and stays unobtrusive.  The base is neat too.  The monitor and base form a cup and ball socket that are held together with magnets, so the monitor is free to be positioned in any direction.  A wall mount is included, and the magnetic base can be ceiling mounted.  The AC adapter is simply a USB power adapter.  A thin, white unobtrusive 8 foot cord connects it to the monitor.As neat as the hardware is, the software is clunky.  The In.Sight monitor works with iOS devices along with the free In.Sight app, available in the App Store.  I'm using this camera with an iPhone 4S running In.Sight software version 1.9.2.  My monitor firmware version is 35057.  My early experiences with this app and the monitor operation in general were discouraging; the app would fail to find the monitor, or the video would fail to load or the app would quit unexpectedly.  Though the first couple of days were rough, since then operation has been much more reliable.  Maybe I had a bug that worked itself out.  Still, there are tell-tale signs that this was a new product that had a difficult time in development.While you're watching a monitor though your iPhone or iPad, you have buttons available to save a still picture or video.  Still pictures go to the camera roll on your phone, but videos get uploaded to your YouTube account.  This isn't working as I write this.  Philips' FAQs section on their website says there's an issue that Philips and YouTube are working to resolve along with an apology for the inconvenience.  This is the biggest issue I can see, no video recording.You are supposed to be able to view the In.Sight monitor from any web browser, but when you call up the web page, you get a big fat error message.  (Update:  The error message is gone and replaced with a message saying \"Web view available end of July\").There are discrepancies in the instructions that give away the revisions this product must have gone through late in the game.  Nothing that will trip you up too badly, just things like menu items being in a different place than indicated and, yes, the mention of an Android app that doesn't exist (yet).Finally, I have to say that the In.Sight app is cumbersome to use.  It is slow and has to go through a few steps before you can see anything.  Philips made it all automatic (you don't have to enter passwords or anything) but if you're in a hurry, it's frustrating.  If you're viewing a monitor and want to go back to a menu, you have to wait while the app is \"Stopping Streaming.\"  A lot of the latency is caused by encrypting the video stream so the teenage hacker down the street can't tap into your bedroom camera, so maybe that's a good trade-off.While the service to use this monitor is free, you are limited to 5 minute viewing sessions.  You can have an unlimited number of sessions, but if you want longer sessions, you must upgrade to premium service and pay a $25 annual fee.  I was worried this would mean the In.Sight app would nag me constantly to upgrade, but it doesn't.I could go on listing all kinds of minor complaints like crappy video quality.  (I know this is a security camera and not a memory maker but, yeesh, I didn't know they still made cameras this bad).The promise of a great product is there.  Audio and video alerts work just fine, are highly adjustable and reliable.  Push notifications work well, but arrive about 20 minutes after the fact.  There's a lot to like here.  Imagine being on vacation knowing if someone broke into your house, there'll be video of it waiting for you on YouTube.  Software revisions will turn the In.Sight from a frustrating device to a super useful one.  And we are talking about Philips here.  Not exactly a fly-by-night company.  I believe they will get this right.  They just should have done it before they released the In.Sight.UPDATE:  Well, I'm still waiting for them to get it right.  The inability to record video has been addressed with a change to Dropbox as the video service used.  Unfortunately, the software updates required to make that change has broken a bunch of other stuff.  I can't watch video from my iPhone anymore.  Calling up a camera just produces a still picture.  This is the case even on very fast wi-fi connections.  Occasionally the frame will refresh at intervals of once every 30 seconds to 2 minutes, but mostly you just see a freeze frame.  Audio still streams.  I could go through a laundry list of bugs, but it's easier to say that the only thing In.Sight's software does reliably is crash.  If Philips intends to fix these bugs, they're keeping it a secret.I'm disappointed to say that my belief that Philips would step up and turn the In.Sight into a reliable device may have been wrong.  Not recommended.UPDATE to the UPDATE:  I spoke a day too soon.  Philips just released an update that addresses a lot of the bugs.  The app is still clunky and frustratingly slow.  The picture quality is still awful.  But the system now works like it's supposed to, even if it's still buggy.  I originally gave the In.Sight 3 stars, then reduced it to 1 star.  Now, I'm giving it four stars.Update number 3:  Well it worked for a couple days.  Now it's quit completely.  The app told me today that there was a firmware update for the monitor.  I went though the update process and ended up with the same firmware revision I had before.  Still, the monitor worked for a few minutes, then quit.  I've reset the monitor and gone through the reinstallation process three times, deleted and reinstalled the iOS app once and generally spent way too much time trying to coax this thing into working.  I quit.  into the junk box it goes.", "Date": "July 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "It has gotten better, but it's not great", "Author": "T.J.", "ReviewID": "R1WC0H2D24A74Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a nice camera that I can access while away from the house.  I've been using it for a year now and am happy with it; it meets my need.  I have the device plugged into my iMac and run the app on my iPad and iPhone.Over the last year they have put out app updates that have improved it, so be sure you're reading the newer reviews.  The app makes or breaks this product, and for me, it's now a solid 3 stars.  It wasn't that way in the beginning, but I've stuck it out and it has gotten better.  The camera itself works good, and I guess if it's going to be pushing streaming video, the quality can't be that great or else you're not going to be getting good streaming.  Therefore, I can accept that the image isn't HD, or even close for that matter.  I simply love the way it can adjust where it's pointed (manually that is, remote adjustment is not possible).  It takes up a small footprint, which is nice and takes no time at all to setup.I'd like the ability to turn off the green \"on\" light so as to make it more covert for home security.  I guess you can put some tape on that, but it doesn't seem like you should have to do that.I like the alerts function which you can turn on and off for when something enters the view or for when it picks up a noise.  You can also set the threshold level for the audio alert.  When the alert is activated, the app tells you and gives you the option to start streaming video. Nice.There is a service plan that can go with this product, but I haven't exercised that.  You can turn it into a \"pro account\" at the cost of $24.99/yr.  That gives you the ability to have it be a baby monitor, share the monitor with up to 10 persons, keep 7 days of alert history, and display up to 100 recent alerts.  Do I need this service?  No, not really.  However, I'd like the \"baby monitor\" feature, but I'm not about to pay $25 a year for it!  It seems rather dishonest for them to offer a microphone on the product, but yet, you can't really utilize it unless you give them money.  That's not right.  If I want a baby monitor, I can just set this up for the video and use a real baby monitor for the audio.  Well, that's one solution anyway.Like I said, this meets my need but it's not perfect.  They're always going to require a cost to fully utilize this product, so I think that's going to be an issue for most folks, me included.  I just wish they'd offer a great product without requiring you to pay a yearly fee to use it.BTW, I feel that honest, effective reviews, can take the place of first-hand experiences that are lacking in online shopping. I've always appreciated the help I've received from other reviewers and work hard to return the favor as best as I can.

It's about the size of a lipstick case, or a Wiimote that was shortened by about two inches.  It's very unassuming looking and is easy to hide if need be.  There is a mini USB power input on the back, while the camera lens, microphone, and an indicator light (which can be disabled) are on the front.  Included with the Philips is a nicely designed magnet base that allows you to easily swivel and tilt the camera along with a wall / ceiling mounting bracket.  Also included is the wall electrical outlet USB adaptor that inserts flush with the back of the camera (the camera consumes 3 watts of electricity).  The camera is very nicely made and feels solid in the hand.Setting up and using the camera couldn't be easier.  You simply download the free app from the iTunes app store and the onscreen prompts will guide you through set-up.  You don't even have to enter your Wi-Fi network information, as the app creates a Q-code that you \"show\" the camera to transfer network information.  The Philips connected to my AirPort Extreme base station that uses WPA 2 security in a few seconds.The camera app itself is fairly simple and presents a list of the camera(s) you have on the network when you open it.  From there you can choose the camera to watch a live feed.  As long as light levels are moderate in the room (at least a 60 watt lamp) the picture will be bright and clear.  As light levels drop the picture becomes grainy and murky, and forget about shooting in low light or the dark, as this is not a night vision camera.  Additionally, you'll want to make sure you don't point the camera toward a part of the room with a strong light source, like an open window, as the interior of the room will become too dark to see properly.  Resolution is nothing special, and is similar to an early VGA phone camera, but you can make out objects easily.  Sounds quality is high and picks up everything from faint sounds to a dog barking.  The field of view is not very wide and cannot show the whole room at once.  Whether streaming over my local Wi-Fi network, a Wi-Fi network not at home, or AT&T;'s 3G network, the feed was smooth and hiccup free.  I used to camera to check up on my dogs and watch my slow cooker when I wasn't home.  The biggest letdown of the software is the fact that it sometimes quits randomly and is very slow in operation.  Choosing an option results in a delay of a couple of seconds.You can set-up alerts to be sent to your phone when there is movement and / or sound detected.  The app allows you to change the sensitivity level that will prompt an alert.  Additionally it is supposed to record a 30 second clip to YouTube once sound and/or movement is detected, but it's not functioning currently (see below).09/03/2012 Update:  As of now Philips has enabled web-viewing.  It's very basic, but it works.  YouTube recording is being cancelled and will be replaced with DropBox recording, but that is not live yet.09/24/2012 Update: Instead of YouTube, Philips worked out a partnership with Dropbox, and that's now where your clips and photos get recorded.  You simply have to set-up a free Dropbox account and then it will create a folder for the Philips where the video clips and images will be stored.  Overall, it works well, and I prefer storing the videos on Dropbox verses YouTube.All in all...a great camera with frustrating software.", "Date": "July 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Needs a little more flexibility", "Author": "A.

I like that I can turn off the indicator light on it and the camera still records.  Makes me feel \"stealth\" when recording without the light on. Anyway, I've upgraded the firmware easily through the app.  you must be on your same wifi connection though to do that.  It's been a bit of touch and go with the newly added DropBox functionality but finally it works and I'm liking the ease of that, too.  The only drawback is that it was not completely user friendly and while I was having trouble getting it connected on my iPhone, I finally downloaded the DropBox app to my phone and that seemed to make the connection work.  However it did take several attempts before it did work.  the live streaming works great.the not so good stuff:  I only deducted one star for the things that I don't like, but that's because they really have been pretty regular in improving the app. So I still have hope for them.  On to the review - the documentation and help files are really weak.  As mentioned above it took several attempts to get the DropBox working, but I finally did.  they really need better instructions.  Also, some WiFi networks won't let you access video.  Like when I'm at work and connected to the wifi there, they have the port closed for viewing video so I can't get logged in to this camera (or my other brand security cameras either).  I have to turn wifi off and then it works just fine.  If you're experiencing a problem connecting to your camera when away from your home, I suggest try turning off the wifi and trying it with just the mobile network.also, the app needs a good user-experience-designer to go through it.  it's not exactly the most user friendly, I had to click around in order to find the things.

Both cameras are the Phillips M100. I really like that these cameras are compact and hardly noticeable if you're not looking for them. You can hide them even further and turn the recording light off from within the Phone app. The power cable that they come with is, in my opinion, ridiculously long. The setup process, while tedious, is incredibly simple. You download the app, Select to connect a new camera (Make sure your phone is on the wifi network you want the camera attached to) and hold the camera at about 2ft from the phone so it can scan the QR code that's generated.The Video Quality is mediocre, but excellent considering the camera size. The Audio pickup is actually TOO strong. I say that because I live in an attached town house and I've accidentally recorded my neighbors talking (I had the camera up against the wall). The best feature is the ability to upload anything that the camera catches to Dropbox. I recommend not doing this if the camera is focused on a high traffic area (like the front door) as it will fill your Dropbox (I have a 70gb limit, and i was low on space in about a month).

But the recordings are sorely lacking. First, I get both a .jpg and an .mv4 every time motion/sound is detected. I really don't want the jpg's, but there is no way to turn them off. Then the .mv4's give me 10+ seconds before the action that triggered the recording (apparently captured in a buffer and included in the recording) but then only gives me 4 to 5 seconds of the activity ... shouldn't it be the other way around? A 3or 4 second buffer before the action, then 15 to 20 seconds of the triggering activity? Or couldn't that be a software setting?The Philips website is no help.

One in the nursery, one by the front door, etc. The plan was to make this mobile - move it where it was needed, when needed. Loved the idea that I could use it with my Android. Then it arrived. All the instructions are for iPad/iPhone. Nothing even mentioned the droid - but the complete manual that you can download online clearly states it supports the Android. Hmmmm.  Checked the Google app store - nothing. Searched the Philips site - nothing. Found the manual online - as I said, the manual states that this will work with an Android or idevice. Well, it will NOT work with a droid, so I can't test it there.So I borrowed an iPad. The setup went smoothly until it came time to \"complete monitor registration\" - the final step.  The \"this may take a couple minutes ...\" (yes, the grammar is that bad) screen has been up for three hours. So, it won't work with an iPad either. The interface is obviously written for the iPhone - itty bitty keyboard, small interface - have to zoom it on the iPad, so then it's all fuzzy.Tried a few times - the iPad can't complete the setup.  So no driod support, no iPad support - don't have an iPhone so can't test that. The product description states \"You can also view video using Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari, or Firefox on a PC or Mac\" - none of that is true. What's worse, after doing more research, the unit disconnects you after 5 minutes. You have to reconnect. That's the online service Philips provides to connect with the camera. You can reconnect as many times as you want, but you can't view for more than 5 minutes at a time. If you PAY for the premium service, this jumps to 20 minutes.  This is more of an alarm than a camera. It detects motion and sends a photo, then you can watch.

I have it set at the highest setting and it sometimes records and sometimes not, and only for a short time, doesn't capture the whole event.  Also, you have to pay a fee for multiple users to be able to use it, like my daughters and boyfriend.  You can only view live while on another wireless service for 5 minutes at a time and I have also never figured out how to record a week's worth or day's worth of video.  I bought the Dropcam HD and started using it today.  I would recommend it highly.  You can use it with your Android phone and also your iPad/iPhone.  For 9.99 a month or 99 a year it automatically records a week's worth of video to be able to review.  Just click the day you want to watch and/or the time of day and it is there.  Verynice feature.

The description and the instructions in the box both said one could view the video feed remotely on Android devices. There are printed instructions on how to obtain the app from Google Play/Market. The problem, there is no Android app for the M100. A quick web search revealed Philips had scrubbed all mention of Android from the current M100 web pages. The Google cache contains M100 pages from the Philips web site touting the Android app but only cached versions of those pages exist, Philips having removed them from the site. As my phone and tablet are Android machines, I am out of luck.My wife, however, has an Ipad 2. Obtaining and installing the required app was easy enough. Setting up the camera was straight forward (point the camera at the QC code and everything falls into place).So what is there to like about the M100? For starters, it delivers sound and video. One can configure the M100 to send sound or motion triggered alerts to the device on which the app is installed. Of course, one can't view the alerts as the YouTube upload functionality has been disabled. There is the promise of future, automatic uploads to Dropbox,  We shall see.The image quality is adequate. It is not HD so it does not scale up very nicely. However, the lower resolution probably allows for smoother playback over a wider range of devices. Which brings me to the web browser interface. It took many attempts over several days before I could actually see video through a web browser at my office (the camera is located at my home, surveilling my dog). When I finally did get it going (after updating Java and tweaking my firewall)I was less than impressed with the frame rate and video quality. Despite very fast DSL connections on both ends, playback was choppy, sound dropped out, and the image varied from pixelated to relatively smooth looking. Considering, however, Philips limits one's ability to view live video for more than about 5 minutes, remotely, there is little time to become too annoyed.If you are looking for a camera that allows you to periodically peak into a remote location, the M100 may fill the bill. If you are looking for even a basic security camera setup, it is definitely not the answer. There is a huge trade off between the relative ease of streaming live footage via Philips' (or its partner's servers) and configuring a router to stream video from a serious multi-camera, hard drive equipped surveillance system. The M100 and its promise of preserving short snippets of video by uploading to Dropbox are no substitute for a robust hard drive with the right software.One more thing, it appears the M100 is not really a product unique to Philips.
