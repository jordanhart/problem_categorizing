{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice little camera once you go through the manual set up!", "Author": "LisaLisa \"kldckldc\"", "ReviewID": "RJ4XEU0UNIN36", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE: 12/03/13.  Upgraded to FIVE STARS now.Although I noted that I'd provide an update in 30 days...it just hasn't been worth my time as I'd disconnected the IZON camera for a while.  This product was definitely hit-or-miss.  Three weeks ago, we got a new router for our home wireless system.  I finally found time over the weekend to try to set up the camera again.USE THE MANUAL SET-UP PROCESS.....When it WAS working previously in the summer, and we would check the camera when away from home, invariably we would get a black camera screen, or a frozen video screen with \"network congestion\" as a regular message.  I'm not sure what network congestion was there when no one was at home, so...that's one of the reasons I disconnected the camera.  No point in having it on if it's not providing a clear readable image.Since we got a new router, I thought that might resolve the problems, and it did.  We had a D-Link router and now we have an ASUS router.  Started to try to set up and connect via my iPhone.  The message was \"Number of Bonjour retries exceeded.\"  So I switched to my iPad for setup.  Went through the \"manual set up\" and that seems to have worked just fine.  The firmware updated so that was a bit of a delay to get up and running.  It's working now.The camera works great over wifi, too, which I tested today while shopping at The Home Depot over their public wireless system.  The sound is also working well.  This is great since we just adopted a dog and we want to keep tabs on him remotely even when we are outside in the yard or upstairs from his \"den.\"I now would definitely recommend this product to Apple product users.+++++++++Bought one of these cameras to use with my iPhone.  Wanted to use it at home for security purposes.Took forever to get it to set up with my home wireless network.  Like another reviewer, I went through the exact same process many times.  Finally on the 10th try, the camera was working.  Just seems that the process takes a lot longer than 10 minutes to set up, so be patient.Once I got the camera up and running through the regular setup process, it added another \"instance\" of what appeared to be the same camera on the iPhone app, which it then tried to register, and both were somehow deleted.  The \"register\" process seemed to hang a lot.  So, I started over.  Again.  And this time I went through the \"Manual Setup\" process -- three times before it actually worked.MANUAL SET UP WAS THE KEY!The help guide that's located on the IZON app isn't the same as the one on their website.  Also, the steps are not the same.  The online version is far more comprehensive.  I find that to be a huge issue with product companies.  (Do you really think customers will give your product a great rating if it takes hours of repetitive steps and Googling on the Internet to get it set up?)  The suggestion to disconnect your home wireless router was silly because the app will tell you that you need to have an active wireless connection to set up the camera.  If the app crashes, it will ask to send a report back to STEM.  Each time I got a response back from the STEM Help Desk, it was the exact same set of instructions which were not working.  Being the stubborn IT professional that I am...I was sure going to figure this out by myself!  And I did.Once I got the camera up and running, it did exactly what I needed.  I can view from my iPhone 5 and iPad while on my home wireless network, and can also view while on 4G or LTE service through AT&T.;I'm probably being very kind by giving 3 stars considering the time it took me to set up and the constant crashing of the iPhone app and \"network congestion\" errors (is that MY network or is it the Internet?).Although the IZON iPhone app crashes very often, the iPad app seems to be working better.  The camera appears to drop from my wireless network every now and then.BE AWARE that the camera has a microphone on it and picks up sound pretty clearly.  If you have the camera on constantly and are pointing it out a window to watch the wildlife outside, like I am, be aware that it is still picking up sound in the room whether you are wanting to monitor sound or not.  That's ok with me unless someone nearby could access it and listen in to the conversations inside our house.  Just a note of reminder to those of you not wanting to monitor sounds.I will provide an update within a month.  I can't recommend this product at this point.  So THREE STARS it is for now.", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Needs some work", "Author": "Happy Cooker", "ReviewID": "R2AO9UJCLELI9B", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this one after the three month old In-Sight by Phillips failed to send notifications to our iPhone 4S.  The Izon View was a bugger to install.  After spending about 5 or 6 hours on it, I finally got it working.  I installed the app on the iPad 3, too, and it would send notifications to it but not to the iPhone 4S so I deleted it from the iPad as it's not the one I carry around with us.After reading the reviews here, thought some of you might find this response from Stem Innovation helpful if you have trouble with the installation.\"Thank you for contacting Stem Innovation!We suggest installing your IZON manually by following the instructions below:1) First, unplug the IZON, wait 10 seconds, and plug the IZON back in.2) Reset your IZON or IZON VIEW by following the instructions below:a) Insert the tip of a paperclip into the pinhole on the BACK of the IZON until you feel a soft `click'. Hold in this position for 10-15 seconds until the LED light inthe front of the camera turns off for a few seconds. The light will then turn on and show a quick, alternating ORANGE and GREEN pattern. Please keep inmind that the alternating ORANGE and GREEN pattern could last for several seconds. *WARNING: DO NOT insert anything in the pinhole on the FRONT ofthe camera (this is the microphone port) as it may damage your IZON VIEW and void your warranty.b) The LED light will then turn solid ORANGE. This will complete the rebooting process. Please keep in mind that the light could stay solid ORANGE for a fewminutes. The LED light will then start blinking one of the following blinking patterns depending on the firmware version of the IZON or IZON VIEW:IZON 1.X: Blinking ORANGE and GREEN (in this case, you need to perform the manual setup and please update your firmware)IZON 2.0.2: Blinking ORANGE patternIZON VIEW 3.0.2: Blinking intermittent ORANGE ORANGE and GREEN GREENIf this is not successful on your first try, go through the above steps again. The LED patterns MUST follow this sequence in order to be reset properly.3) Return to the Stem app and click `Add Camera' under the `IZON Cameras' section. A new screen will appear. Choose the IZON or IZON VIEW depending on yourspecific camera.4) A new screen will appear saying: \"IZON will be installed on your network named: (your Wifi password)\". Click on the 3rd button called 'Manual Setup' (instead of the'continue' button).5) A Manual Setup message will appear saying, \"This process should be used if QR Code discovery is not successful, or if the camera blinking pattern is alternatingorange and green.\" Press `Continue'.6) Follow the instructions as prompted by the app to complete the Manual Setup:a) Switch to the stem network by going to the settings app on your iOS device. Under Wifi, connect to the STEM network. Return to the Stem app and click`Continue' in the top right corner.b) An image of the camera view should come up within several seconds. Click on the image.c) A new screen will show your Wifi network. Select your Wifi network. Enter and verify your Wifi password. Press 'Continue' in the top right hand corner of thescreen when finished. (When the password and verification match, then the 'Continue' button will turn green.) Please keep in mind that it may take severalseconds to save the password.d) Once the camera's blinking pattern changes to GREEN, you will be prompted to leave the Stem app, and return to your settings on your iOS device andswitch back to your own Wifi network.e) Return to the Stem app and press `Continue' in the top right corner. A picture of the camera view will appear and the camera will start the registering processby going through the following checklist (please note that this step could take up to 30 minutes):\u2714 Establish Connection With Camera\u2714 Gather Information From Camera\u2714 Establish Server Connections\u2714 Verify All Connections\u2714 Final Configuration\u2714 Final Registrationf) Once the camera has gone through the registration checklist, a `Success' message will appear. Press `OK'.Your camera is now ready for use! Tap on the image of the camera for `live streaming' mode and to start enjoying your IZON VIEW!Please let us know if you need any further assistance.\"_____If I had to do this all over again, I would only do the manual install - the other was a complete waste of time.  I wouldn't rely on this to watch over an elderly patient or monitor a baby's room - as I think it's a hit and miss product and a bit pricey to not be reliable.", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cloud space and motion detection", "Author": "Johw89joh", "ReviewID": "R3L9OQ6ZZW81J6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Over the last few days I've tried using and placing in different areas the Izon camera. The camera is an incredible idea in theory, unfortunately it doesn't work the way I would hope. Whenever Night Vision turns on in the evening, the camera starts to record 30 second clips every 2 minutes. These clips are supposed to record whenever the camera senses movement. (Also these clips begin recording every two minutes with the sensitivity meter turned all the way down.) Unfortunately there is a limit of 25 videos per day, and since they are recording faithfully every two minutes, it fills up after an hour or so. Afterwards it takes screenshots every two minutes until dawn. This defeats the purpose of getting an alert that there is movement when I'm away from my home.I bought the camera in preparation of a vacation to watch my pets, but due to its inability to detect motion successfully, my quota of videos are taken up within the first hour of the 24 hours in a day. What's the point of having it?Considering that this was a \"user error\" I changed where the camera detects motion, the motion sensitivity, and I've place the camera in three different locations- no success. When I called tech support I was told to unplug it and plug it back in, then after a long silence, I got no further advice apart from an \"I'm sorry\" when it didn't work. (Great customer service, I'd say!) The problem seems software related since I noticed the Night Vision seems to refresh every couple minutes as well. Just to be sure I wasn't crazy I checked my wireless connectivity and I'm streaming top notch.Another problem I've had is that though notifications are turned on in the app, and in my iPhone's settings, I can only see notifications when I open up the app and check them manually. I wish this would work the way I had hoped, but unless a type of update to fix the problem I'm having comes out, I'll have to return the 100.00+ Product, along with its' mediocre customer service.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "can't share videos", "Author": "BostonMerlin", "ReviewID": "R16FW5KY910YRB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "this camera takes fine videos but you can not share those videos with anyone.  they're locked into the app.  WTF!!!!!", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Super easy setup", "Author": "J.

However, I found the stability of performance of 2.0 is worse than 1.0We saw image on 1.0 but 2.0 show nothing... it completely stop working and reloading all the time..... so it is really frustrated if you need to monitor baby or elderly people. and Yes, if you set up motion sensor for recording, sometimes it give alert without image or recording...so what is the use?", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Did not work on my iPhone as expected", "Author": "Dan", "ReviewID": "R2RBI41QEFDJS6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Did not work on my iPhone as expected.

I used to have a Linksys WVC80N home monitoring camera that was a huge pain. You practically needed to be a sysadmin to figure out how to connect it to your home network.

While it had a similar quality picture, the Foscam has a terrible manual and worse, it just goes away with no explanation.Pros:1) Small2) Simple3) Reliable4) Easy to configure (but slow)Cons:1) no pan / tilt option2) no browser interface for your computer3) limited settings for motion alarm mode4) Slow configuration processRating:  I'm pleased enough to buy several moreUPDATE:October 2013 (5 months later)I'm still very pleased with these cameras.  I bought more.They continue to operate with no further intervention.I can turn the SOUND or MOTION detection on or off from my iPhone anytime.They give me great sense of peace, knowing everything is OK at home when I'm away.I don't own the WiFi Router in my house - it's a cable company box.I was looking for some kind of camera that did not require me to open ports or do any kind of network configuration and this is the right camera for that reason.It is simple, reliable, and easy to move around to anywhere in the house.The app has updated since I bought it, and while it required me to log in again, that was the only glitch.  The new app interface is better in many ways, but the server gets tied up at times.  So, I have learned to just check back a little later and usually, it's able to download the images to my phone.It's not perfect and the only reason they get 4 stars instead of 5 is the app, not the actual camera!I'm buying more and sending them to everyone in my family who has an iPhone.Cheers !!!Jan 2014 report (7 months later)Make sure you have updated your STEM app.Just before vacation, my iPhone alerted me to check my cameras.  They had a new image, but I could not download it.  Then I noticed my cameras were offline and a text message was on top of the video window.  It turns out that my WiFi router was broken.  The internet, TV and phones still worked, but the wireless was coming up and going away every other minute!  (If the cameras dropped off the wireless network, there is no way then can send a video clip.  There may be an alert, but don't expect any video to download)I replaced the router and then I added each existing camera again.  During that process, the STEM APP ask for the WiFi network password (it changes when you get a new router).  After that, two information screens came up, I clicked OK each time and then a QR image (the large square with a random pattern of black and white boxes) appeared.  It is the WiFi network password in a digital format that the camera can read.  There are 3 steps listed at the bottom,  so read them and be prepared to wait a few minutes.  This login and configuration process is very slow, but it does work!1) Each camera reads the QR code.  It blinks green (twice) and orange (twice) connecting to the WiFi (logon/password)Durring this process, made sure the code is visible and that a message hasn't covered it up.  You may have to click OK a couple times.2) Finally, the camera will change to a solid orange color.  (connected to the internet)3) The app instructions tell you not to do anything until the IZON camera led turns green.  Well, it won't unless you allow the STEM app to complete the registration process, which takes about 5-10 minutes!!!  You will probably have to say OK to a couple of notices and then a menu comes with a checklist of what it's doing.  Just wait.  It's very slow, but it will work !!!The lesson here was that the app alerted me that the cameras had each been triggered, and while they said the network was down, I couldn't figure that out, since my cell phone was still work (albeit on the cell network, not my home network).  Your router can be working and making internet connections, while the wireless part is down.  I didn't expect that.I figured out that the new app will not allow you to Delete an existing camera.  But,  you can add a camera and it will replace the one you had before (not much different than adding a printer to a computer).NOTE: Wireless devices can get pretty warm when they can't connect to their router.  It might even over-heat.  So, consider unplugging the camera and letting it cool down, if it has been off-line a long time.  The STEM app instructions are correct and they do work.", "Date": "May 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009H5EZE6"}}
