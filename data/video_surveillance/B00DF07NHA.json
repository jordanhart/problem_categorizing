{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A good camera but it has its limits", "Author": "Blake McJunkin", "ReviewID": "RN7JM0HJ9U6JK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera provides a nice sharp vibrant image when moderate light is available.  Its low light spec is 0.5lux so it does poor in an area without enough lighting.  You will see noise in the shadow areas that are not lit.  It lacks WDR so when the lighting is not flat or even, there will be loss of detail.  In lots of instances with light behind a person their face will be dark and featureless.This camera has most all of the settings you find on other ACTI cameras such as 3 region motion detection with adjustable sensitivity and threshold.  It also has an incredibly flexible event setup that you can send emails with images or ftp video.  The camera has a whole list of URL commands so every parameter can be changed with a URL command instead of the web interface.So in the right location this camera gives good video, but there is a new generation of ACTI cameras out now that are much better for not much more money.  You have to make the call if you save enough on this camera to make it worth it.  I am thrilled with all the settings this camera offers, but the video performance at times could be better.", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DF07NHA"}}
