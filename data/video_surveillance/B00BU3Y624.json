First of all, the boxes containing all the equipment were sealed as tight as Fort Knox and it took forever to open them. I wish now I would have simply ripped the boxes open. Installation of the cameras is not difficult. We ran the wires through our attic and the cameras were easily mounted onto the soffitt. Note: these cameras must be mounted from the top and not the side or the image will be turned. Setting the DVR up locally was a piece of cake. You plug in all the wires to the back of the DVR, turn it on, and the cameras are up and running. The images are clear, the cameras record fine, even at night. Bugs flying in front of the cameras will start the recording process. We are still fine tuning the settings to block out moving tree limbs and shrubs. You can set the sensitivity of each camera as well as adjust the color.Our first problem was trying to hook the DVR up to our HD TV. Our TV has no VGA outlet, so we purchased a HDMI converter, which added to the cost. One of the features of this system is remote access to view your cameras from the internet -- anywhere in the world they say -- or on your smartphone. After several calls to Tech Support (and holding for over 30 minutes each time), we could not get the system to work remotely. We learned a few things. The system uses Port 80. Check with your ISP because most of them block Port 80 (some may unblock it for a monthly fee). There is a working way around this on another port, but you must use a PC computer for this. They don't tell you this on their website nor is it in the manual. (The system will work fine on a Mac locally but it must use Port 80 for remote access.)After 90 minutes with Tech Support on the last call, they were unable to get the email set up to work. You hate it when a tech person says, \"I don't know why this isn't working.\" He had taken control of the computer and DVR and was setting this up. Basically, we've spent approximately 6 hours on the phone between Night Owl, our ISP and the manufacturer of our router (each blaming the other) trying to get this system to work properly -- and it's still not working the way this system should.I will give kudos to their Pro app because the setup works flawlessly on our smartphones. You can snap pictures from the cameras, save the video, manage your DVR from your phone. You will need to make sure you're using a wi-fi connection since the data runs constantly.The manual that comes with this system is very basic. There is a lot of missing information that you find out only after you've had to call them. If you've got the IT skills, you're still going to encounter problems. And the cameras have to be already installed in order to set everything else up, so it's too late to pull the wires back out, unmount the cameras, box it all up, and ship it back.We're still ironing out the bugs and hope to eventually get things set up to where all the features work the way they should. Night Owl's tech support is 24/7 and unlimited, so we're not giving up just yet.", "Date": "September 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "needs better color balance", "Author": "Tod", "ReviewID": "R3K67IYLZ64QC5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Needs Better color adjustment and better online setup. 24/7 Support was not every supportive when called, left waiting to long", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "8 Channel smart DVR with pre-installed 500GB hard drive\nFree Night Owl Pro software and CMS software for your PC or Mac\nMotion activated push notifications and or email alerts\nView, playback and configure your system anywhere in the World from your Smartphone or Tablet\n8 x Indoor/Outdoor cameras with 50FT night vision", "Name": "Night Owl Security ADV1-88500 8-Channel Security System with 500GB HD with 8 Indoor/Outdoor Cameras and  Pro App (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LPn--%2BUiL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BU3Y624"}}
