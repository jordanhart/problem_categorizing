It doesn't.  Was finally able to generate an image, and thought it was going to work, but immediately malfunctioned as soon as I attempted it's alleged wifi capability.  Web interface is from some random Asian company, prompts are all in poorly translated English.  Impossible to set up, requires a 150 page manual which must be downloaded as a PDF.  Manual contained no troubleshooting tips at all, assumes everything will work - far from it.  At least it allowed on board storage (if you buy an SD card for it) but I never got to that point.  May work with older operating systems, but wasn't worth the hassle.  Customer service from seller was great (Mafia Buys) they were the best part of the transaction and gave me a complete refund after two weeks of frustration caused by the product.  SHOP AROUND - look for a product called Dropcam Pro.  I got one of these instead, and had it up and running in 60 seconds.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$149.99", "Features": "I Camera\nDo-it-yourself (diy) Easy Setup\nAdvanced H.264 Video Compression\nRemote Monitoring Over The Internet From A Pc(ie) Or Mac (safari)\nP2p Service For Easy Remote Access Without Networking Knowledge Or Configuration\nIp Camera", "Name": "Securityman IPCAM-SD DIY Wireless/Wired IP Camera with H.264, SD Recorder, Night Vision, PTZ, & 2-Way Audio - White", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oCDnAKfUL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BDC77Q4"}}
