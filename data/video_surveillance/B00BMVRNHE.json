I was able to paint the enclosure to match my house (hoa).  Protects the camera well.  (Not air tight).  Biggest concern where I live is direct sunlight and this does the job.  Very easy to mount (make sure you buy stucco screws from Home Depot if you are mounting to stucco, don't use the screws included as they are meant for dry wall.  You MUST have an external light source for night time.  Read the description, the ir lights WILL reflect.  Unit did come with the power cord extension and a small cat 5 cable.  I would recommend using clear silicon around the units arm and your home if you are mounting outside.", "Date": "June 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good solution if you want to use your indoor Foscam camera as an outdoor one", "Author": "Andrew", "ReviewID": "R2DHGSF6EW7BL9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Although I cannot recommend Foscam cameras due to manufacturing defects that has yet to be addressed, this enclosure is well worth the money if you want to use your indoor Foscam camera, such as the FI8910W, as an outdoor one.  The enclosure is rather large so careful planning needs to be made to make sure the enclosure fits and the view of the camera is sufficient for monitoring the area you wish to keep an eye on.  Besides silicone, it comes with everything you need to mount the enclosure including mounting screws, power extension cable for your Foscam camera and even cloth gloves to keep the dome portion smudge free!  Normally with an outdoor Foscam unit (and plan on having it wired instead of wireless), you will need to drill a significant hole (1 3/8\") in order to route the camera connections into your home.  Since the network connection (RJ45 jack) is connected on the unit itself for indoor Foscam cameras, the hole needed is much smaller (1\" or less) since you will only need the network and power cable for connections.  Overall I was satisfied with the fit and finish of this enclosure.Although the enclosure is of great quality, I had to take away one star because the IR lights reflect of the dome when they are turned on which essentially makes it useless for night vision.  This can be remedied with adding IR illuminators and turning the IR lights off on the camera.", "Date": "November 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Does the Job", "Author": "R.

Well made and is sturdy.  It includes a hex wrench, a pair of white cotton knit glove, among other items.  Mounting was simple, but remember a drill is needed to drill a small hole (about 1/2\") from inside wall to outside wall/siding to run the supplied power cord from electric outlet to the mounted camera.  Excellent product, but is expensive.  Highly recommended if you bought an indoor camera and want to use it outside.  However, as with some other reviewers' comments, once you decide to use it outdoor, the IR feature that allows you to view without light at night becomes useless.  This is because the IR light will reflect light on the clear plastic dome enclosure back to the camera, not allowing a clear view of the surrounding.  I use the camera with the IR setting set to OFF.  If surveillance viewing at night is desired, you should have the outdoor lights on.", "Date": "May 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Little large, but...", "Author": "JvK, Canton GA", "ReviewID": "R2P0TWHQYM4ZGB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Fits the Foscam IP cameras well, even the FI9826WB.

The packaging was excellent, and the instructions were in perfectly clear English (this was the biggest surprise to me). It even came with white gloves to wear while handling the clear plastic enclosure to ensure no finger prints were left behind. I'd absolutely recommend this to anyone wanting to put an indoor camera outside. I can't say much for the weatherproof capabilities, as I have it under an overhang that protects it from the sun, wind, and rain. It's an attractive unit that fits the Foscam FI8910W perfectly. Keep in mind that the infrared lights won't work in the dome, as the light just gets reflected back to the camera. So you must have external illumination (like, for example, from a motion-sensor light or a floodlight) to get a decent image at night. That's not a fault of the dome; it's just simple physics.", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works with my INSTEON camera", "Author": "Lenny Scolaro", "ReviewID": "R8FIRA4HA3WQG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This dome works fine with my INSTEON indoor pan/tilt camera.  I was afraid that because the INSTEON camera is bigger than the Foscam that it wouldn't fit, but it fit just fine.  The construction is good, and the design well thought out.  My only gripe is that the dome reflects back the IR from the camera, but I knew that going in.  I could not find any dome enclosures that would fit my camer that didn't have that same shortcoming.  This would get 5 stars if they made the dome out of a material that would not reflect the IR.

It might be different if the IR lights had a setting so that they didn't automatically cut on, but they do.  So in order to use these darn things, you will have find an external IR light that has the proper frequency, order and install it (don't forget a power cord if it doesn't come with one) and them manually cut off the camera's IR every night.
