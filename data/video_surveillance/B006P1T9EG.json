{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Concept Poorly Executed", "Author": "J.C.", "ReviewID": "RPM3NYSUH2PVV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The camera is of solid construction and mounts clean - no exposed wiring. The picture quality is good at night and in color because of the white LED's that illuminate the area. It is a 100% better than a typical IR camera in black and white where it can be hard to make out faces. With this camera you can see so much more in the dark. The wide angle lens allows the camera to cover about double the area of a standard camera. The only problem is the camera/lights cannot be adjusted to reduce the sensitivity of the motion detector. The unit false triggers about 60 times per day/night and causes my DVR to record footage of nothing over and over. Lorex says to try a different location for the camera, but this can be a pain if your cable has already been run. I did try relocating the camera, but got the same false motion detection results.If you do decide to get the camera, test it in the location first before you permanently run wires and mount the camera. It will also work well if you just want a good picture at night and don't need to record the image from this camera.If it didn't constantly false detect motion, I would give it 5 stars.", "Date": "February 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "It didn't work", "Author": "k7wwa", "ReviewID": "R3PQWUFRZNYMWQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The IR LED's worked at night so the cable was good but no video at any time.
