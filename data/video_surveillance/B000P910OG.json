I have another CCTV camera that is not affected however has a much thicker shielded cable jacket.  The cable does work for what it is intended, however beware of interference.  The only time however is at night time when the IR is active. I get some lines of red/blue when the transmitter is active.

Attempted to save $25 bucks by purchasing these cables through Amazon.  Perhaps for home use it might work. For commercial application the cables pick up too much noise and static compared to the cables I normally purchase.  This cable will not work well with the high quality cameras I installed.  This cable has both the video and power in just one cable compared to the one I normally use which has two cables side by side, one for video and one for power.  This cable is 1/3 the thickness of my other cables making it very fragile especially for long runs.  Had to replace them with the cables I normally purchased.  At least I was able to successfully use them to pull the good cable in to replace it so my efforts in pulling this cable above a dropped ceiling infested with itchy fiberglass was minimized.
