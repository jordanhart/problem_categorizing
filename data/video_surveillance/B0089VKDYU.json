Lesson learned ~ not all cameras are created equal. Seems there are many versions of these cameras with varying degree of quality. The one I received seems to be version #3. The date stamp that comes with the camera is \"01/01/2008\". The most current version seems to be version #16. Knowing what I know today, I would never buy a 808 Car Key Camera without knowing and being able to verify the version #. Want to know more about the different camera types, visit Chuck Lohr or check youtube \"808#16\". Editing the TAG file in the root will update the date and time. Translation to English was fairly bad but after watching a youtube video, I figured it out. The quality on my camera is ok, as a toy.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great mini camera for model rockets.", "Author": "j lin", "ReviewID": "R22ODRC9T6FPA5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great product for the price, I currently own 2 GO Pro 3 Black addition that have amazing features but are just to heavy for model rockets. I needed something that was light, easy to use, and disposable. After seeing the reviews I decided to go ahead and purchase, again I needed something light and disposable just in case it destroyed or lost and this item was my solution. The video quality is good, the sound quality is even more impressive I was able to record audio in a large open area and not loose a sound or word, but it is no GO Pro 3. I do recommend this product but again if you want high definition video with cool features you will need to buy something else, as that old saying goes \"You get what you pay for\".", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "parts missing", "Author": "mike brown", "ReviewID": "R25BQ7COHSOOXK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The title clearly said it came with a 8GB Mirco SD Card& Retail Box i did NOT GET the sd card with it.i paid a higher price for this thinking i would get what i ordered , there is a lot more that cost less on Amazon with out the card i should have ordered one of them.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "disappointed", "Author": "stephen scott", "ReviewID": "R1R8V4VHPG63OU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I lost the disk the first day it sticks oout the side and everything got caught on it, therefore I don't know if it worked or guality.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not as Advertised!", "Author": "Ricky A.

It came apart into pieces in my pocket just from the torque of my key ring. There are two super tiny screws holding the two halves of this item together. That's it. Also when it fell apart I noticed that there was a huge battery inside that really was just crammed in there held by no brackets or anything. Just loose. Due to the tiny screw being stripped out of the inferior plastic, it was impossible for me to fix. I just threw it away rather than try to save this item.", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Defective", "Author": "Winemaker9 \"Winemaker9\"", "ReviewID": "R1J3G6XA8ZMR6I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "opened box, missing card that was supposed to come with it.
