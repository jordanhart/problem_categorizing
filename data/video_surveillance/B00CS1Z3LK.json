{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Exactly as described and exactly what I needed", "Author": "Blade", "ReviewID": "R2V7NCFFCLX60A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The biggest data spec missing from everywhere you look is regarding the D1 recording. This DVR can record D1 on *all* channels at 7 frames per second. Dont buy into the \"real time\" stuff - nothing security wise is going to happen that you will need 30fps for unless you are watching card games. Your NOT trying to win Cannes. :) Independently adjusatable bit rate, quality, and recording resolution - so if you want some channels D1 at 30FPS you can do it. Each frame pulls from an avalable number - and you can spread the total frame rate out however you like. Hard drive installation is easy. I feel this DVR has every feature you could want at home, and would work equally well in the vast majority of business. Hope this helps - dont worry, I would absolutely buy this again. I made this purchase after weeks of trying to determine the best DVR to replace my aging AVTECH 787. I have no regrets, this thing seems rock solid with no noticable issues at all. Im currently running most of the channels and have several PTZ cameras connected...Again, no regrets, and if you buy it I dont think you will have any regrets either!", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$216.01", "Features": "New - Retail\n1-Year Warranty\nAposonic A-S1604R25E\nAposonic A-S1604R25E H.264 16-Channel CCTV Surveillance Standalone DVR 4-Audio / HDMI Output Mac Ready", "Name": "Aposonic A-S1604R25E H.264 16-Channel CCTV Surveillance Standalone DVR 4-Audio / HDMI Output Mac Ready", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31KheQ%2B6Y9L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CS1Z3LK"}}
