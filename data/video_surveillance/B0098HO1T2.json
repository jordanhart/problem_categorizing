{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great price,good system!", "Author": "Erik Langdon", "ReviewID": "R2OA3OO5WF90DR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I read reviews for several security camera systems before deciding on this one. There were no reviews on this particular one,but I had looked into the Zmodo systems,and this one had everything that I wanted at a good price,plus the prime shipping,so I took a chance on this one. Overall I am very pleased,even though the cameras are not actually Sony brand.From what I understand,they are Zmodo cameras with a Sony chip in them,but they work fine,and that is all that matters to me.I have read many negative reviews about most all of the camera systems,including the big name brands,but I really think that most of that is due to people having unrealistic expectations.They are security cameras people,your not going to get a stunning HD experience. I'm sure there are cameras out there that have a clearer picture than these,but they are going to cost alot more! Considering that you are getting eight cameras and a 1 terabyte DVR,you really can't beat these for the price. The picture you get during the day is actually quite good,the night vision is a bit dark if there are no lights around,but it does the job. The only real gripe I have is that the wires that go to the cameras are easily tangled,and that makes for some aggravation when running them,but even that isn't a real big deal. All in all,it's a great system for people like me who want security,without breaking the bank.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "so so system but cheap", "Author": "cinemalighting", "ReviewID": "R2EBYK3I528CEO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It was a good system for the price.  The camera's were just ok quality.  The connections on the back of the DVR were bad.  If i shuck them it would make the video shut off.  The fan was very very loud.  There is no way you could have this in a bed room or living room.  I returned mine with no problem.  I'm hopping that is was bad unit.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value good daylight video mediocre night performance", "Author": "John Johnson \"Tech Lover\"", "ReviewID": "R2SHC1XW5M38HY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to install and set up. Daylight video quality is very good. The nighttime quality is poor in areas without significant ambient light. On my well lit porches it works very well. In dark areas the IR illuminators faintly lights only the center of the image for less than 10 feet. But since it is 16 channel I can buy better cameras over time and move the included cameras to well lit areas. I don't think you will do any better without spending far more.", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$379.99", "Features": "1TB HDD Installed: 24/7 Record 16 Days\nSupport up to 16 cameras\nRemote Access via Smartphone or PC\nEmail Alert when motion detected\nMotion detected, time shcheduled & continuous recording mode", "Name": "Zmodo 16CH Real-time Security DVR System with 1TB HDD & 8 Sony CCD Outdoor Surveillance Cameras", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SDUnax0-L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0098HO1T2"}}
