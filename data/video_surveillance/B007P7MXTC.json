Bernard \"Dogsrule\"", "ReviewID": "R12522R3A2P1LF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not being a tech girl, I opted to find a wireless security system to allow viewing of outside my home. I didn't want to pay monthly charges for someone to do what I could do. This fits the bill. Plug it in to a power adapter and your set. Mount the camera where you want it, inside or out. I have had mine a little over 2 weeks, and you have the option to record motion only,certain times of day only or opt to record constantly. It does a great job, particularly during the day time. Night time, maybe if I had it installed outdoors it would pick up further, but for now, it is on my patio and picks up about 25-30 ft at night, I think it is due to the infrared reflecting off the screened patio. Daytime is pretty awesome. Can you tell what color someones eyes are, no. But you get the general description of the person or car, and the closer they get the better. I have had no issues like others complaining about the monitor having to be right next to the camera or missed recording. I have moved mine throughout the house and it works fine. Stucco walls. Read some reviews at Best Buy and they have mostly good things to say about it, like picking up from a barn. I picked mine up from HD just in case there was an issue I can look someone in the face or return it if need be. I did opt for a 16gb which I purchased and it records for about 3 days continuous and you can mark it to overwrite day after day as it fills up. I generally go in and view the files on my lap top, erase what I don't need and have 3-4 days of files. I got mine due to recent burglaries in the area, and without some kind of description around here, your case goes to the trash bin. You get a cd/cable to use with SKYPE to monitor from you phone or office computer. I am very pleased with it and will be purchasing a additional camera soon. You do have to place this near a receptacle, hence why mine is indoors on the patio. About 6 ft comes with it, or you can special order a 15ft. No interference from my cordless phone about a foot away. No interference from by cable modem or internet. I constantly get 5 bars for signal strength. With the 2 gb that comes with it, you can record about 4 hrs straight and then it is full or you can set to overwrite and it will keep going. I use the 2gb as a temp while reviewing the files on my 16 gb. You can speak to people via the camera without opening your door to strangers. Just press a button on back of monitor and ask what they want, release for them to speak and then push to talk back. I turned the beeps off that alert for motion detected, but you can leave it to attract your attention. Monitor comes with wall mount or as a picture stand. It has built in photos, 5 of them, that you can set to make it look like a picture frame instead of viewing whats recorded. For the price, you get quite a bang for your buck. At least I think so. Also the price listed on Amazon is one of the best I have seen so far for this unit.", "Date": "October 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Product & Customer Service are Terrible", "Author": "-pi- \"Patricia Ann Ingram\"", "ReviewID": "R1V8G977LD6X0X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this Security Camera system 07/21/12. I received the package 07/24/12. I had no problem setting it up as instructions indicated. I liked the Monitor because I could keep an eye on everything out my front door all the way to the street, including my car and front steps and still watch TV. On 07/25/12 I pulled the SD card and watched all the videos that I set up under Motion Detection, but realized it had recorded me putting cat food out at 6:44 am, and an automobile driving by at 7:07 am; however, it did not record me walking down my steps, getting into my car and backing out of my driveway around 7:00 am. As someone had broken the locking gas cap off my car recently I need this camera to pick up anyone walking up to it or approaching my front steps. I called customer service that day (25th) and was 14th in line @ 1:14 pm. 9th in line @ 1:18 pm, 6th in line at 1:22 pm and 3rd in line @ 1:25 pm then a man came on and wanted my phone number and they would call me back. I told the man I wanted to hold because I did not believe they would call me back; he said he had no way of putting me back in the Que so I gave him my name and phone number. At 9:14 pm CST (I was going to bed) I received a return call. After explaining what was wrong the man said he would replace the camera but he would need to send me an email telling me all the information they would need and I would have to send them a copy of my sales receipt. I told him that was no problem. I did not receive an email from him. I called them back the morning of the 26th, left my number for a return call and was called back in approximately 2 hours. I once again explained what was happening with the camera not recording properly and that I had not gotten the email. I received the email while this new man was on the phone. As of today I still have not heard back from the email I sent them on the 26th which means I will have to call them again and wait again for them to call me back and explain everything all over again. I guess I'm expecting too much to be able to call a company and get service or for a product to work as advertised.

The day and night view and very accurate. My camera records when motion is detected from approximately 20 feet, but does not include minor things (such as a bird flying or mosquitoes). Installation was about thirty minutes because I had to drill through concrete to get the camera's cord through my wall to plug in, but other than that it was very easy. The wireless feature is superb because I did not have to run wires through my attic or drill more holes in my house (something big to consider). Overall, I would highly recommend this and have already added a second camera.

It is easy to install, and very easy to set up. However, since I installed it my Wifi on my office computer does not work. I have had to hard wire (cat5) my PC to make it work. The interference is very bad. It cuts out the WiFi on a constant basis. If you have WiFi in your house, you need to be really careful where you locate the camera. Other PC's and tablets in the house are picking up Wifi ok, but their coverage range has been reduced. Lastly, the SKYPE for remote viewing is not easy to install.

I am happy with the system and would buy it again.  The camera can be hung from the ceiling which was a mandatory requirement for me.  The wireless camera of the competing system (Defender) did not appear to be capable of being hung from the ceiling.  The only minor negative issue I\u2019ve found with the Lorex system is the volume cannot be changed when the motion detector has turned on the recording to the SD card.  The volume control can be changed at other times but not during a motion detection recording.  So if the volume is turned all the way down to silent (very unusual situation) and the motion detector turns on the recording (person is at the front door) then you (LED monitor location) cannot hear the person speaking at the front door (camera location) and you cannot change the volume to hear the person speaking.  You are forced (in this rare circumstance) to open the front door to hear the person speak to you.  One other issue that is really a tip, the microphone of the camera will not work (at all) if the protective film that covers the camera lens during shipping is not removed.  I tested the system before hanging it and thought the microphone in the camera was broken.  I finally took the protective film off and the audio system worked great.

Although there is very little traffic on the road, my wife and I feel safer when we're able to see what's happening outside when the dogs start barking. I decided on the Lorex system after reading the reviews for various monitoring systems. I wanted the recording capability to capture any road traffic. I positioned the two cameras at the edge of the front yard, expecting to be close enough to the road for the motion sensors to pick up motion caused ny traffic, while at the same time being close enough within range so the wireless signal can reach the monitor inside the house. The cameras must be just on the edge of their motion-sensing capability because sometime they capture the traffic and sometimes they don't.

The cameras and receiver work together just fine.  I have worried a little because I was installing them on the outside of construction trailers and was worried about transmission through the metal sides of the trailers.  Three of the cameras came up just fine.The receiver could not see the fourth camera on the far side of the one of the trailers.  However, I was able to solve that problem by getting a 6-meter RP-SMA Extension Cable (typically used to relocated the antenna for wi-fi router)--cheap fix.  Using this cable, I was able to remove the antenna from the fourth camera and drag the cable (and antenna) nearer to the receiver's location.  Once the antenna was relocated, the camera came up with no problem.  I suspect that I could done the same thing with the antenna from the receiver for even moreflexibility/range.  If range is an issue, I would suspect that a \"powered/high gain antenna from the wi-fi world\" might help.My biggest complaint about the system is the documentation.  The documentation did not suggest moving the antenna to help solve transmission problem.  Of course, it did not provide information to help purchase the right cable, etc.  It would really nice if the manufacturer would work to determine if high-gain antenna, etc would help users.The other disappointment has been with the using the output of the system on an external monitor.  The system has a port for an external monitor and the company even provides a short cable (too short).  An extension RCA cables is a quick trip to Radio Shack.  It is even more annoying to have hunt down the note that using the external monitor disables the built-in monitor in buried in the trouble shooting section of the manual (as is the note about a five second delay in transferring to the external monitor, etc).  In order to have to two monitor locations, you will need two external monitors.  I haven't yet set up the two monitor, I worry that I have may to get a video splitter and amplifier to drive two monitors.  Again, the manufacturer could do a little testing provide guidance to customers.The remote control just barely works.

I mounted one camera right over the front door and one under the eve overlooking the driveway.  The idea was to give us a view of who is coming up the sidewalk, record package delivery etc.  For some reason Amazon pairs this unit with a 32 GB San Disk SD card ( you know the section that says people who bought this also bought this) and you can purchase both items with one click.  Not sure why they paired this with a 32 GB as the unit will only support a 16GB so I had to go buy 16 GB.  Other than that the system is pure plug and play, literally!  You just mount the cameras turn on the monitor and it works right out of the box. You do need a 110 volt outlet within 8 feet of the camera as each camera has to be plugged in.  Pretty simple instructions allow you to customize the view and other options for your specific needs.  The audio feature is great.  It is loud and clear and in the motion sensor mode you actually hear the people walking up before you see them.The manufacturer claims that the camera to monitor range is 450 feet with a direct line of sight and 150 feet through walls.  It\u2019s more like 50 feet when you mount the camera outside and view it in the house.  We were not able to place the monitor where we wanted to as the signal would fluctuate and lose the picture.All in all for the money and ease of installation it does the job.

It does this with both cameras. My nearest one is only 16 feet away with a glass barrier so there is nothing blocking the antennas, it's just a cheap monitor. The picture quality is NOTHING like what the manufacturer has advertised here. My deciding factor in purchasing this set was because it came with a monitor so it would have been nice to have a nicer quality one for the price I paid.My second complaint is that the housing around the cameras is plastic. Really? Plastic?! This won't last more than 2 years max of outdoor weather (summer heat & winter cold).  Not to mention one hard hit with a rock by a kid or criminal and it will be toast.Finally, the skype feature, while a good idea, is difficult to get set up. You can't watch the monitor if you're in skype mode and you can't skype if you're in monitor mode and you can't access the recording features if you are at another location skyping. Also, there are several other \"you can't do this feature while your doing that\" surprises... such as If you are in quad mode you can't record anything.... which makes no sense at all.I will do a review update in a few more weeks after I've worked out some of the bugs or in this case, found more of the bugs.

We use them in a house so I don't know what the max range is. We have no reception issues, period.Now For the bad news !!!If you are going to use a remote view there are issues. The monitor has 2 outputs. 1 is a Combo TV/Video output. The other is a USB computer output. When using either the Lorex monitor does not work. It's not supposed to. I wish it did. Also, using the USB port only access' Camera #1. If you use Skype to Monitor online (Yes that works fine) You are stuck with only Camera #1 or you must install/configure a video card. With the video output you can use the 4 camera feature. You can do this with Skype but it may take a bit of tinkering, depending on your system. I used a couple of refurbished Dell desktops and a PCI video card (all purchased thru Amazon) be sure you have lots of RAM on your computer (Wouldn't hurt to upgrade that while you're doing all this stuff, never can have too much memory). The video quality suffers some via the video card.  The system works and I am able to check on an elderly parent who lives alone several times a day. Gives great piece of mind to the family. (They can all visit with her via video anytime they want from across the USA). If Lorex would do a firmware update to make this thing work 4 camera/USB, It would be a fantastic system.

I was fortunate that the initial installation of the porch light was controlled by a switch inside the house, of course, right next to the door leading outside.  I checked that line and fortunately it was \"an end of line switch,\" which means that the wall switch controlled just the outside porch light and nothing else.  I was able to take the outside porch light completely out and that left just the normal 3 wires - black white and green to which I attached an ordinary house double socket wall receptical.  Everything worked fine.  The outside of our house was structured so the top of the entrance way was shielded from the weather.  You may have to do your's  through the attic but that should not be a problem.  It's very easy to lead the plug-in wires from the camera and/or another outside light through small holes and close them up.2 hints that caused us slight delay:  at one point I put up 2 cameras to get more direction - that was a mistake - cameras need to be a minimum seperation of 15 feet.  The second minor problem was the voice did not work properly until we removed the film on the camera lens.  Both of these were pilot errors and had nothing to do with the quality of the product.

As stated before, it might work fine if you had a big open room and could use your monitor in that room, but as far as for going from one room w/camera about 40' from the monitor and the signal having to pass through a sheetrock wall (even in-line) ... ummm... spotty at best. Outside was definitely a no go.  My friend has a Uniden and lives in a brick house.  Her camera's are outside and she can use her monitor anywhere in the house and gets a constant picture. However, she has only 2 cams on her system, she's in a diff. location, and maybe there are other factors that make a difference...?  I'm thinking probably the best way to go may be a hardwired system.  p.s.  when they say \"wireless\" they really mean... less wire.  All cameras and the monitor must be plugged in to a wall outlet.

It appears to be affected by walls, however, so the distance gets shortened...in my case by about half.2) I didn't have any WiFi interference, which I read about in reviews on the Lorex website.3) Has Quad-View, so four cameras visible on monitor at the same time.4) Sensors are sensitive and work well even at night.Neutral:1) Beeps every time the sensor senses motion. Volume can go low, but not completely off. So you probably don't want this in your sleeping area. It detects even cats making their nightly rounds.Cons:1) Installing can be complicated if you're not an electrician or really handy. I ended up hiring one, so the installation cost far exceeded the equipment cost.2) In-use, the Quad View (four cameras) doesn't work once a motion sensor is triggered. It flips to full screen view of that camera, and won't switch to another camera until the timer (5 sec, 15 sec, or 30 sec) is over. So, if you're trying to track movement camera-to-camera, or simply to see who is at the door after they've triggered a walkway camera, you have to wait. If your visitor is standing quietly at the door, the sensor doesn't work & it goes back to Quad View; you have to manually switch to that camera. All of this takes time, and the audio doesn't work on Quad View--so meanwhile your visitor is waiting at the door wondering what's taking so long.It apparently has a Skype function, but I've never used this, so I can't comment on this.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice camera", "Author": "David Wells", "ReviewID": "R1543TZRPNYPSP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "These are nice units except for the fact you cannot put them where they will get directly weathered.

The video camera was a bit harder to set up outside, since we wanted to view our front door and have it out of the way of rain, but my husband managed to do it fairly easily.
