{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very poor system", "Author": "video_guy", "ReviewID": "R1JHLNH5SE8UTH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've purchased this in a retailer store and will be returning it today. For starters, the system is poorly documented; The iPhone application constantly crashes while trying to setup the network; even when it doesn't crash, you cannot simply detect the device in your network - so it is up to you to figure out which IP address was assigned to it.You will also need to provide a Google account and your PASSWORD (wondering why that is?) to be able to use the device. I've triggered the alarm a few times just for sake of testing, and never got a single notification or image via email as I would expect. So I don't really see the point of setting up a Google account if it's never used.Photos or video taken when the alarm gets triggered will remain in the device itself - which is useless if the device itself is stolen.  Monitoring is not possible except from your local LAN/WLAN, in other words, forget about remote monitoring. Again, what is the point of having an Internet connection and a google account.Bottom line, this is a poorly conceived (or poorly executed) device, almost completely worthless.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "DOES NOT WORK ON MY PHONE...", "Author": "Windy", "ReviewID": "R35LKD8YMCH2HF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This has never worked right, the company said that is was Googles fault because they made changes and they had to go and make changes also. I have waited and waited and it has never worked on my new phone. The company always gives me some excuse and I really was hoping this would be great living in a place that I can't put holes in the walls...BUT IT IS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B007FZKNVE"}}
