The picture quality is only decent. Even in full light, you should not expect anything even remotely as clear as what you see on the product page. Whatever these photos were taken with, it was not the camera that comes with this monitor. The sound from the camera to the monitor is also decent. The \"talk to baby\" feature is pointless. The voice comes out as echoed and loud. It's like taking to you baby over the grocery store loudspeaker. This is not comforting and this feature is pointless. (In fairness, I've not found a baby monitor that performs this function well.There are a couple of things I really like about this monitor. I appreciate that the cord for the base unit and the camera are interchangeable. I also find the belt clip feature quite clever. The stand for the monitor twists around and becomes a belt clip. Very clever.At the time of this review, this monitor stands around the $100 price point. This monitor just isn't worth it. If you want something at this point, I suggest the Levana Sophia. It has the same basic features and costs a little less, but has a better picture and a bigger screen.", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good value but lots of other options on the market.", "Author": "AreYouKidding?", "ReviewID": "R1RK1BREWHM911", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Meets your basic needs but is missing some of the real helpful features like Zoom and VOX. I would recommend the Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision instead; it has a larger screen, VOX, and is less $.The screen is ultra-small which makes it very difficult to see if you baby is awake or not.The screenshot they show in the product images is 100% fake/simulated You will not get anything close to that quality; very misleading by Lorex.The antenna also came loose after a few uses. It no longer snaps back into place.", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very nice", "Author": "Atomic Tofu \"Code of Bushido\"", "ReviewID": "R1H9KSARIVW1YC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wasn't sure what to expect quality wise until I powered it up, since it's small and shiny plastic with a small screen.  But ended up very easy to use with a lot of functionality.  Has little yellow/orange lights that could be considered night or comfort lights.  The IR function kicks on automatically.  You could use the mic functionality too but not sure if that will frighten your baby or better to communicate with other parent in room with the monitor.  All in all a very good product, good design, functionality, and the ability to add in extra cameras though I have yet to test that part out.", "Date": "May 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lorex Baby Monitor", "Author": "Dr. Wilfredo M.

Upon opening the box I loved compact it was but wondered how the range would be affected. Setting up was easy and we've been using it a couple of weeks.

So far, battery life is as promised and we charge every other day.", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "A lot packed in a handheld...", "Author": "A. Hudson \"bisou bisou\"", "ReviewID": "R3W1QIUMY8C51H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Lorex is a well known name in my home. I have used their cameras for years and use them for my home security. The only thing I don\u2019t like is after just a few months their monitors seem to turn to black and white and the battery no longer charges. I can\u2019t say that about this one but if it happens, I will update this review.Taking this out of the box, Lorex really impressed me with how they secured the camera and monitor. They were both covered with protection film. This was very important to me considering I exchanged a camera (in the past) due to no protection and it was scratched all over. Setting up this camera took minutes! The one thing I love about their cameras, there really is no limitations of angels. The camera has a built in amber night light which is useful.The monitor has everything that Lorex offers but neatly placed in a handheld. The screen is small but you are not missing anything. You can also zoom in. The one thing I love about this monitor is you can hit a button which puts the monitor in standby mode. No more powering off and on. I have used this button a lot! The back of the monitor has a stand which you can use as a kickstand to have the monitor standing up next to you while you work, on your nightstand, or it swivels so you can place it on your belt/pants. I will say this has great range! I have the camera in my daughter\u2019s room and keep the monitor mostly in the living area in the evening and I have not had a range issue. Color is good but knowing my past experience, I fear it will fade to black and white. If that happens, I will come back and update this review.Two things I do not like, you are able to pair an additional three cameras to this monitor but it is very small. I love that you are capable to add more cameras, but this monitor is so small, I am not sure I would add an additional camera. Second flaw, even when the battery is fully charged, it seems to drain fast, even in standby mode. I have had that issue with past Lorex systems but not right out of the box.I have been using this for weeks and love the size and that I can carry it around and place it next to me or place it on my belt. It is very handy. If you are looking for a middle of the road camera, this is a good one. It is a lot better than a lot of basic cameras out there but I would not expect it to last a long time. If that is what you are looking for, this one is for you.", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic sound and video quality", "Author": "S. Brooks", "ReviewID": "R1IBGY0C1B1X8B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was able to get this monitor set up in under a minute. All you have to do is plug it in and set it up in the room. I was very pleased with the video and sound quality. The battery life on the video monitor was quite good (plenty of time to get things done around the house without having to be tied to a power cord). I like that you have the option to turn off the video feature (to conserve battery or if you're sleeping and just need the sound alert). I really liked the ability to talk into the monitor. I tried this out in my older son's room (he's 4). It was funny to see his reaction when I told him to get back into his bed. It's been great for our family.", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Been very helpful!", "Author": "J. Hansen", "ReviewID": "RXQ21X5M85R2E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After receiving the video baby monitor, we were eager to test it. Unfortunately, upon trying to use it, we couldn't get more than 2 feet away from the camera before the video monitor said \"out of range.\" Running through the troubleshooting tips in the manual, we were still unable to get the monitor to function correctly. There isn't much use in a baby monitor that only works within 2 feet of the camera.After calling Lorex, and walking through a few additional suggestions, they determined our unit was defective. Customer service had a new unit sent out, and provided a return label for the defective unit.The new unit was night and day compared to the old one. After setting it up in our daughters room, we were able to go downstairs and \"monitor\" her without issue. We love the ability to speak into the video monitor, and have her hear us speaking. It's kind of fun to see her \"freak out\" by us speaking to her without actually being in the room. This is our first experience using a video monitor, and it's definitely light years ahead of the old audio versions we used with past children.We're happy. Customer service is very helpful should there be any issues. The monitor works as expected, provides a great set of features, and is one that we're glad to have for our youngest. We're confident we'll get many years of use out of the monitor with additional children.", "Date": "May 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "An overall high quality video monitor", "Author": "Surface to Air Missle", "ReviewID": "R22X7FXXKMQZDX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Lorex BB1811 Wireless Baby monitor is a great monitor for the price if you are looking for a video picture.Installation is easy right out of the box and the unit is surprisingly small but it works.  The controls and options are intuitive and you will be able to use this monitor right out of the box. The video screen has a night vision mode which is helpful for a darker nursery but the screen is quite small.  The audio is clear enough to hear when baby is stirring and the range of the unit worked all throughout our condo.We also have the Levana Astra 3.5 which we like better for the more flexible camera and better screen but this is a pretty comparable monitor for less.", "Date": "May 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "I used this for a pet and security monitor.", "Author": "Courtland J. Carpenter", "ReviewID": "R2U30N2M2XZQDB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "While it appears cheaply made, it actually is a lot more solid than I expected visually.  I like the convenience of the hand-held unit and the picture is clear and decent size, especially for the money.  Most of all I like the night vision this thing has.  I paid over a thousand dollars some years back for a fancy sony camcorder, it was supposed to have some of the best low light specs.  Now it's old about 1995, but I can see the tech has improved a lot for cheap.  My camcorder quickly needed more ambient light if even in a semi-dark room.  This camera shows a night display crisp and clear.  I'd want this for full blown security system because it would really spot the criminals at night.  I couldn't test it as a baby monitor, but I did scare the cat by spying on it and then calling it's name when it went for the litter box.  It was fun to watch it jump. Recommended, and more uses than just a baby monitor.", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works really really well, cheap screen though", "Author": "Values Privacy", "ReviewID": "RKG66UJXZGQQC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all it works, really really well.The night mode must use IR because you can see everything in a pitch black room and it doesn't produce any light. Amazing.The camera stays plugged in, the screen is rechargeable but I would keep it plugged in by my bed (since that is when you want it on for long periods of time) anyway. The battery is just a bonus so I don't want to complain about the battery life.My one complaint is the quality of the screen. Think mid 90s mp3 player screen. My guess is this is where they saved money and why they can offer it at a low price.", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice monitor, small screen", "Author": "Lon J.

Reasonably pricedI've been using it now for several weeks and quite pleased. The monitor works throughout the entire house (including the basement!).

Wish battery life was a little longer", "Author": "W. Chang", "ReviewID": "RNRJWCKJN19XO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I\u2019d like to preclude this review saying this is the first baby monitor with a screen I have ever used.  That being said, this is a great product for any new parent and is relatively lost cost for the peace and mind of having video rather than just audio.Installation essentially doesn\u2019t exist.  You simply plug in the monitors and push a button and you\u2019re good to go.  The handset for the parents is rechargeable, however, I noticed \u2018up to 7 hours\u2019 is a bit of a stretch.  I found the handset lasting a little over 5 hours on average and up to 6 a few times.  The battery life is completely dependent  on how often the screen is on (which automatically turns off, and then on again if there is movement from the baby).  Not a big deal since the handset can be plugged in at any time but as a potential buyer, something you may want to be aware of.The monitor comes with a great set of features.  The screen has great imagery, even at night, and is not blurry in the least.  Additionally, it has the two way talk feature where your voice, perhaps singing? :) can soothe your baby at night!  The range of the product is great.  It claims 450ft outdoor/150ft indoor.  I got to about 130ish feet inside before the range started to be dicey. I did not test the outdoor range a great deal but I was able to walk to and from my mailbox and it seemed to hold up well.The product can accommodate up to four cameras which is awesome in case you have another infant or even a young child (or pet?) you would like to keep an eye on.  I did not get to test this feature but it seems to be able to move from one camera to another with the simple click of a button.Overall, I think this is a great product.  Is it the Cadillac of baby monitors?  Probably not.  But at less than $100, I think you\u2019re getting a great deal for the peace of mind and features it provides.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works well", "Author": "M.
