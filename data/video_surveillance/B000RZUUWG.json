We have it in a room that at night is lit only with a 40 Watt bulb, and the picture is grainy, but more than sufficient to tell what our baby is doing.  We can't see if his eyes are open, for instance, but we can see if he's still, looking around, moving around, etc.If you application is not dependent on high image quality, then you're likely to be happy.

The tuner pot is a little funky.We have plenty of interference in our house - PA speakers, guitar amps, wireless routers, cell phone boosters, and even a metal roof, so its not surprising that there is some issues with reception, in the form if lines.

I can get about 100 feet away (cam outside, rec. inside) from the receiever using a battery before the signal pixelates and craps out. Pretty much double that when you're using the AC adapter.It serves the purpose it was made for, a small discreet camera, it's not an HD picture but it's pretty good and works for what I need it to do, look at who is coming up the driveway and what animal strew my trash up and down the street this week.

I don't know why everyone with one-star reviews simply gives up on these cameras.  The receiver unit has a tuner knob which gave me the impression signals change easily.

The distance is 50m for sure!  (not feet, 1m ~ 3ft)  I have a completely wood framed house.  Every time I move the camera, I expect to do a little tweaking with both the receiver antenna or the tuning knob.  Sometimes there's a short delay for receiving a good-quality picture with the tuning knob and perhaps this is why some people give up easily.There's another product on Amazon called a EZCap USB device for about $8 and ships from Hong Kong.  This enables receiving the signals from the receiver and into your computer similar to a web cam.

I purchased this one specifically because it is supposed to be 1.2 Ghz as opposed to the more popular 2.4 Ghz model which has interference issues with Wi-Fi routers. The bar code sticker on the box itself says 1.2 Ghz, but the receiver unit inside the box says 2.4 right on it. Also, the product manual included is titled 2.4 Ghz. I tested the camera with the receiver next to my Wi-Fi router and interference was not as bad as my previous camera so it's possible that the receiver and manual are mis-labeled, but I will never know for sure.As for video quality, range, etc. You get what you pay for. This does exactly what I expected it to do and that's good enough for me. I use this for RC vehicles. It will have interference from the radio controller, but for the money I can't complain.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "hellga", "ReviewID": "R1SJMH6R9ZS71A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It works very well I know exactly who is in my driveway before I go to the door or not.", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "On time delivery service, but bad product", "Author": "Luan Tran \"bgmctl\"", "ReviewID": "R20PDYMNT6I0K5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Signal is extremely weak.

First, it was Post-Its. Then my three good clicky-top pens. Mousepads, headphones, those emergency airline bottles of gin in the bottom drawer -- all gone. I resolved to fight this sticky-fingered felon, and to protect what precious little stuff I had left.This little gem was just the ticket. Not only would I stop the thieving hound from taking my stuff -- I'd catch him red-handed on tape, to boot. And then... well, I don't know what then. Maybe I'd turn him in to the cops for a good beating. Or let the company send him to some sort of anti-theft deprogramming cult. I could torture him until he told me where he took my precious clicky-tops. The possibilities were endless.And this camera is fantastic. I dug through my pocket change to confirm the picture -- and it really IS the size of a penny! I hid the camera on a shelf in my cubicle and waited for the corporate cat burglar to strike again.Which he did, apparently. When I came in the next morning, the camera was gone.
