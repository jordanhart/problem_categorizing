Purchased this item to keep an \"eye\" on things when I'm away. Worked great at first but does not help much now. Save your money and look for another brand. The color displayed from the cameras are way off and cannot be adjusted to anything close to the right color. Have used two different monitors and a HD T.V. to view and adjust color to no avail. It was a simple set up on the positive side.Mine keeps saying \"no hdd\" only after 6 months of use. I hope everyone else has better luck.", "Date": "July 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "very good", "Author": "Maurcapy", "ReviewID": "RUCL8I07K4FB2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "excelent product, good quality and is really aLL the specifications, i recomended this product, i love it and is to usefull, is excelent", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Save for something better....", "Author": "M.

Also if I wasn't already very familiar with Cameras, Networking, port Forwarding etc, this would have probably caused a heart attack for anyone else.the Color of the cameras are a bit off because of no IR cut filter (it pretty much accepts IR light all day long too, distorting blacks and greens) I got over that, it seemed to get better after 2 days. Also, the cameras come with 6mm lenses which isn't exactly wide angle, I ordered 2.8mm lenses for them today. with 6mm lenes, I get a picture about 20 wide 60 feet away. Not suitable for indoor use.The interface of the DVR is difficult to navigate on the Playback side.As for the remote viewing, it works well with the Web interface on a computer, but you can only view 4 cameras at a time, and playback searching is terrible. if you're looking for a client to install directly to the computer you'll have to find another one for another Zmodo brand, the CD that came with my package was blank.on the Mobile phone I can get up to 4 cameras at once, but it often freezes the DVR and requires a reboot. that's no good if you're not at home to reboot it.If you're looking for a system that will just record and view cameras this will do it, but now that I got this, I'm going to start upgrading each camera and eventually the DVR and switch the whole system over..", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "This product is Crap.
