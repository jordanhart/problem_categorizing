{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not bad", "Author": "MrJ", "ReviewID": "R3UXJNF2REEIYL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the starter set from target, one 8'' monitor and 2 indoor/outdoor cameras and over all they are great not the best of the best but i'd give them a 7 out of 10 for over all performance. I ordered this one because target no longer carries the set and this one came down in price.Mounting was easy and even though the camera mount is cheap it holds the camera all the same. The pairing is very simple and for me during the day i get an easy 75 to 100' motion activation per camera and 25 to 30' at night. Night is grainy but works and daylight hours are very detailed.. I see clearly 200 feet and as far as 3 blocks without motion activation of course. Monitor hooks up to TV and splits four ways on screen or rotates between frames. YOU can NOT use it like an IP cam according to the manual unless you sign up for a skype account which i think is cheesy yet over all its affordable and mine records up to 8 gig sd card about 3 days on motion activation on busy street...I will order the last one soon for a full set..", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Rose Holly", "ReviewID": "RNNNBQ9XPC61R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have wanted a security system for a while. We live in the country so this makes it so easy..Only thing we can't use it inside our Quonset. Not sure if it is to far from the receiver or what so we mounted on our house and aimed at Quonset. They are great at night too..Love it.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "A Nice Camera.", "Author": "Dan Hundley", "ReviewID": "R3GW0MI1O9YD9U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It was very easy to install and program.

As far as clarity it is just fine for the 480 lines I get. I can make out most everything. I have had these for 3 months on continuously with no issues. AND the intercom feature features a good speaker as well as a mic. It was easy to Pair with my Uniden UDR444. Daylight gives you even more motion detection range depending on the setting you have in your Uniden Unit.
