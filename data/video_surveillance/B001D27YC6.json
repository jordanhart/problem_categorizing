{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very good product", "Author": "ChillyLos", "ReviewID": "RMZD4BIE34XZ1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ordered the product to use while traveling, for extra security in hotel rooms. I chose it over some of the other similar alarm door stops because the alarm sensitivity is adjustable and it has an on/off switch. I haven't used it in a hotel room yet but I tested it in my home. It seems to work great. The alarm is VERY loud! It works very well as a door jam making it extremely difficult to open the door.  It jammed the door on hardwood floors and carpeted floors, but so-so on my tile floors which are kinda smooth.  The alarm feature worked very well in all cases. I had to increase the sensivity to high with the tile floors.Overall I think this is a great inexpensive home and travel security product. I plan to buy a couple more to give as gifts to a few female family members who live alone and don't have a home security system. The great thing about this product is that it not only sounds an alarm but it also stops the intruder from entering the room.The only weaknesses of the product are that it may not work as a door jam if you have very smooth tile floors or if the bottom of your door is very high off the floor.  The alarm will probably work in both these cases, if you set the sensitivity on med or high. If your tile floors have some texture, it should work fine.", "Date": "November 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "I like it!", "Author": "Doodleboy", "ReviewID": "R28BV53XY7Q7VC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked this one instead of the other GE product because this one also jams the door from opening.1. Its pretty loud.2. The high sensitivity setting sometimes causes it to trigger when I am placing it on the floor after turning it on. (These things are little difficult to turn on while on the floor)3. Jams the door being opened enough to not let the intruder push the door open and quickly shut the alarm.4. Build quality is solid.5. Could be used for horizontal sliding doors also.Works as advertised. Will buy again without hesitation if I need in future.===============================================================================Update - Jan 2012:After 1.5 years, this thing is still working like new, and I turn it off(morning) and on(night) about 5 days a week. I purchased another similar, but a little different doorstop alarm from Amazon. The difference between this and that is that this one keeps screaming once the foot/door is taken away after the peddle is pressed whereas the other one stops. From a security perspective, this difference is HUGE: Once the alarm is triggered, if the intruder pulls the door back, the alarm will still continue in this one, whereas it will immediately stop in the other one. You DEFINITELY want the alarm to continue ringing (unless the switch is manually turned off).A minor negative, due to the same feature, is that if you move this around on a daily basis (like I do), then you'll have to manually switch it off-then-back-on every time it triggers. In the other one, you have to do nothing since it stops itself. I'd still choose this, esp. for doors that are far away from my ears and even more so for doors that just need this thing left in front of them most of the time.", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "super door stop alarm", "Author": "L.

Not a big deal, since it is ear-drum piercingly loud. But the two sources of info should be in agreement.The battery compartment is easy to access. It is one of those standard \"push\" clip doors. The alarm is VERY LOUD.The only problem I've had with it is the grip. It does not work well with a door that has a high sweep. The grip pad on the bottom of the alarm is good, but not \"grippy\" enough to grab the floor when a door with a high sweep is opened onto it (i.e., one that doesn't come close enough to the floor to press down very far on the alarm mechanism). But at $6 it's a nice secondary alarm. When I use it I set it up so that as the door opens onto it, it pushes back into a heavy, stable object I've put behind it, and that then causes the door to come in better contact with it and trigger the alarm.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Does seem to do what it says", "Author": "A.

If I wedge it TOO tightly, it sounds the alarm as soon as I turn on the switch.3) Pressure on the leading edge will not trip the alarm--pressure must be applied at least half-way back on the trip lever. This alarm wouldn't work at all with a door that has a small clearance to the floor.4) The alarms are very INsensitive to pressure, and the sensitivity switch seems to have no effect.5) The only way I can see this alarm working is to screw a block of wood behind it to hold it in place.
