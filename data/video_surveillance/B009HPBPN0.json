Maier", "ReviewID": "RKDJVWIZTI7SJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After having the front bumper stolen off my car (who does that?), and learning my old Samsung DVR froze up, I decided I needed an upgrade.I should have done this sooner.  Setup is a snap, the DVR includes a mouse and the User Interface is easy to navigate.  Wireless Monitoring setup has a few different options, just take your time and follow the instructions.  I love being away from home and being able to check the cameras around my house.  The motion detection system is designated via a grid of 15x 15 (IIRC) squares that you can select to indicate motion detection area.  This way, you can leave something like a sidewalk or street out of motion detection.  You can also adjust sensitivity between a level of 1 - 10.  Motion detection works decently in low life, but I would recommend cameras that handle your night vision needs to accompany this DVR.I setup a free e-mail address with Outlook.com strictly for the motion detection e-mail notifications, and because the Outlook Android app supports \"Push\" notification.  Within 15 seconds of motion detection, my phone beeps at me and notifies me of a motion detection message.  The snapshot that the system takes is in attachment form, but it's usually less that 10kb, so it downloads very quickly.The Q-See android app works well.  You log in to your router's public IP with the specific port you designate.  You save your login information so there's no need to enter passwords over and over.  There is only a 1 - 2 second delay in the live video feed over Verizon's 4G network.You can also view live feed from any computer with an ActiveX compatible browser.I used a 4-port Network Extender from Netgear to create an access point for where I installed the DVR.  This way, you don't need to install the DVR next to your modem or router if the location isn't best for you.Sure, I probably went a little overboard here, but I tell you--I sleep a lot better at night.", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty good - Would Recommend", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2UAJ78U4EL4ZK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am only giving this 3 stars because of the documentation and setup issues I had.  The product works well and I do like it. It looks like the engineers wrote and reviewed the documentation.  They really need a good RAS engineer to evaluate there products before they release them.I got this product to attach to the composite video output of a Legrand On-q Category 5 Camera Module CM1011 which provides composite video out. (the yellow video wire that plugs into the composite input of your TV)  First the documentation was not clear that this would work and it was hard to get the support folks to give me specifications as to what input this recorder would accept. But for the record it does work and this is the required input.I tried this unit with both a Visio TV and a RCA TV for the monitor. There is a problem with the remote control for the unit as it uses the same frequency as the Visio TV and there is no way to change the remote frequency.  Luckily you won't use it anyway.  You will use the mouse (which comes with it) to interface to the unit. The remote did not interfere with the RCA TV.I use this product and view the camera's via the internet and remotely.  There design is nice but it is a little buggy.  I am using this so that I can view the cameras and the recordings remotely using a windows browser via a URL and using an Android Tablet.  There are several issues with doing this.The QSEE Start Guides are pretty good but they need some clarification editing.  This is where they could use a good RAS (Reliability, Availability and Serviceability) engineer.1. They always reference Internet Explorer in the guides as the browser.  This browser IS REQUIRED as you must download their addon for the remote viewing to work.  This means that Firefox, Chrome or other browsers will not work.  I never use Internet Explorer.  So I was using Firefox and tried Chrome, before I finally figured out that this would only work with IE and then download the Activex add-on.  Very annoying. took me quite awhile to realize this. I also means you can NOT use your browser on you Android tablet to access the VCR.  You must use their app. The IE browser works better than the app. Sometimes the app crashes.IE is the only browser that has native support for ActiveX addon's.  You can down load a Chrome extension that will support Activex. Firefox does not support ActiveX because it opens the door to security violations on your system. Microsoft warns of this on their Safety and Security Center. [...] Qsee needs to find a way around using an ActiveX add-on.2. In the Remote Monitoring Quick Start Guide, you will want to setup a Dynamic Domain Name Service if you IP provider changes your IP address regularly. I did not realize that I need to add the port address behind the DDNS url when accessing the DVR. They should show an example ie: name.myq-see.com:85. I thought the url was all I needed and not the port also.3. The Android app keeps resetting the More setting for WiFi and turning it off every time it is loaded.. Finally figured out that before I do anything with this app I need to turn WiFi back on.  It will not work if I turn it on after I get a failure.4. On the locally attached monitor and using the mouse I just double click on the playback record list and it plays it back.  This does not work on the remote playback list on the browser or android app.Overall a nice product.", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works very well with few caveats", "Author": "Surface to Air Missle", "ReviewID": "RQKO7CTSW070K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Q-see unit basically acts your DVR box for home security and I have it hooked up to some Defender external cameras.  The unit is very easy to set up, automate and record.  500 GB is a nice size hard drive which will allows you to record quite a bit of video.  You can choose which cameras you want recording, and receive email alerts.The user interface is not as easy to use as say your cable DVR box but I was able to get it working with somewhat of a learning curve. The advanced motion detector recording was somewhat wonky and inconsistent with my setup but it was not a function I wanted to use so I didn't spend that much time with it.Otherwise, you have lots of features to choose from and if you need a DVR surveillance recording unit, this could be a great choice.", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice piece for the entry level DVR", "Author": "TMC \"nivisionbat\"", "ReviewID": "R3W4LHJFZLRZSW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this Q-see DVR to replace my broken LTS DVR, I still keep 4 cameras.

After my SVAT DVR died, after 4 years, I decided to replace it with something affordable.  My SVAT DVR was not the easiest to set up, especially when it came to remote access which I eventually gave up on.  The Q-See was easier to set up and I can now monitor my home from work or any Windows computer via Internet Explorer.  The more I probe into the software, the more cool surprises I find.  For example, cameras can be individually adjusted for color, brightness etc.  It can email me if it picks up a motion event if I choose to set it.  But my favorite feature is being able to program the cameras to block out sections of the camera viewing area that can trigger unnecessary motion.  For example a bush that moves easily in the wind can be blocked out so the camera won't pick up it's motion and unnecessarily record it.  In that setting, a grid system appears across the entire viewing area and you simply click on the squares you don't want the camera to detect, it's simple and it works.  Q-See's customer service is pretty good as well.  They were able to help me set up remote access and port forwarding on my house router.It comes with a fully functional remote that you can use for monitoring and playing back footage.  The mouse is good as well but limited by it's cord length (approx. 5ft?).  A wireless mouse would have made this system awesome.  And \"No\" you can't use a wireless mouse from your PC, it didn't work when I tried it.....bummer.In the future, I hope to see DVRs that use solid state drives over the old school motorized hard drives.  In my opinion, solid state drives are more reliable and long lasting.  These DVRs are on all the time so their shelf life is limited in my opinion.Initially I was going to buy another SVAT DVR when the company offered me a substantial discount.  With the discount, that system would have still cost over $200.  I am so glad I went with the Q-See.  This was a much better value at the Amazon price.
