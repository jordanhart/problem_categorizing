{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent dvr for the money!", "Author": "BK63 \"bklosens\"", "ReviewID": "R20B00IW8NC4LA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My company has used a lot of Zmodo DVR's and some other much more expensive ones.  I prefer the Zmodo's to the more expensive, (more than twice the money) because they work just as well if not better.  I had some issues with this one getting the motion recording to work as there are several extra settings in other menus but once tech support got back to me I was all set.  Even if you are set to record motion, there is a manual record menu and you have to uncheck the cameras from that because it will override other settings.  I saw another review where the guy said he could not get motion to work.  Just contact support if you can't figure it out.  The motion recording on this unit is excellent.  The menu's seem to be enhanced from the units I have used at work that look like this one.  I did not buy a \"package deal\" because typically the cameras are crap.  If you want a great dvr, this is the one.  Buy your cameras seperately and look for some Sony 1/3 vs anything that says it is a 1/4 lense.  You will get a much better picture and more of a wide angle than with a 1/4 lense and at least 500 tv lines and you'll love it.", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Reliable device", "Author": "Saleh Ibrahim", "ReviewID": "R2SHZG5OMBTRKA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "since I installed this equipment about 4 months ago, it never had any problem and still functioning smoothly although it is in power and running 24/7 and never was switched off.The brand name, ZMODO, was on the box, but I couldn't find it on the device itself !!

The second NVR seems to be working however the recording playback is touchy. This is a basic recorder and works better than a time lapse VCR. The instructions do not detail the processes very well so you do have to call support to guild you threw the details however I found a lot of information on this item on U tube. I like the fact it has a 1 TB drive installed. I personally would look for another system with a more user friendly software next time but this works as a good first unit.", "Date": "August 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great unit for the money!", "Author": "Bryon", "ReviewID": "R24JF2KN91ZI5B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice unit for the money..
