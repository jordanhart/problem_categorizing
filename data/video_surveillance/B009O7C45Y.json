No power line needed if you use cat5 cable. Their customer service is horrable. Called the tech because the system wouldn't record and got an answering machine. Sent two emails to their tech line and didn't get answers. Still can't get the system to record and I installed a new Seagate hard drive as the manual states. Cameras work very well, system is easy to understand. I have a record problem and no one to solve the problem. The system recognizes the hard drive and serial number, but won't record, giving me a \"No Hard Drive Disc\" error message. Still waiting for a resolution. Finally spoke to a tech after my 5th attempt. Unit is defective and I am returning it.", "Date": "October 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$352.34", "Features": "Display Resolution: 720x480 / 720x576 (NTSC/PAL), VGA - 1280x1024\nDisplay Mode: 1/ 4/ 8/ 1+7/ Sequence/ PIP\nControl Interface: Mouse, Keypad, IR Remote Controller\nPick-up Device: 1/3\" Color CCD\nLens: 3.6mm\nConnect DVR to VGA and analog monitors for easy setup -no PC needed!\nMonitor remotely from a computer with Internet connection\nStream video to your 3G mobile phone while you are away\nMonitor up to 8 cameras simultaneously\nHolds up to a single 2TB hard disc drive", "Name": "Encore ENDSS-R4D8:USEN-NV2 Digital Surveillance Recorders", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZfTbwmPAL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009O7C45Y"}}
