{"Reviews": [{"Title": "UPDATE", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R18PMNUO3A6U1T", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this DVR and the jury is still out on my opinion.  The product is full of neat features like the higher end recorders but I am not having much success in obtaining clear images.  I have four outdoor cameras and three of them are different brand names.  The VGA monitor I am using is a good monitor but all of the images are weak and fuzzy. I have tried two monitors and two TVs but with the same result.  The tech at Watchdog said it was probably my cameras but I am not sold on that.  I will continue to tweak the camera settings in attempts to get satisfactory pictures. Before buying this DVR you may want to read  more reviews, if you can find them. Update - After much research I have discovered that the less than clear images being produced from this DVR is common with most DVRs.  The only other issue I have have with this DVR is the sensitivity control.  I have my recordings set to \"motion.\"  The DVR's sensitivity control will record bugs, light changes, etc. no matter what sensitivity level you set it at.  The most positive aspect of this DVR is the 5 year warranty.  That is worth buying this DVR by it self.", "Date": "December 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "Justin", "ReviewID": "R2UN0Z3Z8EBPK5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am in the surveillance business and this is what I use.
