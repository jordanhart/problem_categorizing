I have tested and installed numerous CCTV DVRs and found this one has quite a few bells and whistles for the price point.  See details below or the PROS/CONS list for more.  (See my photos under this product for more info too.)It is an 8 channel DVR with H.264 video compression.  That means it can record up to 8 analog cameras of your choosing, including audio if the camera supports it.  The H.264 means clearer video while using less hard drive space versus older video technologies.The DVR video output is via VGA, BNC, or HDMI.  So you should be able to run a cable to wherever you need to for local monitoring purposes.The menu system is nice and presents a good resolution.  It's not as clunky as others I've seen on other brands.  It is easy to navigate through the menus and it even has a built-in startup wizard in the software, which I've not seen before on DVRs, in case the included documentation is not enough.Important features for this DVR are that is can record 30 frame per second (fps) for all 8 channels.  That's good, fluid motion video.  It also allows numerous video streams at the same time, so viewing it remotely on your iPhone won't cannibalize the main video feed.  You can stream/record to different places simultaneously without performance loss.  (Google `pentaplex' for more info.)This DVR also offers motion detection, email alerts for video loss, motion, etc. and multi-user capabilities.  You can also run PTZ cameras on it if you wish.  Each camera (channel) can be configured for different settings, allowing a fully customizable set up.  For example, you may want full D1 resolution at 30fps for street cameras to catch moving vehicles, but half D1 10fps for a side area with little activity.This DVR is advertised as a universal viewer through software installed on a computer, a web browser, or a smart phone.  However, it is not as limitless as it seems.  The software can be downloaded and installed on Windows or Mac OS, but the web browser feature is limited.  It works on Internet Explorer (IE) 10 and below, but it must install an ActiveX add-on for the IE browser.  If you are not an administrator on the computer upon which you're using, this will not install and it will not work.Additionally, it shows to support Google Chrome and Firefox browsers, but it does not do so natively.  You must download third party add-ons from various individuals to use these browsers.  I didn't like that part.  On the up side though, all administrative features were available in the web browser mode as in the software mode.I installed the iPhone app and tested it out.  Be sure to get the viewer app for the series you have (QT, QS, etc) or it won't work.  They have several Q-See viewers, which is a little confusing.  Once installed, the app was easy to set up and you can simply swipe left or right to change channels/cameras.On a side note, I visited the Q-See website to check for firmware updates and it has a good layout with easy to find information and FAQs for the products.  The knowledge base was very nice too.Overall, I'm fairly impressed with the feature set.  I do wish they offered better browser support NATIVELY, as well as an option for viewing on a computer where one may not have administrative privileges.  But for the price, I would definitely recommend it.PROS:* Full D1 resolution on all cameras* 240fps for full video on all cameras* Pentaplex multi-streaming capabilities* iPhone and Android apps available* Full administrative functions/configuration available via web browser* HDMI, BNC, and VGA ports* Can record audio as well* H.264 video compression = good video at low space requirements* Motion detection, alarm trigger, or scheduled recording* Windows 8 and IE 10 compatible* Small form factor case can be discreetly hiddenCONS:* Internet Explorer users must have admin rights on computer* No native Firefox or Chrome support. (requires 3rd party add-ons)* Motion detection mask blocks could be smaller to allow more finite blocking of a particular area.", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Motion detection randomly goes haywire in D1 mode....", "Author": "Anonymous123", "ReviewID": "R2P69QO8DH7B1A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this QS558 DVR a week ago, based on a balanced approach between cost and other user reviews. I have it set to record only upon motion detection. After a week of use on D1 quality, the major problem is the \"advanced motion detection\" capability:When in D1 quality mode, even though no motion is happening in the field of view of the camera(s), the DVR still records...non-stop....So at this point you might be thinking 'Oh silly, maybe you just have the sensitivity too high and something triggers DVR to record (like a bird, shadows, etc..etc...). Well let me elaborate further:In normal view, there is a little red guy/red dot that appears in the lower left corner of the camera(s) when motion is detected and recording starts. This way you can tell if the system is recording/not-recording. I noticed these symbols on the screen even though nothing was moving in the frame of view of the camera. So I investigated further....In the settings section, under the AREA column, you can mask areas of the camera view where you don't want motion detection to be seen/activated. When setting this feature, the entire camera view is shown on the display, overlaid with GREEN boxes/grid. When the boxes are green, no motion is detected. When some boxes turn RED, then those boxes detected motion. Under normal operation, when something moves, the boxes enclosing that movement turn RED, whereas the others stay GREEEN.My problem is that sometimes the entire screen is filled with RED boxes, even though nothing is moving on the screen (shadows, wind/trees, etc...). This in turn records on the hard drive, until it no longer \"sees motion\" aka the boxes are green and the sensitivity level is matched. Adjusting the sensitivity doesn't fix this...it just seems to get randomly STUCK in this mode, where it records non-stop for no reason. Even though there is no motion detected, all the boxes are red, therefore triggering non-stop recording.When it does work properly, it detects motion (based on the sensitivity level you set) and starts recording for the amount of time you set it. If no motion is detected, it does not record...seems straightforward enough.I just don't understand what is going on... I have the latest firmware/updates uploaded on the DVR. I tried a reset (load default settings), power cycles, played with sensitivity levels. I lowered the recording quality to CIF and that seemed to help, but then what's the point of advertising this DVR as full D1 with advanced motion detection when it doesn't work properly on D1 ??UPDATE #1:  April 2, 2013:  I contacted Q-See technical support and they are giving me the basic troubleshooting steps (sensitivity level, firmware, etc...). The only way the DVR records properly during motion is if you put the system in CIF quality mode. Obviously there is a problem between D1 quality and motion detection. I hope they will release a firmware update SOON!!! I also posted another picture to show you the motion detection software when the DVR is in CIF mode and D1 mode...UPDATE #2:  April 2, 2013: Q-See told me that their Software Development team is aware of this issue and are trying to come up with a fix. Hopefully they will have a firmware update out in a few weeks...UPDATE #3:  April 4, 2013:  While Q-see is working on this issue, I tried to play around with some settings, see if perhaps something might help (besides CIF quality mode). I noticed that when in D1 mode and the DVR is set to auto-maintain every day (from the Maintenance section), it records in D1 only when motion is detected. But, occasionally, it records non-stop, even though no motion is detected. This has nothing to do with sensitivity level because all the motion detection boxes/grid on the screen go RED when the problem starts. This D1 -- motion detection problem is highly inconsistent and random... I am worried that Q-See will no be able to properly re-create this problem and they will claim that it's just my imagination, improper sensitivity level, etc..etc..etc...  :(", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Problems with motion record on D1", "Author": "K. Dommer", "ReviewID": "R1ZZL5YWJSKW88", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first video surveillance system so I can't really compare it to others.  However, for the price I think it was a pretty good deal.  For the most part I like the entire system... I think the cameras are adequate for this price range, the DVR interface (both directly connected via monitor as well as through an IE browser) seems to be pretty nice and user-friendly.My only complaint (and it is kind of a big one):  At some point I noticed that the DVR had gone from recording only during motion (the way I configured it) to recording virtually 24/7 on all connected channels.  After trying some of my own troubleshooting, I finally emailed Q-See support to try and figure out what was going on.  Overall their support is okay, but as with many products, don't expect real help with highly technical problems.  I'd consider myself very knowledgeable with gadgets like these and I don't generally ask for help unless I've exhausted everything I could think of which is typically way beyond first level support.  The first responses to my query were to be expected:  Check your settings, reboot, reset to defaults, etc.  Eventually they did find the problem but it was not what I wanted to hear.  The problem turned out to be due to having the recording quality set to D1 as opposed to CIF.One reason I chose this model is because it can record in full D1 resolution, but unfortunately this apparently \"breaks\" the motion detection option which causes it to record all the time.  The problem with that is 1) It makes it much harder to spot \"events\" when reviewing recorded footage, 2) It wastes considerably more HDD space resulting in previous recordings getting overwritten much sooner than they needed to be and 3) IMO, more wear and tear on the HDD.When I told them that I wanted D1 resolution *and* motion recording, they said that they can only forward my findings to their programmers and *if* they can reproduce it (and *if* they can fix it), then they will release a firmware update.  While I wouldn't expect it this soon, for those interested, it is 3/18/2013 so any firmware update that may fix it would be released after this date.So overall I like the system but for now I am stuck recording at a lower resolution than I would like only because motion recording doesn't work at full D1.Hopefully they will fix it with an update soon.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Superb Surveillance System", "Author": "DesertDeuces", "ReviewID": "R1FNZA6WXUZDRM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third surveillance system.  My first was a Q-See 8 channel with 4 cameras.  It works fabulously.  The second system I bought was a Swann, and compared to the Q-See, it doesn't measure up.  So, needing a third system for the property I manage, I am getting another Q-See.Q-See DVR is top quality.  It's very easy to record, search for events, and backup just specific sections of a recording to a flash drive.I was pleasantly surprised to see that this system's DVR has some features that I hadn't even thought about before I bought it.  In addition to the usual BNC to RCA cable, the ethernet port and cable, vga port and 2 usb ports, it also has HDMI output plus an HDMI cable, and an ESATA port for connecting an external SATA HDD.Also, the indicator lights on the front are a pleasant pale green, which is so much better than that glaringly bright blue that DVRs normally have.  This makes a big difference to me since I keep one system in my bedroom.  Normally, I cover the front lights with tape, but with this one I don't have to.Fortunately I had a camera scanning the entrance to our community and was able to catch a man breaking and entering a truck parked near the entrance.  The tenant hadn't locked his truck so the thief was able to grab the tenant's stereo system from the truck and run.  Luckily, I was able to show the police the entire event on camera and handed the officer the recording on a flash drive.  The theft occured just after dusk, so the infrared night vision was on, and still, the quality was good enough for the police to identify the thief.Here's a tip I'd like to pass along:We have a large property with 4 separate buildings.  I'd been struggling to figure out how to run cable to put up cameras all over the property.  I even contacted ADT to get an estimate.  It was astounding what they wanted to charge!!! Over $20,000.00 to put up just 6 cameras and monitor them!!  GEEZ!I finally realized that all I need to do is to set up separate systems in each building's utility closet, drill 1 hole in the wall to run the cables to the roof and 'voila!' - DONE!  No trenches to dig, no long cables to run underground and under concrete sidewalks!!The reason this works is because I discovered that just about the only time I review the video is after the fact.  You can just about NEVER watch a crime in real time.  So, far better to have video surveillance everywhere and be able to provide the police with the recordings.In my opinion, Q-See is the best system around, and I'm sticking with this brand.  Customer service has been excellent, too.  I only needed to call them once for a little advice when I first started, then everything is really easy so I don't need to call anymore.UPDATE!!One big caution: I learned the hard way that the DVR is preset to motion sensor ON. This is the first CCTV DVR I ever purchased from Q-SEE that was set like this. I had thought that something was wrong with the hard drive, that it was not recording right.When I reviewed all of the settings, I found out about the motion sensor setting and realized why my recordings had blank spots. Once I set it to Motion Sensor OFF, everything is working fine.I don't like to use motion sensor. However, if you do prefer to use it, I still recommend that you check the settings and make sure they are set the way you like it. This system is very versatile, so you can do lots with it!", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointing and deceptively described.", "Author": "Michael Magee \"Just the facts, ma'am.\"", "ReviewID": "R2QFCCDEKQMEKO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First, the good points. The cameras and DVR were easy to install and set up. The eight included cameras allowed us to get excellent coverage of our 2800 square foot sales floor, and the DVR has a versatile set of programming options to customize when and how activity is recorded. If everything worked properly, this would be a good video surveillance option for small businesses.Our unit seemed to work properly out of the box. We were able to monitor and record activity in the store and log in remotely to view the camera feeds. Within three days of initial setup, we began to notice some of the same problems other reviewers have reported. Our unit will only record reliably when in continuous record mode. If the unit is set to record only when motion is detected, it will randomly change to continuous record, back to motion detection (\"alarm mode\"), and sometimes it won't record at all, even when there is motion. Q-See's tech support admitted there was a firmware problem with motion detection in D1 mode and suggested we record at lower resolution. One of the reasons we selected this product was its ability to record in D1, so this was disappointing, but we set it to CIF resolution as instructed. Unfortunately, this did not correct the problem. Our DVR will only record reliably if it is set to continuously record, which fills the hard drive much more quickly and makes it difficult to review video if an incident records. Motion detection mode simply does not work properly.Q-See's overseas tech support seems eager to help, but they have not been able to correct the problem and have dismissed my suggestion that the unit is defective. The system works, so I'm giving it a second star, but not as advertised in the product description here and on Q-See's website.

Have been working with tech support for weeks on this to no avail. They even sent me another unit and it did exactly the same thing. Obviously a flaw in the DVR or firmware. Latest firmware does not fix the problem. If you are looking at this system specifically for the ability to do motion recording at full resolution in real time (30 fps), I would have to say look at a different company. If you can live with CIF resolution the system works fine, but that defeats paying the extra cost for real time D1.

Since my monitor has 3 different input jacks, I can Toggle between computer (DVI) and DVR (HDMI) by just pressing the button on my monitor.I like the small footprint of the DVR, it does not take up much room.POWER ON: Everything worked, I almost fell out of my chair.One design flaw, there is a screw head on the case of the DVR which prevents one of the BNC jacks from being able to push all of the way in.Now for remote viewing. Since limited documentation comes with the DVR, you have to search the Q-See web site and gather the pieces for your situation. Also, the instructions on the provided CD are more detailed than the quick start instructions in the Box. Fortunately I have played around with port forwarding and my FIOS router, so I had basic knowledge before I started. I would recommend setting up an account on the myQ-See.com so you will have a unique IP address to access your DVR.Be sure to port forward your LAN IP in your router so your myq.see account can access your router without a router password.I downloaded the Q-See QS View from the app store for my IPAD and the same app from the Android PLAY store for my phone. To view the cameras remotely, set up the devices in the QS View program using your q-see domain, Media port and port #, DVR user name and password. (Be sure to read and understand, if you type in an incorrect entry into the QS view setup, it probably will not work. Take your time to read, understand and do it correctly) If you are connected to the same router as your DVR, you have to use the LAN IP address instead of the myq-see address.  In the case of my IPAD, I set up a HOME and AWAY device name since the IP address's are different in each case. Both work good. Sometimes the phone is a little sluggish, what do you expect from Verizon????Follow up 3 weeks after review:I did have one service issue, I could not get the sensitivity to correctly put the system in alarm state when motion is detected. You can set the system up to record only when a camera detects motion. A great feature of this system is you have the ability block out areas of the screen not to pick up motion. I have a tree that blows in the wind, So I could mask that area with the overhanging tree branch and only pick up the ground area I was interested in.Q-sees customer service is very responsive and resolved my issue right away. The e-mail customer service system works great. It took a few e-mails, but they did not give up until the problem was resolved. They even followed up afterwards to insure all was working well. I would say Q-See has one of the best Customer Service Departments out there.I have also played with different settings and found what was optimal for my use. The remote viewing is flawless.

I attached GW50 WD 700 line cameras (sony effio chip).  Tons of features. I hooked it to my router with a cat5 for remote viewing.  This also makes it where you don't need a monitor and can put it anywhere because you can control all functions from the web.  Qsee has a free DDNS service.  You can create your own http address to log into your system from anywhere on the web so you don't need to mess with the IP addresses (free and took 2min to set up).  I had to call tech support today with a question.  I was on hold for about 15 seconds and the support person answered my question and sent a follow up email in case I had any other issues.  All of the software is on the motherboard separate the hard drive.  If you want to upgrade later or if it crashes you just put another hd in.

They did not return my call as promised, but after I complained in email they contacted me very quickly and I received a call from Brenden Welch. He fixed the problem very quickly by changing some settings on the router. I now have access remotely and locally on the browser.  I have to give Brenden a hand for his expertise, he really knew what he was doing.If you are planning to buy a camera system, this is the best price and the best you can get for the money in my opinion.  Eight 600 scan line cameras with great night vision, 1tb hd, and excellent tech support!  I would recommend this system to my friends.

I had some issues with the dvr constantly recording even when there was no motion being detected, causing the 1tb harddrive to fill up very quickly. The customer service was \"excellent\" and gave me the option of replacing the unit with a different model. They did not say they had had problems with this model in constant record, but I was leery of making any exchange to another model that did not look as good as the QS558. Buuuut the replacement dvr supported 16 cameras versus the 8 camera i currently had. The Graphic Utility Interface was the same as the QS558 but worked flawlessly in the Motion Detect Record only setup. I am in the business of Home Security Systems Sales and Service, and i immediately saw the cost savings of this system. The cameras are totally awesome, and worked GREAT in total darkness. To see the recorded events thru a cellphone is both very clear and accurate. In D1 mode the recorded scenes are clear both at night and day!! The system has been in service since November 2012 and has NOT messed up at all!! WE are VERY SATISFIED, and APPRECIATIVE of Q-See product and service.

Only thing that was weird,  was that 4 of the 8 cameras, in the same room and same light, were flick off/on and go black/white. I would only get the color back if I faced them directly at the window(more light) Wasn't sure if that was a problem or not so I contacted Q-see.  They said the cameras are OK, but I could send them back if I wanted. Seem to much at the time for the shipping back/forth and all that, So I decided to install them. At 1st they all worked great, but after a few months, I started noticing the Dvr would show continuous recording and I wouldn't get any trigger e-mails from some of the cameras, when motion was detected.  No after having the system for 9mths, I'm starting to have more issues, with 3 of the 8 cameras, doing the same thing. I have to reboot the systems every 2 days to stop the cameras from continuous. It seems like from 5:30p to 7am next morning the 3 cameras would lock in record mode, without detecting motion, then when the sun comes up around 7am, they would stop, and work normal until around 5:30pm. Any1 else have the same issues? We been back an forth with q-see, but it seems they only work M-F, and chat only on weekends. Hoping to get those cameras replaced at least b4 the yr is up.However, other than those issues, the system is cool. The different ways you can set up/snap shots sent to your phone/email or some1 just walking their dog is pretty amazing. When everything works that is!!!!.

The unit has been in service for about 6 months now. I have a few recommendations regarding the product however.1) Before you attempt to configure, upgrade to the latest firmware version ( ver. T20130112_26_T011226 at the time of this review.) QS558 firmware link: [...]2) If you plan to use the QS558's motion detection features. Configure each camera's recording profile (configure -> record -> resolution & quality settings) to the same resolution (D1 in my case) and Quality (best).  I found that by mixing the resolution and quality settings across the various cameras, the QS558 just continually recorded (an issue I'm seeing in other reviews.)Pros:InexpensiveIndividual sound inputs for all 8 channelsConfigure & playback via HDMI,VGA, or webReliable web and smart phone playbackCons:Due to the thickness of this unit Q-See placed the Sound inputs on the same row as video inputs (as opposed to the sound input being below the corresponding video input).  The space between channel one sound input and the channel one video input is far enough apart that for inexpensive cables that don't provide a wide split at the cables end the inputs are almost too wide.  They'll fit, but barely.

Fortunately this has never been necessary.Pros:  Extremely reliable; the GUI (user interface) is a B+ reasonable; and the pre-installed 1TB disk is a good deal.  I also give a B+ rating to the My-Q-See web site that enables you to view your cameras from any internet connection.  It is a little counter-intuitive that you cannot see your DVR over MyQsee from inside your router, but with some very proficient and quick technical chat help, I got it all figured out.Cons:  The User Interface is a little weird, such as the \"close\" button being on the lower right.  I would like to be able to search for changes (when did an object disappear).  Some of my cameras just will not configure to record on motion, not sure if this is the camera or the DVR.Overall, I'm pretty pleased with my two Q-See DVRs, they are far more reliable than the D-Link IP Camera/NVR string I also have monitoring my home.
