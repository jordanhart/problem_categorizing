{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good all around Outdoor IP Cam", "Author": "ExITPro", "ReviewID": "R1OZ24LDH552C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my camera directly from foscam.us, because apparently, that's the only way to get warranty service if you need it.I've spent many hours scouring the web, looking for a camera like this, only less expensive. Well, it appears that this camera is about as good as it gets for anything close to it's price. I've seen some people complain about it not having IR. It doesn't bother me in the least, since I'm pretty sure that IR LEDs mounted in there with the camera lens would tend to reflect on the inside of the dome, back to the camera.I installed it myself, a little over 2 weeks ago. I mounted it on a \"ARM Electronics SDOCA Outside Corner Adapter for Speed Dome Camera\". I ran 100 foot Cat6 cable to a PoE injector, and into a wireless \"n\" bridge. It runs flawlessly.This is kind of a side issue. But, I'll mention it here, just in case it can help somebody else. I ran into intermittent video problems, within a day of the install (which turned out to be NO fault of the camera). But, before I figured it out, it had me thinking I was going to have to send it back for repair. It turned out that (for whatever reason) I needed to clear my ARP tables. This is the table that equates IP addresses with MAC addresses. Routers, switches, Computers...etc maintain these tables for every device on a local area network. If something in a table gets out of whack, odd things can happen. So, I turned off everything on my local area network, then restarted everything (Router, then bridges, then switches, then computers). Problem solved, and video's been perfectly stable ever since.A tip: If you use Blue Iris Software with this camera, you'll need to delete the presets (1 - 10) in the Blue Iris configuration. and add presets: 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44. I don't understand why this is? Just do it.  :)Bottom line: I really like this camera. It's very fast moving from one preset to another. It auto focuses quickly. It has rock solid performance, even in sub freezing weather. I'm about to order another one for the rear of my house.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "good for certain aplications", "Author": "Chris Swiontek", "ReviewID": "R3F20H6BF9XL6K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "the good:  decent zoom {auto focus is hit or miss/but you can manually adjust it  daytime view is very clean {sharp image/high rez/and fast framrate}  GREAT mounting bracket {very solid and sturdy }the bad:  LEAKS LIKE A SIV! {but can easily be fixed with a little silicon around the mounting bracket,and where the dome attaches to the bracket}  NO INTERNAL HEATER! this ip camera WILL fog up at certain temperature changes! {but...if you seal it with silicon,its not too bad.

Most recently an FI9821W, an FI8910W, and this FI8620 for outdoor use.  I have been working as a Software Engineer and Network Administrator since the mid 1980's.  I know my way around a network and am very computer literate.  Consider this perspective when you read the rest of this review.Anyway, getting the camera set up and talking on the network was easy - no problems there.  However, I am completely UNABLE to get this camera to work properly with ANY browser in my Windows environment.  As a computer specialist, I have Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome all loaded on my PC.  I can obtain an initial connection to the device with any of these just fine, but once I try to log in I can never get any video stream to display at all!  ...regardless of which browser I try.  (You actually have to log in TWICE)  The control screen is there but I can never get a proper video stream.  IE presents a \"Login Fail\" on the video screen (and I did install the ActiveX plugin they require).  Firefox and Chrome both present a \"negotiating\" message from the quicktime plugin which goes on forever.  I did not have any such problems with the 9821 and 8910 cameras but this 860 is pure crap.  I think the hardware build is fine, but the software is absolutely brain dead.  I am running Win8 (64 bit) but I have also tried getting a video stream from an XP computer (32 bit) in our office without success.  I have done lots of internet research and found a note saying that the TCP service port should be changed (which I did) but it did not help.  I also read that the software does not like 64 bit environments so I tried 32 bit Windows XP (which did not help).  I also tried disabling my AntiVirus software and that also was not useful.  I tried calling Tech Support, waited 20 minutes, gave the \"offshore\" support guy a brief description of my problem and then was mysteriously disconnected.So now I've dialed back in and am waiting again.  I'm writing this review as I wait.  That's what I do in these types of situations.  If they think that disconnecting a call will make me give up, they are wrong.  I will try again, and then spend the extra time making sure other potential customers know about the issue...So completely no luck with any browser connections what-so-ever...I have also tried this camera with the Blue Iris software which seems to work except that the video image is running at the wrong resolution and it keeps resetting each time I try to change it.  Blue Iris also has no ability to focus the camera.I also tried the Foscam CMS (Camera Management System) and it also appears to display at the wrong resolution and likewise provides no ability to focus the camera.I have tried downloading and updating the camera with the latest firmware.  (I think the firmware downloadable from their web site is actually OLDER than what was originally installed on the camera - but the original stuff wasn't working anyway...)For a camera costing more than $400 this is absolutely crap.  In fact, I have basically 0 functionality so its junk at any price.  The other, cheaper, Foscam cameras seemed OK, but this one is going back ASAP!BEWARE!", "Date": "April 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor customer support", "Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "R47O0K593MZBW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had purchased this FI8620 camera from Foscam.us directly to get the extended warranty.Very quick shipment!  I placed the order on a Friday, and received it on a Monday.While unpacking the fully assembled camera/dome I noticed that the camera was wobbly inside the housing.When I plugged it in, it made horrible grinding noises.  I could get video from the camera, but it would not pan left or right.  The tilt up/down, and focusing worked perfectly.I called support, and they wanted to know how often the camera acts up.  I informed them it was new, and I've been trying to get it to work for the last 1/2 hour.  Long story short, they were to focused on reading a script of powering off/on, resetting, wanting to load the same firmware thats already on the camera.... They didn't want to listen to what I was trying to explain.  The camera had a manufacturing defect.I am returning this, plus the other two models I purchased at the same time as a result of horrible customer service.", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good on the phone", "Author": "Chalres Crowe", "ReviewID": "R3GBFMY3Q4YDB1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We spend a lot of time tying to figure out how to make this work and our questions were quickly answered when we called.

You can adjust how fast it moves in the web UI. PTZ works good, this was my first ip camera with zoom and I was impressed.I'm only giving it 3 stars because there is no nightvision. For the price they are asking it really should. There are other cameras for less money that do.Installation was pretty straight forward. I used a netgear POE switch and Trendnet POE device to run power so cabling was a snap. As mentioned earlier the thing is solid, it's not super heavy but was fun on a ladder trying to mount it on the side of the house.If you tend to leave outside lights on where this will be mounted or if the lights have a motion sensor this camera may work well for you.
