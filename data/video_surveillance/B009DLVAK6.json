{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Another DVR to fool buyers", "Author": "BWare", "ReviewID": "R3ETXKR9HT2JBK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this after having tried several problematic DVR brands advertised here in Amazon, all returned for a similar problem. The main reason I chose this unit, was the brand name Swann thinking it would have better quality than the other ones. I was completely mistaken, in fact this unit is as bad as the other ones; it seems all these cheap DVRs all made from the same Chinese manufacturer(s). The software menus are similar if not the same among several brands, and the problem is the same as before: The unit freezes after some time of recording videos with motion detection turned on. The \"fix\" is the same: Reboot the DVR. I didn't notice this one had the same problem until it was too late to get a refund; instead, I contacted Swann hoping that they would have answers. They sent me another unit which froze after just 1 week of running. The lesson is to stay away from these cheap DVRs that do not operate consistently; I will contact Swann again to see which is their story now. Update to follow soon.", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$199.99", "Features": "Swann RedAlert 2 Movement Video Recorder", "Name": "Swann RedAlert 2 Movement Video Recorder", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21WZFAFJM9L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009DLVAK6"}}
