Pierce \"Disrputive Thinker\"", "ReviewID": "R29S8YPGNPE31Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to use as a cheep wireless IP webcam.  It offers the ability to hook into your network either with the wireless WSP functionality or with an ethernet connection.  It is fairly small with the camera being about the size of an iphone (maybe about 80% that size). The base allows for you to mount it in multiple settings, but be clear, this is a very simple design...not rocket science by any means.  The ac power cord is about 4 feet long.Setup: I ran into an issue when I was trying to set up the wireless connection.  I could not get my camera and wireless router to talk at all.  I called tech support (the free version) and they were useless.  The rep had no clue about the specific devise and it is clear that he was just in a large call center that probably supports dozens if not hundreds of products.  I had NO problem when I hooked it into my network via an ethernet cable.  The set up application runs very nicely and easily gives you the option to select either wireless or wired set up as needed.Back to my wireless problem.  I decided that I would pay $32 for D-Links premium support for 30 minutes of help...I rolled the dice, as they do not guarantee they will fix your problem for your investment, but I had a feeling my issue was something simple with my network configuration...and I was right.  The rep was great, she remoted into my pc, checked out my wireless settings on my router and determined that I had a bad character in my site name.  None of my other wireless products had a problem with the character, but the D-Link cam did not like it.  She changed the name of my wireless network, we restarted the router,and instantly the camera linked in wirelessly.I am absolutely convinced that if I had not had a dash in my wireless network name, then this wireless set up would have been a breeze.  So, I can't place blame for this issue on D-Link, but it was interesting that no other wireless device I use had a problem with the naming convention of the network.Once that hurdle was cleared, it has been smooth sailing.  I really like the ease of use and the functionality included with the set up...through a web interface, you can control video size, audio (yes it has a mic and sends the audio over IP in realtime), you can set motion detection, auto emailing on detection, and it even has a built in ftp server to send the images where ever you like.Simple camera that does exactly what it says...it provides decent video and audio wirelessly to your network and then you can do with it what you want.Pros: Simple, straight forward, nice setup application used on your pc, D-Link offers free remote viewing via their web portal MyD-link, and they also offer a free iPhone app (no audio on the iPhone app).Cons: Seems somewhat fragile...I would not want to drop it form more than a foot off the ground.  A fall from any higher seems would shatter it.Overall I think this is a really good value.((Update Dec. 18, 2011)So I have had this camera in service for over a year now...and it has been installed outside, under an eave of my house.  It has no additional protection from the elements...just its own casing and the few inches of cover provided by the eave.  It has been subjected to all the weather Atlanta receives in a year...heat 95+, cold 9, wind, rain, humidity, etc. The verdict...GREAT..not one issue with it.  So, I just purchased three more for outdoor viewing around the house.  I put one into service yesterday and had NO problems with setup at all.  Used the auto network connect feature on the camera and my Netgear router and it hooked in within a minute.  Great little camera and with the price dropped to $70, I think it will be hard to beat it.", "Date": "December 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Home security made simple", "Author": "Ammy_Evaluator", "ReviewID": "R3PIEMA7W74CPI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a review for the DLink DCS-930L Day camera - NOT the low light version (DCS-932L).Updated 8/18/2013: Edited to add detailed setup instructions.Original Review:##########This is the easiest way I found to monitor our home remotely.I was pleasantly surprised with how quickly everything came together - I had the camera installed and transmitting in less than 15 minutes. I plugged the camera into a power outlet, popped the CD in (on a Windows 7 64-bit computer), entered my wireless network credentials, set up a DLink account from which to monitor the camera, and presto!What works well:###########1. The lens is reasonably wide angle - it can cover most of a normal size room.2. It has audio! And it works very well.3. Image quality is decent - you can recognize people, but it isn't broadcast quality by any means.4. Moving the camera kills the feed for a couple of minutes, but it's back on the network in less than 2 minutes.5. The iPhone app is cool! We were able to watch the camera just as well on an iPod Touch. As another reviewer suggested, Tiny Cam (the free version is sufficient) worked great for me on Android.6. The admin interface for the camera is stellar. You can control the refresh rate and resolution of the camera; the saturation, brightness, and contrast of the image; and the volume for the audio. You can even turn off the annoying LED light on the front of the unit!7. Setting up motion detection is also really easy. You just pick the sensitivity of detection, and click on parts of the frame where you want detection to trigger. That's it! When motion is detected, you can ask the camera to email you the images.8. Setting up email notification is simple too. I looked up the SMTP address and port for Yahoo, entered my email address and password, and was soon receiving emails from my camera!9. It connects via Wireless-N and has an awesome range. It connects without problems to my router from across the house, through multiple walls.10. This device supports WPS. What this means that you can automatically configure it to access your router, with just a couple of button presses. (However, due to security issues with WPS, I recommend that you turn off WPS on your router.)What doesn't:##########1. The camera does not work in low light conditions as it does not have infrared capabilities. You need at least a 40W lamp for it to be functional. This tends to be a bit annoying for me, as the camera becomes fairly useless once evening falls. The infrared-capable DCS-932L may be a better choice in this regard.2. No pan/tilt options on this camera. For me, this is not as big a deal as the low light issue, especially given its wide angle of view.3. The camera feels a bit delicate, but should hold up well given that it isn't going to be handled much. It did take a couple of falls and has survived. (Updated 8.18.13: My camera's stand has since broken. Thank goodness for duct tape.)4. The camera needs to be plugged into an electrical outlet. Its short power cord does limit the locations where it can be placed.Conclusions:########Overall, this was plug and play installation at its best.I also can't believe there is a simpler way to get all of this functionality in a single unit. This device is extensively customizable. I was particularly impressed that the designers had thought about putting in a way to turn off the blinking LED in the front of the camera. This LED is a very useful diagnostic tool (it flashes amber when it is setting itself up, and green when it is broadcasting), but it drove me nuts, until I found this option in the admin panel.Hope this helps.Happy Monitoring!Continue reading if you want to setup your camera manually. While this is more involved, it also means you need not install any additional software. However, you do lose the ability to record video.Updated Aug 18, 2013: Manual Setup################################Before you begin, remember that you only have one publicly visible IP address - and this is allocated by your ISP, and is assigned to your router. Inside your network, your devices are allocated private IP addresses, in the range 192.168.x.y. These addresses are termed \"private\" because they only make sense within your own internal private network.A computer outside your network only recognizes the public IP address of your router. It has no idea how many devices you might have on your internal network.So how do you access your camera from outside your home network?The answer is to use port forwarding to uniquely identify one of your internal devices, and make it addressable over the Internet. You do this by reserving a particular port (say, 90), and telling your router that any attempt to access that particular port on the router's public IP address, should actually be sent directly to the internal device (this camera) identified by a given private address (say, 192.168.1.5).You will need to add a new port forwarding rule to your router for each camera that you need to expose externally.Setup the camera############1. Connect the camera to your router with an Ethernet cable2. Login to your router, and note the camera's internal IP address (Attached Devices page)3. Navigate to that IP address in a browser to access the camera's web server4. Login to the camera as \"admin\" with a blank password (default)5. Verify that you can watch the camera's video6. In the camera's interface:....Setup tab > Wireless Setup menu > Wireless Settings section: check Enable; set SSID; Security Mode and your network key....Maintenance tab > Admin menu > Admin Password Setting: set a new password (important!)....Maintenance tab > Admin menu > Server Setting section: LED Control=Off7. Disconnect the Ethernet cable. You should now connect wirelessly.Setup the router#############1. Add a DHCP Address Reservation for the camera's internal IP address.That way each time your camera connects to your router, it will always get the same IP address.2. Add a Port Forwarding Rule:Use Service type=TCP/UDP. External start/end port=90. Internal start/end port=80. Internal IP address=your camera's reserved address.To verify your port forwarding rule works, use the external IP address (shown on your router's status page) and forwarded port, e.g., of the form http : // a.b.c.d:90 (remove spaces). When a request comes in to your router at port 90, it will now forward it directly on to port 80 at your camera's IP address.That's it!Advanced Manual Setup:################Here are a few advanced options for using this camera.Dynamic DNS:##########If your IP address changes frequently, or are tired of remembering numeric addresses, register at a dynamic DNS provider, such as dyndns.org. My router, a WNDR4500, actually keeps dyndns informed whenever my public IP address changes. I can now use a text-based domain name and it will be automatically converted of my IP address.Setup Email##########Your camera can automatically send you emails. To do that, it needs to know information about your email provider as well as your username/password credentials. The steps below are for gmail, but you can look up the equivalents for other email providers.(also see Abhilash's notes in the comments below)Setup tab > Mail menu....SMTP Server Address: smtp.gmail.com....SMTP Server port: 465....Sender email address: your sending email address at gmail....Receiver email address: the email that should receive sent emails....User name: the part of your sending email address before the @gmail.com....Password: your email password....Use SSL-TLSClick the Test Email Account.Verify the status of the test, at Status > Device Info > E-mail Test.Motion detection:#############You can have the camera email you either on a schedule or if motion is detected in a configurable hot zone.Setup > Motion Detection....Motion Detection: Enable....Detection Area: click the squares of interestSetup > Mail....select \"Enable emailing images to email\"....select \"Motion Detection\"Finally, we're done :)Good luck!", "Date": "February 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wireless IP Camera", "Author": "Javan W. Rasnake \"Outdoorsman\"", "ReviewID": "R1FNC9JYEKWZN3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "OK, so I was a little apprehensive about buying this camera as the reviews are mixed.  I have only had the camera a few days so these are initial impressions, I will provide some updates as time goes on.  Here are initial impressions:Set-up:Set up is simple.  I run a wireless home network with an old cisco-linksys wireless router and several wireless devices including several Apple Macintosh products and a Playstation 3.  I was concerned at first because the \"zero configuration setup\" was shown to be only for d-link routers.  For all other routers, you are directed to the d-link website to download a configuration wizard.  You download either for mac or windows as appropriate.  The mac wizard was very simple.  From opening the box to looking at live video stream on my MacBook was about 15-20 minutes.Basically, the wizard has you plug the camera into your router via the included ethernet cable.  Then you plug in the power, wait for the camera to detect your network (via the wizard), log the camera into your network via the wizard, and you are pretty much done.  You unplug the ethernet and have a working wireless IP camera.IF you have a d-link router there is a \"zero-configuration\" option that I guess is easier.  However, with the wizard it was very easy with my linksys setup.  No port forwarding/dealing with IP adressing/etc is required to set up the camera.  I was actually surprised by how easy it was. So setup = 5 stars.Camera/device quality:Camera housing in constructed of questionable-quality white plastic.  The camera housing is attached to the base via a swivel assembly that allows a reasonable range of rotation (about 90 degrees in any direction).  The base of the camera is large enough it can sit on a flat surface, also, the base can be mounted to a wall with the two (included!) screws.Image quality:Good enough.  It's not HD or super-high framerate, but for a home monitoring camera of this price range, it's pretty darn good.  No complaints from me on that.The included IR is a nice touch.  It really helps at night.  In complete darkness, you can see nothing with the optical camera, but turn on the IR and you can see pets/kids/whatever you want pretty well.Software quality:This is where the real problems lie, and where really the only frustration in the process occurred for me. D-links camera management software is pretty terrible.  The website software I've only used a couple times (I use my Ipad, see below, to view the video feed) but seems pretty glitchy and wants to freeze up my computer.  Downloading the app for my ipad was very frustrating.  Here is an important note for ipad/iphone users:DON'T DOWNLOAD THE MYDLINK+ APP FOR IPAD/PHONE.  IT DOESN'T WORK. But for some reason d-link is keeping it on the app store at a price of a whopping 99 cents.  So save your money and buy a candy bar.  Because there is another app, the MY DLINK LITE app, that works just fine for me, and is free.  Now, it's not pretty, but it works.  So get the free one, and be happier.D-link doesn't seem to be supporting their apps well, which is surprising given the number of horrid reviews on the app store.OK, so that's pretty much it for now.  Updates to come regarding the longevity of the camera, etc.  Thanks for reading!*******UPDATEAfter a few months of ownership, it seems this is a rather reliable camera.  I've had no trouble with it yet, it works as advertised.  When I am around the home, I don't use it, to save power.  When I leave, I plug it in, and it has no problems connecting to my wireless network.  Still works great!*******SECOND UPDATEStill awesome.  Works great.  Only other thing to post is some loser advertiser posted in my comments about a pay web service to host your web stream.  DON'T PAY FOR THAT.  You don't need to.  That's one of the great things about this D-Link camera, that service is free, through D-Link.  So although the app may not be the best thing ever, it's OK, and your certainly don't need to pay for a webcam service to use your D-Link camera, so please ignore that comment.  Thanks!", "Date": "June 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great IP Cam if you have networking IQ", "Author": "Richard Malarky", "ReviewID": "R2VN59IUXZBXWB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm really digging this camera. If you have some basic networking chops then setup is a breeze and can easily be done on any operating system with a web browser without using the CD. Here's what you need to do.1) Plug the IP Cam directly into your router with an ethernet cord (there should be one provided in the box).2) Plug the power cord into your camera. =D3) From a web browser, log into your router and find the IP address of the camera. Finding the IP address is probably the hardest step. On my D-Link router the IP address can be found in the Setup -> Network Settings tab.4) From another browser window, enter the IP address of your camera. If you successfully entered the right IP address then you should see a login window. The default username is \"admin\" and the password should be left empty.5) Now you are at the setup page and you can add your wireless router and modify various settings.Here are a few extra steps that I highly recommend.- On your router, set up a DHCP Reservation to your IP camera or if your router doesn't have this feature then set up a static IP address on your camera.- Create a free dyndns.org account and set that up on your router, NOT directly on the camera.- Once you have dyndns setup on your router, set up a virtual server to forward a specific port to port 80 on your IP camera. (For instance yourname.dyndns.org:4444 will point to your ISP's DHCP IP address and then forward port 2000 directly to port 80 on your IP camera. This allows you to see your camera from any browser on any internet connected computer.)- If you have an android phone, install Tiny Cam from the Market and you should be able to see a live video feed on your mobile phone from anywhere you have wireless access.Setup was a very straightforward breeze for me. It took approximately 15 minutes to set everything the way I wanted it and I never touched the CD or instruction manual.For the price, the camera quality more than met my expectations. This is a perfect camera for me to monitor my dog on my phone or laptop while I'm away from home.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Deteriorating Wireless Strength", "Author": "Mike MG", "ReviewID": "R2R5J061FHELTC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased one of these cameras several months ago and it worked so well for the first month that I decided to get a second one.  I have now had both for about two months and am finding that my first camera's wireless connection has slowly gotten less and less reliable.  It had been in a fixed location the whole time with two walls and a floor between camera and wireless router (about 25 - 30 feet away).  Router settings have not changed.  I have performed extensive diagnostics, i.e. went through camera setup several times, changing router settings (removed all wireless security, used fixed IP) and nothing worked.  Reset button on camera did not help.  Firmware update did not help.I have finally found that the camera now only works within 15 feet or so of the router, and it must be on the same floor as the router with no walls in between.  This is unacceptable for a wireless camera, and my concern is that the wireless card within the camera is losing strength.  The other camera I own once worked outside of the house entirely and now will no longer work there nor in the location of the first camera (which is closer and less obstructed than being outside).  All other wireless devices we own have ample wireless signal throughout the house, our garage, and most of our yard, and as far as I can tell none of that has changed.As I am using an Airport Extreme router and thought that there might be some sort of compatibility issue I have even tried running the camera wireless through my old D-Link DIR-615 wireless router with a fully open wireless connection and have not had any luck...the signal range for the camera is the same.  DLink support has been no help, other than suggesting only using their routers (which didn't help) and rebooting everything and reconfiguring the camera (also did not help).I cannot recommend this camera to anyone due to this reliability issue.  It is fairly easy to set up and has a useful iPhone app available, but will likely be no use to anyone unless they can keep the camera within 15 feet of their access point with no obstructions in the long run.  All I can do is wait until I have the money to replace these cameras with something better.  Don't let this happen to you.  Start with a different camera first.", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Low price WebCam with good wireless range and motion detection.", "Author": "J. Sun", "ReviewID": "R1HFJB24N9DGAI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased four DCS-930L cameras to set up a DIY home surveillance system. Overall I am happy with what they can do with such a low price tag.The installation was easy. After opening the box, I connected cameras to my router with network cables. And after I inserted the CD into my computer, the auto-run program led me through the entire process step by step. The program had no problem finding the cameras, and registered them to mydlink.com.That was the only time I needed that CD-ROM. Any additional setup, such as wireless, video, audio, motion detection, email, or ftp, etc, could be performed via mydlink.com. I could change the settings from anywhere with internet connection. And unlike other products, mydlink.com is free. This is indeed terrific!Setting up the wireless for DCS-930L was not difficult either. If you have the experience of adding a few window-based PCs into your home wireless network, you will find the process to add DCS-930L is exactly the same. I entered the SID and the WEP password, disconnected the network cable from the cameras, and unplug/plug the power cord. In about 1 minute the cameras (now wireless) showed up on mydlink.com!The wireless range on this camera is very good. I think D-link really listened to their users, since there were lots of complaints on the poor wireless range of its previous version DCS-920. I have a big house with many rooms. In a few remote rooms with many walls in between even my itouch cannot find wireless signal. But DCS-930L can! And the connection is always stable. So far I have never lost any video feed yet. Without wireless connection concerns, I can put the cameras anywhere there is a power outlet. (Yes, DCS-930 does need a power line. So it is not completely wireless. But I could always find outlets close enough to plug my cameras in.)A new feature you cannot find in DCS-920 is the motion detection. Again, via mydlink, I turned on motion detection, adjusted the detection sensitivity, and then selected the areas in the view point to be on/off motion detection. The sensitivity and the areas depend on what the cameras point to and the lighting condition of the time. So it took me a few days to experiment different settings in morning/evening sun-light, etc.After that, I went to the email setup page and select \"motion detection\" so that emails will be triggered by the motion detection. I intend to use it when I am away from my house. Again, DCS-930L has an enhancement over DCS-920: I can set up SSL emails so that my email password is always protected.The video quality is 640x480, which I believe is the same as the DCS-920. However, DCS-930 has an enhancement: Audio. I could hear the sound from the camera even when I clap my hand in a different room! Of course the quality of both video and audio is no where near HD. But given the low price tag, I have no complaints.The only major issue I can think of is the lack of the night vision. Without it the camera can hardly see anything during the night, and the entire surveillance system is therefore useless. (However, no camera in this price range has night vision, at least I could not find one.)Overall I am very happy with the camera. And I will not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Easy Set-up for Windows and Apple Systems - There's an Issue, though", "Author": "George McAdams", "ReviewID": "RLZB5YPEIDNI6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The D-Link DCS-933L  is the third Internet camera system, not including webcams, that I have set-up, and I found this one the easiest to establish a connection that works. I will try to make this review quick and easy, but there are two things, with one being a big issue if you want to view what your camera sees on your computer, you aren't made aware of until you are almost finished:1)  If you use either Windows or Apple Operating Systems, I recommend before you connect your cameras, you go to [...] and establish your D-Link account.  Leave you connection active when you begin you install.  By doing this, when you run your installation software, you will go into the D-link site.2)  If you anticipate you will be wanting to view your camera with your computer, you will need to have Flash on your Windows computer and Java for Apple.  This leads to some confusion because for both Apple and Windows set-ups, it says it likes to use the latest Flash.  Unfortunately, Apple has an aversion to Flash, but Apple, if you look deep enough into their support pages you will find they have worked-up their version of Java, build SE 6, for \"special edition 6.  Unfortunately, Apple has not updated SE 6 as they should have and there are some security issues.  In doing my Apple installation, the first time, it mistakingly told me I needed a certain version of Java and it automatically sent me somewhere and I downloaded version 7.  Unfortunately, it did not tell me I needed to remove Apple's Java SE 6.  Later, I came across instructions on how to check what I needed to do.  In my various Apple installations I have had smooth ones and a couple of bumpy ones.  Go to support.apple.com/kb/DL1572 and you will receive instructions on how to remove SE 6 and install an Apple update.  If that doesn't work, and I had that happen once, go to your search engine, and search for \"remove java se 6 mac.\"  You will find Apple and Oracle instructions detailing what you need to do.  Just remember, you will have to removed the SE 6 Java patch first.  Oh, and this is a big \"Oh,\" the Java patch will work only with Safari and Firefox, but it will not work with Chrome. On Apple Operating Systems, if you haven't installed Java before, you will probably just need to remove SE 6.  With Windows, Java 7 seemed to overwrite previous versions.That said and done, installation is a breeze.  First put your DCS-933L near where you can have an Ethernet hook-up and a power receptacle for your camera's power adapter.  Go to the web site [...] click on the picture of the DCS-933-L (see uploaded picture), and click on the link to download your installation software.  I like how with the Windows software they have the software in a zip file and as an executable file, it shows some forethought by the company.The software installation for recognition of your camera is fairly straight forward. First you attach the short CAT5 cable (included with your camera) to your LAN's modem.  Then, you power-up the camera by attaching the plugged-in power adapter's cable.  If your home has several WiFi LANs as mine does, you will need to make sure you use the core LAN, not the ones you have piggybacked on your system. Once you have established your connection with your WiFi or your LAN (you are given a choice of hardwired or wireless, and with the wireless you can use the WPA buttons on your camera and wireless modem to establish a connection), you can then disconnect the CAT5 if you've established a WiFi connection.Then, you'll go to the mydlink.com site and your camera is registered.  With regards to iPhone apps, you will notice three D-Link apps, the \"My DLink Lite\" is the one that will connect with your camera(s)  The view from your phone app is nice (I'll post a picture as soon as I can).  It allows you to bring-up and reduce the volume, and unlike some of the other cameras I have used, it has exceptional hearing qualities.  You can hear a pin drop on the floor from across the room, so if you're viewing a camera in your house on your home computer, beware of feedback.  All-in-all, a pretty good camera.  The infrared lights aren't too bright at night, but you want to make sure if you have more than one camera at night to make sure a second camera doesn't see the \"white\" light of the first camera.Reconnecting your camera after moving the camera within your WiFi area is easy.All-in-all, a good set-up.  The company looks like it has done plenty of forethought.  I just wish the Flash issues wasn't so much an Apple issue.", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Setup wizard din't work.

So, rather than bore you with another review of the 932, when there are already 793 customer reviews for it on Amazon... I'm going to focus on the DIFFERENCE between the 932 and the 933.... other than the $20 bump in price.First, some useful links:DCS-932L - D Link Wireless Surveillance mydlink Enabled DCS 932LDCS-933L manufacture page - [...]Product Manual - [...]  (make sure and see page 26 for wifi-extension information)The differences:- Slightly different base. I own both the 932 and the 933 and although the bases look different... I would say neither is functionally or aesthetically superior. Its a draw, and a non-factor.- 933 includes a \"wifi extender\" feature that acts as a repeater for your EXISTING wifi network. By the very nature of being a repeater, the bandwidth will be HALF. Half of the bandwidth is consumed by you to the camera, and half of the bandwidth is used to 'repeat' your signal to your existing Access Point / Router. The real payoff is that, depending on placement of the camera, your wifi network will cover more square footage. Also worthy of mention is that you can re-use an existing SSID... making real-world use much more enjoyable. Gone are the days of having multiple SSIDs in a single dwelling, as all the current drop of dlink routers/ap's include this ability. This was not true with the previous generation (see dlink dap-1522, as an example). Of course, you also have the option of creating a new SSID, if you so choose.Feel free to ask questions as comments to this review.", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works great...now Mac-native installer!", "Author": "Mike Carter \"PilotMike\"", "ReviewID": "R1N6NHD66SQGHD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was a little apprehensive at first when I saw this at Fry's and looked up the reviews.

In under 2 minutes, I was seeing myself through the camera using the DLink website!Shortly afterwards, I grabbed the iPhone app and logged in to find my camera available and ready to go!Getting the camera on my Aiport Extreme was very easy as well.

With two dogs alone in the house I was hoping to watch them and be sure that my home is safe.Pros: It works.  Although it functions at a low quality of video and sound, you can see whatever it is that you want to see.  I can watch my dogs wander or see that my front door is securely shut with my valuables in place.  Only once has the camera refused to load on my iPhone app but other than that it has worked flawlessly.  Setup is easy as long as you follow the directions and it's extremely simple once it's setup.  I unplug it when I'm home and when I plug it in to leave it picks right back up without having any network connection issues.  The iPhone app is free and extremely handy to use (MyDLink app).  You can save your login and view your camera with only one click after opening the app.  You can also have multiple cameras on your account in different places.Cons: While the camera functions well, the video quality is low.  The image is pixilated - but what do you expect for a $60 wireless camera?  The sound is also lacking.  Even when I am viewing the camera on a network and not using my iPhone's 3G the sound cuts in and out with white noise.  The video lags as well but at least this camera functions 99% of the time.Overall: For light indoor monitoring this camera is great - if you need to hear a conversation or every little noise and see every detail, then this is not the camera for you.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, works great!!!", "Author": "FordFasteRR", "ReviewID": "R2X9EH9HEXL5UZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have installed 15 of these cameras.

Ewing", "ReviewID": "R2D2K8U0SRQW6X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is an Amazon Vines review of the D-Link DCS-933L D-Link Wireless N Day/Night Home Network Camera with a built-in 300mbps wireless repeater. The product arrived timely and was well packaged.The DCS-933L comes with a built-in CPU and web server and offers simple installation and an intuitive web-based interface for camera control and setup. You can also use this program to integrate the camera into your home network. It took me about 20 minutes from start to finish to set up and have this camera running. It also comes with a built-in 300Mbps wireless repeater.The D-Link DCS-933L supports either wired or WiFi 802.11n connectivity and has Wi-Fi Protected Setup. I set my camera up using Wireless N and placed it about 65 feet and one floor, and three walls away from my wireless access point. Using the built-in wireless repeater, I am able to connect the camera to my Wi-Fi access point and the camera can maintain a steady connection with fairly steady throughput for the streaming video. So I think the repeater does do its job and will push the signal further when you place the camera a fair distance from your Wi-Fi access point or router.The DCS-933L offers 3 different color video resolutions and includes infrared technology that lets you monitor a home or small office at about 15 feet away from the camera at low light settings. When the infrared is in use, the image turns to black and white.  Of course the video becomes more difficult to make out when using infrared, but the quality is not bad.You can view the video via a web browser using a myDlink web page that you set up with your login and password or you can view the video via the myDlink Lite app for your iPhone, iPod, iPad, and Android. I have viewed the camera video via Firefox and Internet Explorer browsers and have used the myDlink Lite app to view the video on my iPod. I basically have been pleased with the video quality when viewed either from a browser or on the iPod. Although the camera comes with auto white balance, I have been very disappointed with how the video washes out when sunlight is shinning into my sun room, which is where I set up the camera. I would have thought the camera would have done a better job of adjusting the video to compensate for the sunlight. I have read that the white balance for this camera is only set for use in interior rooms and so this would explain why it has a lot of trouble balancing the light in a room with several windows.One nice feature I do like about the camera is that I can record video directly to my Network Attached Storage (NAS) device, which eliminates my need to have a dedicated computer to store video. To set up this feature, you have to load and use the D-ViewCam software contained on the set up CD. This software is not all that user friendly, but with a little effort, you can figure it out and set up NAS storage, monitoring schedules, and other security related features for the camera.The camera also comes with a built-in microphone; and here is where the camera fails - miserably. There is a constant static to the audio no matter how you try to adjust it. Thia is a known issue with this camera. The audio static was so annoying that I finally just shut off the audio feature. This issue with the camera and the fact that Dlink seems in no rush to fix the issue is a huge disappointment with both the camera and the company.All in all, the DCS-933L camera is a decent video camera, and has decent functionality and usability. But with the camera's terrible audio issue and its poor ability to compensate for normal sunlight, I have to rate this camera just 3 stars.

Not great and the frames/second could be a bit more, but still usable.  That, however, is all I the good I have to say about this camera.  After playing around with it and upgrading the firmware, I have decided to purchase a different camera for the remainder of my setup at home.Here are the issues I have chosen as the most disappointing to me:1.  The wireless antenna range is just not that good. I have two access points at either side of my home providing complete coverage.  Every other wireless device and camera in the household is able to attach to the APs and obtain IP addresses.  This camera needs to be within 20-30 feet of an AP to work. I have a two year old smart phone and an ancient PDA that do better.2.  The audio is horrible.  Doesn't matter what browser/device I use to watch the stream.3.  And most importantly to me - there is no ability to set the camera up via its integrated firmware menu to do motion detection on a scheduled basis.In the setup menu I can set up a schedule where pictures are taken at regular intervals during specific times of the day. OR I can set up motion detection to snap pictures and send them out whenever motion is detected.  BUT I cannot have motion detection on a schedule at certain times of the day.  Why is this bad?  Because when motion detection is on, it is ON all the time. Including when I may be at home moving around in front of the camera.  And when it detects motion, it takes A LOT of pictures.  If the camera is set up to email the pictures somewhere offsite, the traffic can flood the network or spam an email account offline. In my opinion a good wireless camera should include a scheduled motion detection feature that can be enabled WITHIN its integrated firmware menu.For these reasons I give this webcam an overall rating of 1 star.  I'm not sure at this point if I can send it back since I have had it so long.  I'll try.  If not, then it will remain a \"nanny cam\" until such a time that D-Link sees fit to add the functionality for scheduled motion detection.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "could not connect to wireless network", "Author": "M.

Morris", "ReviewID": "RYLJOAH7RTWCN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First, it's possible that maybe I just got a dud. However, from reading other reviews, it seems I'm not alone. I could replace this camera with another, but instead, I'll get a refund and search for another model. Still, the features I could see looked nice, even if they weren't able to actually work. Here are some problems I faced. * After being on for a few minutes, the camera would lose network connectivity, forcing me to restart it (by unplugging the power) to make it usable again. I'm not sure if this depends on what type of scene it is aimed at or not, but it definitely wasn't going to work for me.* The device was never able to find my wireless network--or any others, for that matter. I had to use the wired connection. This was not a configuration issue on either end. Even after a reset and making sure my network was in the 2.4 GHz bands of 802.11n (and b/g), this camera could not find it--or any of my neighbors' that my computer can also see. My SSID contained only letters, no spaces or symbols.The above made it pretty useless for me. However, here are a few good things about it that I was able to discover:* You do not need to use D-Link's software to set up or manage the camera. There is a Web interface. You'll just need to find the camera's IP address and view it in a Web browser (you can do the same with most network printers, for example). If you don't know how to do this, however, you might be better just using their software. The one on the CD only works with Windows. Some of their cameras have Mac versions available on their website; I didn't care enough to look since you don't need it.* You don't *have* to use D-Link's cloud/MyD-Link service. However, again, if you're not comfortable setting up your own alternative, you might want to. What I did (with great difficulty given how finicky the camera was) was set up an FTP server on my home LAN for a file share I could access with a username and password I used just for this purpose. You can configure the camera to upload images via FTP. (You can also do e-mail if you provide SMTP server info.) I didn't want to expose this publicly, which is fine for the camera itself since it's also on my LAN. To view when I was away, I VPNed (via a separate service I configured) into my home LAN and then connected to the file share. Obviously, an off-site solution would be better, but this is the best I could do. And of course, the average person will not want to do this--but I just wanted to note that you don't *need* D-Link's offerings. You can save either on a timer (every 'x' seconds) or via motion detection. I was never able to get motion detection to work before the camera crashed.* For remote viewing of the camera live, I'd rather go via the previous method of images the camera saved (not quite live but close), but I could also use the camera's Web interface and view either a still image (refreshing as needed) or launch a Java applet that would give real-time video (and audio, though of questionable quality). Sometimes starting the Java applet crashed the camera, however, and made me reboot it.Besides the things i mentioned first, there are a couple more bad things:* As far as I can tell, the camera can't actually save video, only images. You can configure how many/how often, but this still caught me off guard that I could only get a folder full of JPEGs.* Reset button is very hard to press (paper clip was too big; I needed to use SIM card tool), and WPS button is very easy to press. I suspect most people won't need to reset as much as I did, and WPS wasn't a big deal for me because WiFi didn't work for me on it anyway (though I'd rather set it up manually in any case), but I did accidentally press it a few times.The camera itself is fairly lightweight, and the base should mount (bring your own adhesive or whatnot) to flat surfaces if you want. You can manually move the camera a bit on the stand, but there is no pan or tilt functionality in the software.This camera could at least be decent if it worked better--the feature set isn't bad, and the hardware, while light, feels good. Importantly, image quality was also good enough for security purposes as far as I was able to tell.

While D-Link may consider it a replacement, it is inferior in very important ways.First, it is significantly lighter; the construction is all light plastic (including the base) so it is not as stable sitting on a ledge/shelf - The hanging power cord can drag it and if you add an ethernet cable be prepared to secure the camera in place.Next, it is fixed focus.  You can manually adjust the focus on the 920.  With the 930 you get a fixed focus lens similar to the old 110 point-and-shoot cameras.Even with these limitations, I was able to find a use for it.

It is also easy to have to camera send its data to an FTP site.The range and video quality are both very good. The automated software and the mydlink website make it all simple to use. The camera stays connected to the network, and never stops broadcasting.The only task that isn't very easy to set up, is having the video go to a local hard drive.

Everything you would want a wireless camera for is very simple to set up. I am a complete novice with this setting network devices up, and had no problem.------- Update February 22nd, 2011 ---------I am still very happy with this camera. Since my initial review, I have continued to have very good experiences with it. Here are some more observations:- It reconnects to the network within 20 seconds, if you unplug it and move it to a new spot.- Though it works great over Android, they keep updating the software to make it more and more reliable. The camera always stayed connected to the net, but the phone would sometimes lose the connection. That is no longer a problem.- Also works on iOS products.- I have played with the Motion Detections settings in conjunction with FTP quite a bit recently. The camera is working great, and is highly adjustable in this regard, but the FTP service on my Linksys E3000 was giving me problems. Initially, I thought the camera wasn't working properly, or wasn't adjusting to my settings, but when I switched the FTP to an external site from my router, it is working fine. Either my E3000 isn't working right, or something with my network settings was causing it to intermittently disconnect. Either way, it isn't the camera's fault, because it is now working fine, connected to a remote FTP site. That is better than having it store the images in the house anyway.------ Update July 2011 --------This camera continues to perform very well and gives us a lot of peace of mind.

After a crash course in IP addresses, MAC's, SSID's, routers, WPS, and a lot of cursing and head slapping, I think I have my five camera home security system up and running.Initially bought three of the DCS-931L's, then accidentally bought two of the older DCS-930L's. They are for all intents and purposes the same in functionality, though I initially found the 931L's software easier to use. Stick with 931's.At first I had pretty good luck setting these cameras up with my old Buffalo Tech router. You hard wire them first, run the setup wizard (which you have to download as a zip file and is not real easy to get going), then you can WPS the cameras wirelessly. Move them and install anyplace. Range is surprisingly good.The MyDlink was ok to work with. This is the online portal to your cameras. The smartphone app counterpart was pretty good at sending me notifications of movement--at first. Then, suddenly, I started losing feeds from the cameras.  Pretty soon every one was dead. Must have uninstalled and reinstalled them a dozen times. And then I lost home WIFI. So, I assumed it was a bad router.  What luck.  So, I ordered a D-Link 855 model, more than anything because of \"zero configuration\" with their cameras.Installed the new router and everything seemed fine.  Then the same thing started happening. I could wirelessly configure the cameras straight from the router, but the IP addresses of the cameras were being assigned to other devices, and this caused all sorts of problems.  I kept uninstalling and reinstalling, trying to reserve IP addresses in the router...  Then I'd get them working only to find them slowly dropping out again. It seems to help to reserve the IP addresses of your other devices first, then install the cameras.I finally came to the conclusion that the way to install them is first to wirelessly WPS them from the router to the camera. Then I'd go into D-ViewCam (this is their proprietary PC program you use to record motion to your drive as evidence of trespass or burglary). In D-ViewCam I would manually \"insert\" the camera in the settings area using the IP address assigned by the router. Then I'd hop over to MyDlink and find the camera via \"zero config\" and set it up there online. That seemed to eliminate lost feeds, and for several days it has run with no problem. Most of the time the software couldn't \"find\" the camera during a scan, so I opted to key them in manually. It's easy. On a few of the cameras they still would not \"connect\". But if I walked away for a few hours, bingo!  It was as if it just took some time for the software to recognize them. One other thing, you need D-ViewCam to change the camera resolutions. I could not do this in MyDlink.There are a few quirks still.  MyDlink app has stopped giving me motion alerts. I can define areas of the feed to detect motion in D-ViewCam, but no longer in MyDlink web. It just shows a black screen. It will let you define a zone, but since you can't see what the image is it is of little use. I think this is why I'm not getting alerts via the app.  I don't know what happened and am looking into this. But the D-ViewCam does record motion to my hard drive. By the way, I am using a USB external drive hidden in the basement in case someone steals my computer!Anyway, to sum up, the cameras do work.  Picture quality is good enough to make out faces and cars coming up the drive.  I can keep an eye on the dogs quite easily using the smartphone app, though the latter does require a good strong fast connection. Otherwise, it just times out. I really like the D-Link routers.  Coming from years of the Buffalo Tech, they are much easier to configure with their outstanding web based portal. Five stars there. And setting up the cameras is nice because you don't have to use the MyDlink software, which I found buggy and hard to install, or a LAN cable.I have two cameras inside, three outside under the eaves, and one out in my carport. I have the repeaters on the 931's active, but even when they are off the range to other cameras straight from the router is good (about three walls, one brick, and 70 feet total). I plan on adding more cameras, including the IR versions for dark areas. So far the cameras have held up outside in below freezing temps and high humidity. They stand out like a sore thumb, but I figure if they get stolen it's too late. The video has already been captured. Because of this and their relative low cost, I have not taken measures to hide them. Hell, I want the thieves to put their faces in them so I get a close view!It has been a frustrating two weeks messing with these buggers.

It does a basic job.The cons:1. Very short cord. You will have to situate it close to an outlet unless you don't mind running an extension cord.2. The instruction manual is not very intuitive and the installation process from the website is not very intuitive. I can see that a lot of negative reviews about this camera coming from this. They probably used the wrong software as there are several models to choose from and the box has what appears to be a model number but it is not. The model number is on the cover of the manual and I can see a lot of people not reading the booklet and just going straight to the installation wizard. I made that mistake myself as I was so eager to get it going. I ended up choosing the wrong software and as a result it didn't work.3. This camera is made of a cheap flimsy plastic and so you must place it where it will not get banged around. Installing to a wall can be a risky undertaking as you will have to snap open the base using a screwdriver.4. The biggest con for this IP camera is that you cannot view with your camera on your phone's 3G or 4G. You have to connect to your network at home in order to use it. I used the Dlink Lite app for this purpose. It's a wonderful app but misses the whole point about taking your app outside of your home.5. Does not work with Firefox or Opera. You need to use Windows Internet Explorer.6. Requires Java installation which is not something that you would normally want installed on your computer due to some security issues.7. Constantly disconnects.The pros:1. Great picture quality. Of course, it is not DVD quality. It is webcam quality.2. Has adjustable sensitivity for movement detection. You can have it watch only a certain area or the whole picture frame.3. Sends an email to you if it detects motion or sound. You can adjust the sound sensitivity, too. It is able to send you an image or images when it detects motion but you will need to know how to set it up.4. It is wireless so you can place it anywhere where there is an electrical outlet.5. Has a range extender that will enhance the range of your wireless network to allow the camera to be placed further away from the router.6. It is pretty small.7. Has night vision capability. I was amazed at the image I got from a dark room.8. Has the option to allow you to choose wired connection.There is one review that gives out misinformation. And that review states that you should sign up for an account before installing this software. Well, you cannot sign up outside of the installation. You see, you need to do the installation in order to sign up.This camera does a very basic job. If you are looking to simply view a room or family while away, this will do the job if the camera does not disconnect on you. If you are looking for the ability to carry an app with you to view the images, then this is not the one to get. I could not get it to stream any image via a cell phone data line. But, if you are only looking to monitor a room from within the home and not while away, this will do the job. Further, it does not support micro SD card so it cannot record images without a network drive. If you have some tech know-how, this should be no problem installing. If you are not tech savvy, you may have some difficulties. In either case, if you are patient, you should be able to install this product. One advice: use the manual wireless set up instead of the sync connection with the router. That did not work at all with my router.Update:I have been using the camera now for about a month now and have found another issue that I should share with others. The camera's motion sensitivity setting is basically useless as it detects the slightest movements such as those of a curtain or atmospheric light change. I had set it at the lowest sensitivity setting and selected only a small area of the frame. That results in constant emails from the camera. Be ready to receive tons of emails with constant detection of movement. The sound detection was not as bad, though. Either I got a bad camera or there is some serious problems with the motion detection feature. Another thing that I have discovered is that the Dlink Lite app which was pretty useless ran in the background using up resources.

I wanted to set up several cameras to watch different areas in my home when I'm not there. This is a day only, 1-way audio(I can hear what is in the area of the camera but can't talk to anyone there), there is no pan and tilt. It works wirelessly for the signal but yes, you have to have a wire to plug in to a power outlet. You also have to use the provided ethernet cable and connect it to your wireless router to do the initial set up. When I first opened the box, there was a CD that was clearly marked \"begin here\". I put it in the drive on my computer and followed the direction and this little puppy was up and running wirelessly in no time. I could then unplug it and move it room to room and each time it was still communicating wirelessly. If you do unplug it and you want it to have the right time, you do have to rest the new time but that is pretty easy and can be done wirelessly. Since this was my first dlink camera, the set up took me through setting up my mydlink account. This is free and you log in to it to watch your camera when you are away from home. Your computers can be off while your gone but your modem(I'm on DSL) and wireless router need to be working. I set this up to send  6 pictures to my email on any detected motion so I can also see snapshots of things that may have happened when I wasn't watching via the mydlink website. You can also use the Dlink lite free application to watch the video feed on a Kindle HD. Once I was happy with this camera I mounted it on a wall in my home office and it detects anyone that enters the office. This was mounted several months ago and I haven't had to do anything to it. I can watch the office from anywhere at anytime and I can check emailed images to see anything I may have missed. After this camera, I thought I would move up to a day/night, pan and tilt camera and bought a dcs5010L which I have found requires a lot more attention and has a few issues. However the 5010L made me realize how nice this little camera was for the price. I do wish it had the day/night feature but I don't find the pan/tilt that useful on the other camera for my current use.

You can also do a time out after first detection before it emails again. Something I should have done when my second floor neighbors were moving in. Setting up the email is a chore, you need the various settings. I had issues with setting up my @live address so I made a @gmail one. Settings are easy to find on search engines.

Path: Here is the one I had issues with. MY path for MY NAS is //Security/FrontCamera where \"Security\" is the user and FrontCamera the directory I made in that user folder. I saw some indications on the dlink forums that the exact method of the paths / or \\ may be interchangeable so if one slash ain't working slash it the other. Options for storage for ftp are:AlwaysSet days and timesMotion (no time out)1,2,3 frames per secondx (your choice) seconds per frameImage Quality is decent for what I paid. HD this is not.

Still happy with it though.*MacGuyver Moment*For those who are adventurous, I was able to tweak this to work with my Wilife Pro 6-PORT POE Power Injector.  The injector itself was a steal at under 20 bucks.  And since the cam was going outdoors, I didn't want to have to run another cable for power.  I already had a network cable run, so I just grabbed a shorter patch cable and an Ethernet adapter to join the 2 cables together.  I cut into the shorter patch cable, then separated the power wires from the Ethernet.  I stripped the Blue + Blue/White and Purple + Purple/White wires, and twisted them together respectively -- one's the positive, the other the negative.  I connected those to an old 2.1mm power connector, and voila, instant POE cable splitter.  Just plug the other end into the POE injector and you've got power and data over the same Ethernet cable.  I figured the wiring was all there anyway, so I may as well tap into the 4 unused wires for power.  Worked like a charm.If you're not adventurous to make your own POE cable, then just buy one of these: AIR802 POEPASS-01 Passive PoE Injector/Splitter with 5.5 mm x 2.1 mm DC Size ConnectorFYI - this IP cam suffers from the same intermittent video glitches as this D-Link PTZ DCS-5020L.

I upgraded the firmware to the latest on each one, which as of 4/15/2014 is 1.10. All of them work well if connected via the Ethernet connection. Wireless worked great for me so long as I used WEP wireless security, which is what my DLINK router was configured to use. Since I have a number of 802.11n devices now, I decided to change my network from using WEP to WPA since WPA fully exploits 802.11n speed. However, making this change has caused me a lot of grief with the cameras that using wireless. After reconfiguring them to use WPA to match the router, none of the cameras worked & caused the DLINK router to crash. Rather than changing my router back to WEP, I decided instead to disable the wireless feature on the cameras and hook them up to wired Ethernet. This was not a problem for me given where I am placing the cameras near LAN outlets. I have read posts from others complaining about the wireless functionality having issues with this model camera. I am suspecting that maybe it would work fine for WEP but not for WPA.For the cost, I am still happy with the camera as it meets my needs. If I want wireless, I probably will go with a more current model.Original Review:I have a number of these cameras. I have a few around the house to keep an eye on things. They do an ok job. Resolution is about what you'd expect for an IP camera at this price. I have some connected via wired Ethernet, others are wireless. They work ok even at night having my porch light on, so I really don't need the night vision that the nighttime camera provides. Works good with MyLink app. I haven't tried it with the D-View app. I also plan to try it with ManyCam software, but haven't had the time yet. I am also using a couple to keep an eye on a remote location using the MyDlink interface. In that case, the camera is wired to the router and I get decent performance viewing remotely across the internet using Internet Explorer as my browser.All in all, I'm satisfied with the camera for what it does and the price.Dlink Customer support, however, is horrible. I called once and the guy I was talking with seemed clueless on a simple matter I was having with the stand. I eventually figured it out myself, but their tech support was not helpful and seemed dismissive.I've used Dlink products such as Routers and earlier model IP cameras, and have been mostly satisfied.", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy.

The last two had the same issue, which meant they would not work until new firmware was downloaded.

First, you insert the supplied CD wizard and use it for several steps.  Then you must download a NEW wizard and the new firmware.  You put the firmware on your desktop and unzip it.  Then you put the camera's url into IE, which you found from the first steps before the original wizard crashes (you had better know the url of your router too).  Then you must find the firmware from the desktop and do several steps to download the firmware to the camera.  The DCS-930L must be hard wired into your computer, which also must be hard wired into the internet.  Then you use the new wizard, not the old one.  You also must choose the hard wired option for the camera.  The option for wireless operation in the new wizard does not work.  So you finish up and you have a camera which is hard wired.  To change it wireless, you must go to settings and answer 3 more questions.  You also need the password for your router, after the program finds it.

It is also easy to have to camera send its data to an FTP site.The range and video quality are both very good.  The automated software and the mydlink website make it all simple to use.  The camera stays connected to the network, and never stops broadcasting.The only task that isn't very easy to set up, is having the video go to a local hard drive.

Since my initial review, I have continued to have very good experiences with it.  Here are some more observations:- It reconnects to the network within 20 seconds, if you unplug it and move it to a new spot.- Though it works great over Android, they keep updating the software to make it more and more reliable.  The camera always stayed connected to the net, but the phone would sometimes lose the connection.  That is no longer a problem.- Also works on iOS products.- I have played with the Motion Detections settings in conjunction with FTP quite a bit recently.  The camera is working great, and is highly adjustable in this regard, but the FTP service on my Linksys E3000 was giving me problems.  Initially, I thought the camera wasn't working properly, or wasn't adjusting to my settings, but when I switched the FTP to an external site from my router, it is working fine.  Either my E3000 isn't working right, or something with my network settings was causing it to intermittently disconnect.  Either way, it isn't the camera's fault, because it is now working fine, connected to a remote FTP site.  That is better than having it store the images in the house anyway.------ Update July 2011 --------This camera continues to perform very well and gives us a lot of peace of mind.

I was thrilled when I discovered that this is not only a nifty security camera but also a pretty nice baby monitor. Many baby monitors on the market are pricey and loaded with features I'd never use, so this works fabulously as a no-frills, high quality monitor. The audio is great. I can hear my son turn over in bed and thanks to the quality night vision, I can see him clearly as well. He tends to have nightmares so I have really loved having the ability to keep an eye on him at night and being able to go to him before he wakes up crying. I know this isn't the intended use of this camera but I think it's absolutely fantastic as a baby monitor. When not using it as a monitor, it's also a pretty good security camera as well. I've used it numerous times already when away from home to keep an eye on my property and my golden retriever. The motion detection works flawlessly and the ability to set it's sensitivity it's great. Surprisingly, the wifi extender actually works pretty well. I'm not thrilled with having to have it physically plugged into my router, but it was easy enough with the right length ethernet cable. I had an extra port so it was no big deal there. I was able to tuck it under the edge of the carpet to run it to the central room in my home when I was testing, though I did move it back to my son's room after that. Without the ability to record, I feel that it's a bit pointless as a security system but it IS able to record with the appropriate equipment. As is though, you would have to be actively watching when someone was breaking in and physically take pictures yourself of the intruder. Not as difficult as it may sound thanks to the email alerts, but still not a perfect system for security purposes. The email alerts are timely enough that you could alert the authorities if need be. For the cost it's very functional and a pretty cool little gadget. Installation was very simple and I was up and running in 15 minutes, with the most difficult part being the running of the ethernet cable across the house.

Ready to go out of the box.For everyone else, set-up was a bit of a challenge. To begin with, you download the D-Link software, plug the camera into your router and into a wall outlet. The software couldn't find my camera, so it advised me to plug my computer (a Mac) into the router (rather than using my wi-fi). Long story short, after reconfiguring my computer to a wired setting, finding the camera and then reconfiguring my computer to a wireless setting once again, we were good to go. An hour later. To save time, we also tried downloading the PC software version on my husbands PC and it worked fine right off the bat.On to the next step - running the internet viewing program. But once again, I ran into Mac trouble. Safari and Chrome both have Java settings that don't play well with the D-Link interface (this is a Mac issue). Rather than uninstall Java 7, change some settings around and install Java 6, as D-Link suggested, I just downloaded Firefox, downloaded Java 7 and we were good to go. On my husbands PC? We were able to log right in no problem.Once the camera was set up, I unplugged it and moved it to another room. It works great! There is a slight delay, but the picture is great for the cost and the audio is even better! Very impressive. The base is sturdy enough that you can just set the camera on a counter or you can mount it with the two included screws. I haven't mounted it yet because I will have to wire an outlet into the attic to avoid having a cord running down my walls. The infrared view is pretty darn good, too. Not perfect, but night vision so rarely is. The wi-fi repeater works ok, I got a little bit of extension out of it, but I certainly wouldn't buy this based on the extender alone.Now on to record the feed. But here again... a Mac issue. D-Link has software called D-ViewCam, which allows you manage multiple cameras and to record, including manual recording and scheduled recording. Sounds nice. But I didn't get to test it out on my Mac because D-Link doesn't even make the software for a Mac. Without being able to record, this camera is kind of useless to me. I doubt I will be watching the camera the very second a break-in occurs. So (are you noticing a pattern here?) we installed the program on my husband's PC and, after a little fussing around, got things up and running. You can set a recording schedule, run playback, etc.The Ipad app works fine - you can see a live view and set up audio or video alerts. I have two dogs, so it is awesome to be able to turn on and off sections of the video alert so that meandering dogs don't set off the video sensor.Disregard the question of whether you really trust a live, internet-connected video feed in your home (I'm looking at you, NSA) and you have a nice little camera. I would give it 5 stars if you are a PC owner, 3 if you are a Mac owner, and 0 if you are a Mac owner who wants to record the video feed. C'est la vie, I suppose.It seems to me that D-Link needs to invest a little money in their Mac users.

The video is actually good except in low light. It is amazing how basic cameras can produce decent video. However the sound is horrible. I get this buzzing and hissing no matter what room I put it in. And tech support said there was nothing they could do. Keep in mind thought that might be my particular camera or wireless set-up.Which brings me to tech support and setting the camera up to use wirelessly. Do NOT use the instructions. The instructions are going to tell you that you can set up the camera by using the WPS button on your router. At least on mine that wiped out my network settings and made it impossible for computers and phones that had connected before to connect again. My router maker, the highly rated Mediabridge on Amazon, said that every router with a WPS button makes it so that if one device connects that way, they all have to, which is why they don't recommend it. Shame on Dlink for suggesting to use the WPS button when it might mess up people's network settings they use day in day out. That deserves at least a full star off for that alone.So I made multiple calls to tech support. They were always available but not very helpful. But I was able to figure out what to do because I basically figured my only option was to physically connect the camera to my router. You have to manually connect with an Ethernet cable the camera to the back of one of the slots on your router. Then use the Dlink software. This should allow the camera to be found and set up. After you have everything set up and a Mydlink account on the Mydlink page click on camera settings. A new window will open. On that window choose setup and then on the left hand side choose wireless setup. Make sure the SSID has the network name of the network you want to use, if not click site survey and it will look up networks. Then the key to getting it to work not tethered to the router, put in your network password in the Pre-shared key box on the bottom after choosing the correct security you use on your network. Then you should be able to remove the camera from a physical connection to your router and place it where you want. After I did that the camera did take a few minutes to change from red to green, but it does work anywhere now that it has the correct security key.As I mentioned there is an Iphone app. Search for mydlink lite. You have to have already set up your mydlink email and password. Put those in and you can see the video. It does work great but there is no audio, which in my case is fine since the audio scratchiness is unbearable anyway.. It also take surprisingly good pictures and saves them to your camera roll. Tech support kept saying you download the app from our website. And I kept saying that doesn't sound right are you sure the app isn't in the Apple app store? And of course it was in the app store. So it is what it is with their tech support, not impressive. Even with the bad manual and bad tech support I still would have given 4 stars if the audio had been ok. But my audio is unusable. However that might be some quirk with my network connection. But every other job I am asking my router to handle it is doing a superb job.

The camera is only VGA so it is not a large image, but for most users it is large enough (the ones I got at work have a higher quality video feed), I do wish it was larger, but this will work for most uses.I like the D-Link cameras over some other Network cameras since it allows IP setup, and allows me to use Recording Software (D-Link has some on their website if you can find it) and access the cameras without using their setup (although you can use both).  So for work for example I have the DVR software running and it records the camera feeds and I can still use the MyDlink app.  This camera is mine so it is at my house and I do not need DVR support at my house, so I am not using that.  Although it is good to have if you ever need it.You can download the free MyDlink App to watch the feed through your smartphone (I believe that the tablet version costs money, but the smartphone is free, I am using an iPhone).  It works nicely and allows you to take a snapshot which is nice.  It has the same abilities as the web interface, and [in my opinion] works better since the Java applet is slow to load on the web interface.The night vision is nice and you can see a dark room with no problem.  It does not reach far, but for most standard rooms you can see what is happening.You can also setup alerts for certain events by going to Settings in the camera or on the MyDlink website.  This is nice for areas or rooms that have no one in them and should not have anyone in them, since it can alert you if someone is in them.The camera also has a repeater which is nice if you have a large business or house.  It will allow you to connect the camera to your WiFi and than put the camera at the edge of your WiFi reach and it will extend the WiFI further!  My home WiFi covers my house and most of my yard so I do not need this, but it is nice to have!In the end this is a great camera, it works good and the night vision is nice.  I like that the MyDlink service is free and if you did not want it you could set the camera up as an IP camera and use it that way.  The camera is very nice and can be easily mounted, although you do have to run wires.  For low end security or home monitoring this is nice and the ability to use a DVR Server is nice.  I wish it had a higher resolution, but it is still pretty nice and easy to use.", "Date": "June 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "doesn't work with Apple - macintosh", "Author": "Bill S.", "ReviewID": "R3N5HE7XC9PEVM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This product is really frustrating to use with an Apple or mac computer.

My primary purpose was to let me know when the UPS/Fedex/Ontrac guy dropped my packages off. I didn't want to have to run cables to an AV source or rewire my entire house in order to do this. This fits my needs perfectly. Setup was pretty straightforward. Do yourself a favor and skip the CD they give you and just download the software off the website. Apparently the software they provide is out of date and you're going to have to go to the website any way. Same thing with the firmware update. Just download the file from the website. Figuring that out took the majority of my time. I'm pretty tech savvy and I had it up and running in 30 minutes flat (mind you most of that time was fiddling around with the CD.)It comes with screws and washers and a wall plug. I mounted in my front window and had a great view of my driveway and front walk. The video quality is not going to blow you away. It's okay. I don't think I'd be able to use this to give to the police to identify a criminal by their face. But for being able to tell if/when someone came up to your door it's great. The Ontrac guy came today and I could read the Ontrac on his van and I could see him walking up the walk but I couldn't make out any of his features. Setting up the email notifications was pretty easy. Just google the proper settings for your email provider and type them in. Motion detection works pretty well. I've been having to tweak it to get it to just pick up the movement I want. It's pretty easy just takes some trial and error to get the setting right. I had it too low and it didn't pick up my car leaving the driveway. I had it too high and it picked up a leaf blowing across the driveway. I'm pretty sure I found the sweet spot now though. Take your time to find the right sensitivity for your needs. I have mine set up to email me when motion is detected. You can have it take pictures every .5 or 1 second. When it detects motion it can send you the pic instantly or send you 3 frames before and 3 frames after. That's the one I chose.The iPad and Android apps work great. On my iPad and tablet it's almost real time video. On my Android phone (using the cell phone data) there is about a 10-20 second delay.All that being said, I actually ordered the night vision model (the 932L I believe.) I plan on keeping this and moving it to view my backyard and I will use the new one in my front window. This one is pretty worthless once the sun goes down (unless you leave a porch light on all night or have some other sort or light source in the area.) I knew this was only the day model so I'm not upset but I just realized I'd rather have the night vision ability. Keep that in mind when deciding.Once I get the night vision one up and running I might pick up another one of these to use when I go out of town to just monitor the inside of my house.

There are three versions of the installation software, none of which works properly.So it appears that this camera has very severe software problems that prevents its use.  It certainly is not worth the purchase price of $94.  It only installs as an x86 and not as a x64 so I think that the software is not designed to be installed on a Windows 7 computer but on Winxp and it will never go in on a Windows 7 PC.  It won't install at all using Firefox.  I could only use IE in my efforts to install the software.I have emailed Dlink twice regarding error messages.  There is a very quick Java error message on the screen but it is only there for a fraction of a second so I cannot read it.  The Java box indicates some kind of applet is missing. I uninstalled Java and installed a update. Still the same thing.  I turned off my firewall.  Still the same thing.  Did a reinstallation.  Still the same thing.And a certificate is necessary, but you can't get it unless you authorize it but there is no way to authorize it.I sent 2 emails to Dlink.  No response except an acknowledgement.I'm not an expert, but I am not a novice either with computer hardware.So far my experience has been very very poor and I don't think I can make this thing work.Maybe I'll order the 89 cent camera that is available.  It should work as well as this one.In any event, I will wait a couple of days to see if Dlink contacts me with a solution or x64 software or something.We'll see.Update: Well another day has gone by and nothing from Dlink.  I tried to install the camera properly again, but just that it just about impossible on a Win7 environment.  I am going to have to return it because I cannot get the software to work properly.  Amazon should mark this item as \"FOR DLINK ROUTERS ONLY\" AND \"NOT FOR WINDOWS 7.\"  I do not understand how anybody can say installation is easy.  Installation is a nightmare.Further Update:  Another day has past and nothing from Dlink.  I was able to get to the configuration server bypassing the certification problem by \"trusting\" the configuration site.  I was able to make the software a little more responsive by making it compatible to Vista, but the underlying problem is that there are no drivers for windows 7 for this camera so you just cannot operate it with the software.  Thus it cannot do all the little goodies the manufacturer claims in Windows 7.I thought I would try to install it on my iMac Intel which is an older computer, but the built in webcam on it is spectacular, but this camera needs Java and, CONTRARY TO THE COMMENT PLACED HERE BY DLINK, there is no Java for Mountain Lion 10.6.8, so I am SOL there too and I am not going to upgrade the iMac which I rarely use.I have spent too much time trying to make camera work so it is going back.Moral of the story is:  Don't buy if you are using Windows 7 or Mountain Lion on an IMac.

You need to use the enclosed CD wizard which is slow and frustrating (you'd think in 2010 setting up an N network device would be straight forward!). I ran the wizard with the Camera attached to my TimeCapsule router which is really an Airport extreme with built in hard disk multiple times. It found the Camera and allowed me to assign a password to it. It wouldn't identify the internet access (DHCP) in my case. And the most frustrating point was once it scans for the network and I put my password for WPA security it wouldn't go through. I kept getting an error message with an advice to use an Ethernet connected computer to complete the process. I had to move my router to another room to try to do that and still with the same result. I actually gave up and started repackaging to return to Amazon. But I googled WPS connection to see if I can try it. Luckily I could. WPS is a way for you to connect a wireless device to a secured router without entering a password. Most of the time it gives you one to two minutes to press a WPS button on both the device and the router and they connect to each other without having to enter any information. Airport extreme and from my understanding a lot of other routers while not having a physical button to push do have the capability for WPS from the administrative software for the device (check your router manual or google it) . On the Airport extreme you launch the Airport Utility, select your router, Go to manual setup and from the top menu choose base station and then select add wireless client and Click the WPS  on the camera and then the corresponding software button on Airport Utility and just like magic they connect. I wish I knew this before I wasted more than an hour trying to setup a connection with the Ethernet Cable.Once setup you go on with the CD wizard you setup a mydlink.com account and it works. Once you do that you don't need the CD (or windows for that matter) I setup 2 iphones to check on the Pets bedroom which is why we got the camera.The quality is not that impressive but I got it for surveillance and for that it does what it should.The bottom line it does what it says.

I have them in a variety of indoor spots, and have used some of them for years.Pros:* Has good image quality* It's *very* small* Has been very reliable over wifi (most wifi cameras seem to have issues)* Has a very good web UICons:* There is a glitch in the audio where it has a ton of noise* Can't easily integrate with some camera software, since this camera always requires a password on the MJPEG streams* No IR or low-light capability.  In darkness, you just see a black screen (some other non-IR cameras can at least see some low-light).If the audio worked, this would be 5 stars.  It's amazingly cheap & small, perfect for small monitoring.  But the audio contains some digital background noise, rendering it nearly useless for baby monitoring or clear listening.  Most people wont need this, but it's a known issue and very annoying.  Some background: the noise happens even with wifi disabled.  It's not (that I can tell) a power-related problem.  It appears to be digital (not analog) interference, like a sampling issue.  And it has a regular interval of silence every 10seconds or so, which makes me think there is some overlap with the 60hz cycle power and the audio encoding that don't quite match up.  Guesswork there, but this isn't \"move it around and get static\".  It's just part of the electronics.Also - it would be great to loop this into camera software so that I can monitor it along with other cameras in my house.  However, my foscams can take username/password in the URL itself, but this camera cannot (indeed, I can find almost no information about integrating this camera's CGI/API), so it's harder to work with vs. the foscams.Overall; if the audio worked, this would be the perfect cheap non-IR fixed wifi camera.

When it detects motions it uploads pictures to my external ftp service (exavault).  I gave up setting time periods for detecting and uploading motion. (my first camera which works at night is setup the same way)Setting this up is a hassle but it's sort of working in a compromised way.  The good news is that other security hardware and vendors are a complete nightmare.The day camera (vs night/day) has some inherent issues with partial light.Part of the software problems comes from using browsers and Java for the setup and viewing.  If you're running Chrome the latest Java doesn't work.  Putting the previous version is an issue on Mac.  Also, you have to add IP or DNS exceptions for the Java security which is tricky.  I ended up starting the setup at home on the mac and finishing it at work on my windows machine.It's confusing why you have different ways to access the camera and setup.  One through mydlink and another directly to the camera IP.  I gave up mydlink since there were many requirements to get the second camera added.  Fortunately, the direct IP does the job even though it looks like it's an advanced setup screen.You'll need a good understanding of router port forwarding if you have multiple cameras.On another note, for 20 bucks more the day/night camera is worth some serious consideration over this one.The picture quality is ok (not great).  The wide angle is fairly limited.  It is nice an compact and easy to screw into the wall.  The light indicators are accurate and it boots up fast.  It's small and discrete.And heck... if it doesn't work at all who cares.  If it's in plain view it's still a deterent lolI like it and it's mostly doing what it says it does.  Lucky I'm an engineer otherwise I would have tossed it off the terrace :)In a real world it's probably worth 3 stars but on a curve it's worth 4.Please read this feedback D-Link.

Also had to download an updated version of the installation wizard so it could locate my router.  One I performed these functions, I was able to get the camera to work with my wireless router.Definitely not a high quality picture...and has everyone has said the sound quality is very poor.  That being said it works quite well for what I need it to do - a pet moniter.  I sometimes have to leave my dog home alone 10-12 hours.  Now from my laptop or Galaxy S4...I can check on him when I need some piece of mind,  I just ordered a second on for my bedroom...as he likes to crash on my bed on occasion.One last point, seems everyone slams the Dlink support hotline.

First they wouldn't link up to my wireless network, so I got on the phone to D-Link support, and after over two hours on the phone the best they could do was set it up so it would work on my wireless network but not on the internet.  In other words, I could only access the cameras when my pc was hooked up to the same wireless network that the cameras were on, which is basically useless.  After some more wrangling over the next couple months I finally got the cameras to work properly, in the meantime discovering that the audio quality was so poor as to be virtually useless.  If someone was talking in the room I could only hear a garbled sound with no chance of understanding what was being said, and there was more background hiss than there was actual audio.  An then the firmware upgrades began...I had to upgrade the firmware (the website won't let you view the video until you do), which meant uninstalling the camera and power supply and taking them to the wireless router because it requires wired connections between the camera, router, and PC.  While upgrading seemed to go fairly well, the uninstalling and re-installing took time and effort that I really didn't need to be spending.  Then a week later I tried to access the camera over the net, and ANOTHER firmware upgrade had to be done, which meant going through the entire process all over again.  I'm so disgusted with these cameras that I'm going to just throw them away rather than go through the entire upgrading mess all over again--if I'm going re-install my cameras I'd just as soon do it with new ones from a different manufacturer.

I use it inside my house, at the front door, aimed on my outside porch.Physically, the product is fine. It seems slightly flimsy at the base though - but acceptable.I set it up by using the wps button on my router to wirelessly connect, and that worked very easily.I especially like the option where I set it up so that anytime it detects motion on my porch, it sends me several pictures of what it detected - sent to my email account.One thing I don't like is that in order to change most settings, you need to do this at a computer - even though there's a phone app. The phone app doesn't let you really customize settings - it just lets you see the camera feed. The problem with the computer is that in certain browsers, I can't seem to access the features. I can't seem to use Chrome or IE; but Firefox seems to work. Logging into your MyDlink web account gives you access to the settings - kind of looks like the settings menu on a typical internet router.One issue is that in order to use the phone app to view the camera feed when you are OUTSIDE of your wifi network, it is required for you to use dynamic dns settings (DDNS). It's not that difficult. There's an option in the settings from the MyDlink web account (you'd have to be inside your wifi network to do this) where you can add in information for DDNS. But first, you'd go to a DDNS provider (I use DynDNS - dyn.com) to obtain a dynamic DNS of your choice (mine is $20 per year). This DNS allows you to have a customized IP address which you would input into the MyDlink web account settings to tell the security camera what your router's IP address is (because IP addresses change from time to time - but your DDNS customized IP address won't change, and will always map onto your router's IP address even when the router's IP Address changes).", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Cloud Camera for the price,", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1TOF8966HPF4B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pro: Price is reasonable at around $35 and camera optical quality is adequate ,Con: Setup was a guided wizard that I had to run 5 times to get it right.

It a triple whammy of love that D-Link's used to get loyal customers and I'm a convert.You have to sign up for a dlink account off of their website but it's relatively pain-free.

Also, the sound detection will take picture and email you when you are not logged.  So no worries if you are timed out. You can still get pictures sent to you.One flaw: no Pan/tilt remote control.

The installation was easy, taking me only about 10 minutes to connect the camera to my router with the provided Ethernet cable and to run the setup program on my computer.  Once installed, the camera can be disconnected from the router and taken to any indoor location within reach of an electrical outlet and the router's WiFi signal. The camera housing is lightweight plastic and is easily tipped over, as I discovered when I initially placed the camera on the same table where we keep our TV remotes and Xbox controllers. I recommend either mounting the camera on the wall or placing it in a low traffic area. The camera is small -- about the size of a cell phone with the stand adding a couple of inches in height -- so it could be concealed fairly easily for use as a nannycam. To view the video feed from the camera on your computer, simply set up a mydlink account and login. From the website, you can turn the audio feed from the camera on or off, switch between daytime and nighttime modes, adjust the brightness, take a snapshot, and zoom in or out. You can also set the camera up to detect sound or motion and send email alerts.  You can even have snapshots sent to your email address at designated intervals. The video quality is good.  Unfortunately, you cannot remotely swivel the camera to pan around the room, so the view is dictated by where you place the camera. The camera itself does have a nice swivel mechanism at the top of the stand that allows you to adjust the camera angle easily.

You can always configure it to your liking if you mind the security issues of having the data routed through D-Link's servers, but it's truly plug-and-play.- Slim, light weight form factor makes for easy mounting and positioning. The build quality is excellent.- Night vision with infrared LED (similar to Sony's nightshot in that it mechanically removes a filter) really does work well, though you would also be seeing only in monochrome.- Sound pick-up is pretty good. Makes for usable sound detection.- H.264 compression makes for smaller video files and lower data transmission rates.- Added function as a wifi-extender, which is essentially a repeater, useful in expanding your wireless network to cover dead spots at a sacrifice of speed.. If you manage to get hardwire ethernet at the site of the camera, you've effectively turned it into a full speed WIFI access point, which is even better.- Wireless N means ease of positioning. Reception has been decent.Cons:- Gets pretty hot, though it has not presented issues with crashes.- The image quality really leaves a bit to be desired. Granted it's not meant to be HD, nor does it have optical focus, but this is just a mid-low end webcam quality--from 5 years ago--with all that fuzziness, low color saturation, and sub-par low-light performance (without nightvision turned on). It's serviceable, but a low end PC webcam from a reputable brand should do at least as well and more likely better.- MyDlink app feels unfinished and can use not only more options but also more polish.This is akin to a mini computer with webcam and network capability. Therefore the software and firmware really makes a tremendous difference in its functionality. Thankfully D-Link has provided with My-Dlink feature that makes for easy set-up--I was able to set up remote viewing with minutes. The software has the most basic features: activate motion or sound detection, activate night vision, and turning the sound on or off. The interface looks unfinished, however, and there are multiple versions of my-dlink app on the Google Play Store, with some that's already obsolete (why is it still there to confuse people?). I hope D-Link eventually polishes up the interface software and maybe add more features and controls. However as it stands, it does deliver on its promises--you can easily view from the web (via smartphone, tablet or PC) without any issues or the toil of setting up port forwarding. Some image quality and software quibbles aside, the decent build quality, good wireless connectivity and repeater feature, as well as a solid night-vision IR mode--this is a truly functional camera without many useless frills.

In fact it sat in a box for a few weeks silently intimidating me with its networking cable and my worry that it wouldn't want to connect to my router.Well, long story short, though the camera wasn't as easy to install as the box made it seem, it was all right in the end.  (Basically, unless you have the exact router that the package mentions, your camera will not automatically synch up when you plug it in.  That's ok, as I never believed a camera would synch up so easily anyway.)In the end, I had to install the camera using the \"alternate\" method.  I connected it to my router (with the included cable), went over to my computer, created a new account on the D-Link website, looked for my camera, and linked it.  Then, I downloaded an app on my phone (for free) which allowed me to also link up to my camera (and then typed in the credentials that I had recently generated on the website).Finally, I logged in to my iPhone App, saw all available D-Link cameras (which, in my case was just the one), clicked on the link, and was able to view streaming video in about 5 seconds.  It was pretty amazing.The quality of the broadcast signal, however, varies depending on your phone connection.  When I was in the house (using Wifi) I got a perfect connection.  When I was at work but viewing the camera remotely, using a 3G signal, I got a good connection, with screenshot updates every 3 seconds.  When I had a half signal (3 bars) I got a decent connection, which basically showed screenshots that updated every 5-10 seconds or so.  Finally, with only 2 out of 5 bars on my phone I was not able to connect.I was really pleased with how simple it was to use my camera for remote viewing.  I did not think it would be so easy, and I can see how this can be really useful for those who want to just plug it in and view away without installing any special cabling.  (It has a 3 foot power cable, so you really can just place it anywhere in the house with an outlet.  And, as long as you also have wifi, you are good to go.)Note: this camera does not offer a DVR service, so it is not a security camera, per se, it is just for live viewing.Another thing I loved about this camera was the \"night view\" option.  When the room didn't have enough light you just clicked a button (on the camera app) on your phone and suddenly your picture switches to a black and white night mode, which increases viewability tremendously.The only thing that I couldn't get to work was the volume -supposedly I can hear through the camera, but it did not work remotely.  Perhaps the signal needs to be wifi for that to work?All in all, I was pleased with the camera.  Relatively simple to install (though you need a computer with internet access to do so), or a large phone screen so you can do the website registration on your phone...The free phone app and the night mode make this a very cool product.

It seems the infrared LEDs will cause interference with the picture at night, maybe reflecting off the window its looking thru.

The mobile mydlink app makes it easy to check in with little effort after initial setup. I am not limited to using the mydlink app; if I have a static IP address, I can do my own custom setup without using D-Link's remote service.I use the D-Link DIR-850L wireless router to connect with the camera, which made setup a simple, automated process by simply connecting the camera's included Ethernet cable directly into the router and the system took care of everything for me. Once finished, the Ethernet cable is disconnected and it is ready to go.The camera's options are abundant. I can set the day/night mode to automatically detect daylight, or I can put it on a timed schedule. I can change the bandwidth allotment for the camera to my own preferences to manage the network traffic it uses. The image can be sized, I can set the frame rate, I can turn the audio on or off and I have the ability to use the camera's built in wireless transmitter to extend the network coverage throughout the home.I believe I would need to keep my computer turned on to take advantage of letting the software access my e-mail client to send captured images triggered by the fully customizable motion and sound detection, but I do not use the feature at this time. It offers the ability to select image regions to use for motion detection, so I can choose the grid area that is on the top of the door without worrying about excessive alerts caused by it having been triggered by pets walking past other sections of the monitored image. It is quite an effective and flexible system.I think this is a great camera, considering all of the basic PC webcams I have bought over the years for nearly the same price, and all those did was open up an interface for an image, and nothing else.

I couldn't figure out how to get it to record audio. It plays audio on the computer and tablets. I even got it to play audio on the realtime view when the camera was recording. But when I went back to play or save recorded video there was no audio. If I figure it out, I'll do another with audio. +update+ So I called again was again for help on recording the audio. I was told I was in the wrong area when I picked the correct options in the phone tree. Then I talked to someone who was completely unhelpful and when she didn't think she could find an answer, she hung up on me. But this camera doesn't advertise audio recording, so I don't feel that I should punish it for that. I almost knocked it a star for the horrible phone support. +end update+Really this was pretty good. The video/audio quality is as expected. The app for ios iphone/ipad is pretty good. But it is not nearly as easy to setup as I expected from what the box said. For easy setup, you have to have a dlink cloud router.If you don't have a cloud router, you need a pc with java and active-x to setup the camera. Durring the installation you have to plug the device into your router with the included cable. When it's done setting up, you no longer need a network cable (but you still need a power cable). It does want you to create a mydlink account during the setup. You don't have to use mydlink, but you can't use the mydlink app without it and remote access is more difficult without ti.Pros:-good video and audio quality.-once it's setup, it just works.-the app works well on my iphone 5 and ipad 3. I get good connections over cellular and hotspots.-you can take pictures with the app.-you can set it up to email you when sound or motion is detected.-auto day/night feature works very well. It's nice to be able to see the kids sleeping in the middle of the night.-network extender sounds like a good feature, but I'm not going to use it.Cons:-no two way audio for this model. I can see and hear the kids jumping on the bed, but I have to go upstairs to tell them to stop.-the only way to record video is the extra D-ViewCam software. It's cumbersome and I can't figure out how to record sound. It's really clunky to use. It turns off UAC. It autostarts when the computer boots. It's annoying and dumb, but I didn't get the camera for recording. I want this for the easy phone/tablet viewing. I'm going to uninstall the D-ViewCam software.-the view is about the same as other cameras I've used, but I wish I had a wider view.-The power cord is short for higher mounting.-Called Dlink support at 2pm on a weekday and was on hold for 30 minutes before someone told me I was in the wrong area. There was only one camera selection on the first menu, but they said I needed to be to the Mdlink area, not just the camera area. Then I waited about another 30 minutes before giving up. I just wanted to know about recording sound, and I didn't find help on the website either.It wasn't horribly difficult to setup, but there is easier. If you really want easy to setup, the Motorola Blink1 is the most easy to setup I've seen. The Blink1 also has 2 way audio, tilt/pan, temperature, etc. But this is less than half the price. This Dlink was easier to setup than a Foscam.So I had a few issues, but it was with things I didn't care about in the long run. So I rounded up my 3.5 to a 4 star review. The main thing I care about is the app view and that works well.", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great basic camera", "Author": "B.

It was really easy to install. The daytime video is good, but faces are hard to identify on the picture. Audio support is decent. Capturing video and still images to FTP works well. The capture length for video is configurable with a maximum capture time of 15 seconds. I have mine set to 10 seconds which equates to about 2 MB per video file. Still pictures are about 32 KB each. One downfall is that there is no optical zoom and the digital zoom on the camera is very pixelated. It is attached to my wireless network and it has no problems transferring the capture files to my FTP server. I have also used it on a cabled network and that works well too. Email alerts are configurable, which is a great feature for a security camera. An interesting ability of the camera is the ability to act as a wireless extender.

But How Secure?", "Author": "APC Reviews \"APC Reviews\"", "ReviewID": "R269CZXS5HP7LB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The D-Link DCS-933L Wireless Day/Night Network Surveillance Camera with mydlink-Enabled and a Built-In Wi-Fi Extender is an excellent surveillance and security camera for use in interior situations. It does not pan and tilt, and is not weather proof. How \"excellent\" it is may come down to how comfortable you are with \"the cloud\" as a natural extension of your personal space. Although sold as \"secure\" recent news developments and reports clearly show you are potentially taking a Big Brother into your life when you get involved with this technology.The D-Link DCS-933L has different levels of functionality that depend on how integrated you are into the DLINK Cloud system and whether or not you have a recent model DLINK router. The further you get away from the DLINK eco-system the more manual the configuration becomes, and the fewer of the advertised features are easily available. At its most base configuration, it's a day/night video camera that can be accessed via your router. To get the remote monitoring, from a smartphone or laptop, you have to be registered into the DLINK Cloud system. To get the instant \"Zero Configuration\", plug it in and go, easy setup you have to connect the camera to a DLINK router with MYDLINK account access. To use the Windows or Mac setup Wizards you have to download your OS specific Wizard from the DLINK site.Using the Wizard guides you through setting up a MYDLINK account. That, to me, is the weak link, so to speak, in the whole deal. What you are basically doing is setting up a 24/7 monitoring device in your personal environment that needs to go out to a remote location and then back in to your system, or to a linked remote device, to be accessed. That's a lot of trust to put in pictures with sound of your home being broadcast continuously, to outside your own space. As it is the stated ambition of the government cyber security forces to capture everything that everyone transmits, stores and communicates everywhere all the time, and retain it forever, if they can ever build a big enough server farm to store the stuff, you might contemplate whether or not you want years worth of your personal life in real time video stored somewhere that may then be mirrored and archived elsewhere, not under your control, and porous to snooping.Secure? Of course, as much as anything is. Absolutely secure? Well, these days, if someone wants to access it they are going to access it. They may be hackers. They may be someone with \"authorization\". Who knows? Some people may think this is a ridiculous worry and not worth thinking about. Others may consider it a serious issue.Using manual setup is more like setting up another wireless router, bridged to your main router. This \"routerness\" of the camera is in fact part of the camera's function as a range extender for your wireless devices. More complication and security concerns. It's also how you configure the camera to email you snapshots, alert you, email you vid clips and so forth. If only this was all being handled from within your home network, and not via a remote system. But I digress...Depending on your level of router security, the setup may be more or less difficult. If you have port isolation enabled, for example, you are putting up a wall to certain functionality of connected devices. All devices that claim to work seamlessly with your home network depend on you having a rather low, integrated level of router security.As to how it works: it works very well, with excellent image quality, but is feature limited somewhat by the level of integration into the DLINK Cloud and MYDLINK system.

I've been wanting something that I can use for keeping an eye on certain areas of the house when I'm downstairs working in my home office. This fits the bill on many accounts, with only a few things I wished it had.The video quality is very good for the size and price. I was able to get the software working with no problem, and I could monitor the feed from my desktop machine as well as from my iPhone. The wireless capability is excellent, as it gives me part of the freedom I need to place the unit anywhere in the house. The downside is that it needs a power connection to run (no on-board batteries). Being that our house is on the older side, there's not as many power outlets as I'd like, and it's a bit of a limiting factor on where I can use it (especially if I don't want obvious cords hanging out).Probably the biggest downside is that it doesn't come with a built-in way to store or record the video. That takes additional (read \"more expensive\") hardware/software to make happen. So if you want to use it to keep a record of the area being monitored, you're out of luck. On the other hand, it does have motion detection, so it can email you a snapshot of what caused the triggering of the detector. That might be \"after the fact\" instead of real-time, but it might be what allows you to see \"who dun it\".All in all, this is a cool unit to have around in certain situations.

I do not use this as a robust security solution but it does allow for email alerts for motion or sound activity. The camera is very easy to setup as you simply download the .zip file from the D-Link website and run the install and follow the instructions. It took me about 3 minutes total to set up the camera. From there, you can view the camera from the MyDlink website or from your mobile phone device. The web access seems fine if not a little slow but I have tested several cameras from Belkin and D-Link and they have the same lag. I will have to say that the iOS app for iPhone is a really slow on loading up the camera.

I emailed D-Link and they pointed me to the right link on their site.  I, however, could not get the software to download.  I would rate myself as having higher then average computer knowledge, and after multiple attempts, I was still unable to get my computer to fully download the software.  That being said, I would have given this a 5 had I been able to test it with the recording software.The picture is good, but you really have to have a good amount of light in order to see anything.  The Night feature is perfect for this!  You won't see it in color, but you will see everything clearly.  I used my Droid phone, downloaded the free app., and tested it with my cat while I was away during the day at work.  There is about a 10 second lag when used with my smartphone.  I have tested it, and counted to determine this.  There isn't a lag when I view it on my computer.  With the app., you can take photos with it, in case you needed to.I haven't played much with the computer software, as it really doesn't do me any good to view it while I am here at home.  However, the software itself is user friendly, and was fast to install.  I think it only took me about 15 minutes to get the camera up an working.  I love the wifi feature!  I can place this camera anywhere in my home.  I have a D-Link router, so the instructions matched my unit.  You plug it in, download the start up wizard, and it leads you through what to do.  I had absolutely no problem getting it up and running quickly.  I didn't need to refer to the instructions that came with it except to locate the website so I could download the software.If you can get the recording software to download, this is an excellent camera!  I thought the picture was fantastic, especially the day time image, as it is in color, and very clear.  If I can get the recording software to work, I will change my review.

It does not promise to be a whole-house security system with real time recording, etc. If you want that, look elsewhere and expect to pay more.But what you do get is a very good camera with high quality imaging that can be set up quickly and accessed by an easy to use app.I installed this camera in a matter of minutes on my home system (Mac based). The installer really was a breeze. The free iPhone app also installed quickly and in less than 10 minutes after opening the box I was monitoring my kitchen and living room on my iPhone.Daytime-mode images are nice and crisp, and the night-time images are also very good and seem to have a range well beyond the 15 feet D-Link indicates (perhaps I have more ambient light in my area at night). You can also connect the camera by cable or wifi, but wifi seems to be by far the best choice as then you have much more flexibility as to where to place the camera.Other reviewers have complained that without a recording feature the camera isn't very useful, as you would have to be watching the feed all the time to see if anyone was breaking in, messing with your stuff, etc. However we have a good home alarm system and if it ever went off we would be notified immediately, which would allow me to turn on the app and check the camera right away. The app also includes a photo option, so you can take still photos from the D-Link camera that are saved to your Photos app (on the iPhone/iPad anyway).Two minor issues were 1) the iPhone app sometimes doesn't connect to the camera, and needs to be restarted to get the feed; 2) there is a 2-3 second delay in the feed, so it is almost but not quite \"real time\" (this may be a function of network speed, cell-phone distance, etc.). And of course, should your network go down, the camera is useless. But that almost goes without saying.For the price, this is a good-quality camera. It requires manual monitoring but unless you are willing to pay much more for a hard-drive based surveillance system, in this price range the D-Link camera is a very good option.", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Surprising video quality and ease of use; does not come with record feature", "Author": "Mark B", "ReviewID": "R2NKMLBHG6OJFN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Dlink has been doing a great job reshaping their whole line of wireless products.  We replaced our old TPLink router with a Dlink Cloud router a few weeks ago and were very impressed with the results.  And now we have acquired this wireless camera and are equally impressed with it.  Dlink is beginning to create a Dlink ecosystem, where you can remotely access your Dlink Cloud-enabled wireless devices over the internet.  That means you can control and monitor your home network and wireless cameras from anywhere you can get on the internet.  Setting up this camera took literally less than five minutes.  With no fuss at all, we were seeing the camera on our network and viewing images on our Mac laptop, iPhone, and iPad.  The picture quality in full light was a quality VGA image (don't expect HD, since this is a wireless camera and it is viewable over the 'net).  We then tested it in full darkness and were not disappointed.  We could easily see the advertised 15 feet.  The one catch in the darkness is that the first time we set it up, there was a sidewalk lamp in the image, and the light from that lamp tended to wash out much of the image.  So be sure to test your placement before leaving for your trip.  The mobile app for this camera allows you to change zoom and switch from daytime to nighttime mode.  You can also setup the camera interval (continuous feed, intermittent snapshot, etc.).So the quality of the camera at this price range is very good.  Ease of setup is a major plus. Do note, however, that this camera does not come with the software or hardware to record video.  It would be 5+ stars if it came with an SD card slot to capture (and loop) video, or if it came with software to record a loop of video or stills online or to a computer. If you do buy this camera, you just need to understand that it is live \"surveillance\" which may not be appropriate for a true security system.  We use it to check the house once in a while while on vacation and it has worked great for that.  However, if your home is compromised while you are a way, this camera alone will not capture and store the incident.  Also keep in mind that the camera does not have a battery, so it needs to be plugged in all the time and is not suitable for exposure to bad weather.

One of my nearby neighbors runs an in-home day care and we installed it in her house so she could keep an eye on the main day-room when she was not in the actual room.  She uses her smartphone to monitor the activity while she is preparing meals or doing simple chores.  Installation was simple, not plug and play, but plug, download set up software, sign-up and play.  The unit can be easily mounted to a wall or ceiling (screws included) and the camera itself is on a swivel head so it can move anyway you need it to if you attach it to a surface.The picture was pretty impressive in a normally lit room.  The field of view was wide enough to cover almost the entire room.  Not the greatest quality, but still pretty good and totally adequate for our needs.  I don't think it was designed to be a hidden camera, but it is small enough, about the size and weight of a deck of cards, to at least be unobtrusive.  The sound quality was also fine, but for our purposes we didn't need really high quality sound, we just needed sound.The place we have attached it there really isn't much use for night vision as nobody really uses the room much after the kids leave.  I didn't have a chance to test the night vision much other than to turn the lights out in the room and wait for darkness and then move in front of the camera.  For that it appears the image is view-able to about 20 ft. We set up the auto e-mail function for movement just to test it and it worked every time we tested it.  We didn't really get as many false positives (actually none) because the room is almost all artificial light with very little light coming from outside to throw off the motion detection system. Turning the light on in the room sets it off every time.We have been very happy with the set-up we have and although we are not using the camera to its fullest potential, it has become a very handy and useful tool in this environment.

I completed the initial installation, including the MyDlink registration in about 15 minutes, just by following the instructions step by step. I did set up the camera with a different username and password than I did for the MyDlink.com web account, since it appears that accessing the camera remotely, also reveals network settings. I have another DLink camera and both are accessible from the same website/user account. During the installation you may want to also check the DLINK-dot-COM website for any firmware upgrades (which can also be done later if/when necessary) and a copy of the Windows Setup Wizard.

Seriously, there is nothing to it even for a technology-challenged person like myself. To me that is the best part of the product.A couple of things to note, the camera really begins to get hot if you leave it plugged in for extended periods (hours). I would not feel comfortable using this as a 24/7 type of unit. But for operating a couple of hours for a specific situation, ours being a child visitation hosted at our house, it's perfect. The streaming leaves a bit to be desired as sometimes it stutters. That could very well be a product of my older computer or our internet server so I can't really dock it for that. But the stuttering is minimal so no worries. Last point, if you plan to maybe hide the camera for stealth monitoring it is probably too big for that.

Since I turned this feature off, my network has gone back to completely stable.Original:I like the software on this DLink camera better than the hardware.  The app, and the web interface both have more options than the similar Belkin Netcam.  I use the Dlink lite app with this and it is okay, but they do occasionally lose connectivity which requires me to reboot it to restore it's connection.  The picture on this, is just okay - image quality seems subpar compare to the Belkin netcam HD, even when you factor in hd vs non hd.  However, the DLink does better in low light/bright light than the Belkin does.  What I like most about this camera is it's advanced web settings (this is something the Belkin netam doesn't have at all) which let you set it up to record activity to FTP server or send email pictures.  I tried the email option on motion detection, but that really produced a lot of false alerts.  Instead I set it to record to an FTP server, which I set up with my asus router to use one of my router attached usb drives as an ftp server, and this works flawlessly with very few false alerts.

With the wireless extender option turned on, I know have full wifi signal in every room in the house.  The PTZ camera is identical in image quality and advanced web settings with the only added feature being the PTZ, which I reallyt don't use much because it moves slowly and only in increments.

The Panasonic has excellent picture quality and fantastic software. The Dlink costs less but has a few quircks.First off the Dlink DCS-933L webcam is slow to connect to the network and it is slow to open the video every time you open or change to the video web page. These aren't huge issues because you rely on motion detection most of the time, however, motion detection requires JAVA to set up.Installation did not go according to instructions but it's not that hard to set up. I used (and prefer) the browser to set up and access my webcams instead of installing software. This way you have the same interface anywhere in the world.  I tried the D-View Cam software but immediately ran into trouble so didn't bother with it and uninstalled it.The built-in software has too much extra junk on the screen so that you have to scroll to see the full cam view. Yet there are no record, snapshot or other useful functions while viewing the image. It takes several seconds for the image to come up each time you visit the page. Brightness and other controls are on a separate screen so you can't see the image as you make changes - bizarre.This is the only cam that I have ever used that requires JAVA to run MJPEG video and for setting up areas for motion detection.  Unfortunately you have to install JAVA if you want to use motion detection because you have to CLICK all of the areas to MAKE THEM WORK (contrary to what the screen says). The manual states otherwise and in order to see the screen to click it you must install JAVA.You can only select one FTP server. The Panasonic allows you to setup several different triggering times and options each having its own FTP settings. For instance, for one trigger I have it capture an image every second for a web page, other triggers are set for motion detection and upload to a different server.Accessing this from outside of your network is as easy as setting up port forwarding on your router. Works great!Image quality indoors is really good especially getting correct colors. I tried to point it outside through the window but the image was washed out and I couldn't get it adjusted to see much.Caution when updating firmware, the links on their website are not correct even though you click on the specific camera and choose firmware you aren't taken to the link specific to that camera on the next page, you must select it again.I like the size of this little cam for the picture quality it gives.

This one actually works and is easy to use. My experience has been that most IP cams SAY you can use your smartphone to monitor your home via smartphone, but most either don't work or are very hard to configure (meaning figuring out port forwarding and other router configurations). The marketing prose says \"easy\" but the marketing wears off as soon as you open the box. I have also seen some recent products geared to smartphone capabilities come on the market that were met with mixed reviews, so I have held off trying them. This model, however, I think has finally made it workable and easy for the average user. Please note I am using a wired configuration, so I don't know how well the wireless feature works.Pros:---I am in a Windows and Android environment, so I don't know how it performs on Apple products, but the set up was quick and easy---Using the android app, My Dlink Lite, on my Galaxy S3, the setup was easy and the video image came through beautifully. Again,this is the first IP Cam I have found that actually works as advertised on a smartphone---The video resolution is fair, but far better than other cameras I have been using. The colors are excellent but the resolution is not high enough to serve as reliable evidence in court testimony. For everyday use, however, it is good---Nice sound capabilities, which can be turned off---Notifications by e-mail can use images, video or both. I found this feature to work better than any other camera I have tried---The price, I think, is a great value---Using MyDlink you can view from any computerCons (none are deal breakers, to me)---Can't pan camera. The field of view is pretty wide, about right if you are monitoring a driveway, for example, but I would like to see D-Link come out with a model that can pan back and forth/up and down remotely---Motion sensor allows you to pick the areas to watch, but only in chunks of square blocks that can't be finely tuned, so you may end up with areas you don't want---Smartphone app has had trouble connecting a couple of times so far. If I log in or out it starts working again. Not sure how often this will happen, as I just started using it, however, I am hoping firmware and/or app upgrades help (There was one new version of the firmware available I just installed)---Motion detection too sensitive, even on lowest level in basic setup options, but read on below for solution---Night vision not great, but better than others I have tried. If you have outdoor motion sensitive lights, you can see enough to figure out what's going on (it caught an interesting snap of a bird in flight)A couple of things to note:1) Nowhere could I find anything that says if this product was for outdoor use. I installed it outdoors, but I'm in S. Cal. and it is under a overhang, so it isn't getting exposed to much. If anyone knows if it can be used outdoors, let me know2) The setup and configuration options available in the basic setup probably will do for most users. However, I was very glad to find more options and abilities in the Advanced Setup section. You login in with your same credentials as your MyDlink. For users with a little more knowledge that average about IP Cams, this section is really useful and easy to use. One thing you may want to venture into it for is the sensitivity settings of the motion detection feature. The basic setup only goes down to 25%, but you can set it to whatever you want in the Advanced section (see my Update, though).So, this is my initial review, which, I admit, I did earlier than I normally so, but this camera works so well, so far, I just had to get something out right away. I will follow up and revise as needed.Update 7/15/13: I decided to turn off the motion detecting e-mail alerts. Even set at the lowest sensitivity and selecting a small area to monitor, it sent \"false positives\" too often. A common problem with motion detection is that it is often triggered by changes in light, like when a cloud passes over. This model doesn't have a solution for that (I e-mailed D-Link customer service last week, but I haven't heard back from them). I may use it if I go on vacation. Otherwise, the camera is still working reliably on my smartphone.Update 8/29/13: D-Link Support finally answered the e-mail I sent in early July. Wow! Pretty slow response time, I would say. They said, yes, changes in light trigger the camera to take a snap, and to just play around with the settings more.

The Android app worked fine for me (Samsung Galaxy) but the reviews seem to suggest \"hit-or-miss\" for different handsets.For the price range, it is a good IP camera once you get beyond the installation issues. The app with its limited functionality will serve most people's occasional monitoring needs but may not be sufficient for a security camera. For more serious applications, a family of products from Panasonic that includes body temperature sensors may be worth the investigation.", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "One of the better ones I've used", "Author": "M. Kelley \"mpkelley20\"", "ReviewID": "RYF6N2K43ZMGX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have several home cameras around my house right now.  An expensive outdoor Nexia one, an indoor Belkin one and now this D-Link one.  I have been trying to find a good system to use to expand my home coverage but I;m having a tough time deciding on what brand to go with.  Nexia requires a subscription (no thanks), the Belmin one worked great at first but seems to have issues when viewing on my Iphone over 3g/4g (the image is very sporadic on when it comes up).  The D-Link, so far, seems to be a good compromise as it loads fast and is equal in quality to the others from what I can tell.Setup was easy for me as I currently use a D-Link Cloud router.  I simply plugged the camera into an outlet and connected it to the router via ethernet and it was configured.  I logged into MyDlink accounts (I had set this up a while ago because of my router) and the camera was there for me to add to my devices and quickly begin using.On a PC, the video image is pretty good considering this is not HD video.  On my Iphone, the video looks great.  What stands out so far is the audio.  It is much better than the Belkin camera as it comes through very clearly.One of the other benefits to this camera is the ability to use this as an extender for wi-fi.  I use several other extenders throughout my house but more is always better.  I added this to my living room and now I get a very strong signal in my upstairs bedrooms which always had mediocre signals without it.  Setting up the externder was simple as you just need to check a box in the camera settings.  This can be done either on a PC or using the phone app.  You can also use the settings area to activate motion sensor and alerts.The funny thing about this camera is that it looks like my Belkin camera.  The Belikin camera looks like other cameras.  So I am guessing that there is some factory pumping out these los cost cameras and then the company is putting its proprietary software on it.  And I think it's the software that makes or breaks how well these will work.  So far, the D-link is doing great.  I would love to figure out a way to make my Belkin camera work on MyDLink but I haven't figured that out yet.

The Camera also has sound, and it rotates 360 degrees (manually).The only two problems are:1. The power cord is not routed through the base, so the photo is not that realistic.  The photo should show a power cord snaking away from the camera.2. The camera makes random clicking noises, it seems to happen when it turns on or tries to focus.  It sounds like an old mechanical shutter.  Not a deal breaker, but I would not want to use it in a child's bedroom as it might wake them up.The wonderful things are:1. Night vision, albeit only a short distance (10 to 15 feet)2. Motion activated camera, no need to see a constant stream, just review the scenes with motion in them.I have this unit tucked behind a curtain looking out a window so that I can see if my cats have left the deck for the back yard. The yard is about 75 feet deep and the fixed focus allows me to see right to the back fence very clearly (at least during the day).There is a third problem just for Mac users.

It's nice to have a way to see what happens when you aren't home.My chief requirements for such a camera were that it connect to my wireless network, have a motion detection feature, and that it be able to save the video files somewhere for safe keeping. The D-Link Wireless Day/Night Network Surveillance Camera with mydlink-Enabled and Built-In N 300 Mbps Repeater (DCS-933L) fulfills all of those requirements nicely.Setting up the camera was a snap. The manual directs you to the D-Link website to download the configuration software. After download, the wizard ran through the configuration quickly and easily. After setting up the camera, you can connect to the advanced configuration panel by using the IP address for your camera in a web browser - I used Google Chrome and it worked fine. If you have a D-Link router, I understand it is even easier to set up.The advanced configuration offers very granular control over a myriad of settings. You can adjust the video and audio settings, image quality, motion control settings, day and night mode, email, ftp, and the time and date.The time and date settings have an option to allow you to synchronize the camera's date and time with a time server, which is usually my preference. However, the D-Link camera was always an hour wrong using the time server (regardless of whether the DST option was enabled or not), so I finally changed to manually setting the time and date.The FTP option allows you to upload captured images and videos to an FTP site. This has been my favorite so far. I have an FTP server in my home network on my NAS device, and the camera is able to write files to it using the FTP server's internal IP address to avoid using bandwidth from my ISP for these transfers. I also tested the FTP settings with an FTP site outside of my home network and it wrote there just as easily. With most residential ISPs having limits on monthly bandwidth usage, however, it doesn't make sense to write it to an external FTP site if I have another option. Those without an FTP site could easily set one up using free FTP Server software such as Filezilla if you have a computer that stays within your home network, like a desktop PC.The email option allows you to email images and videos to an email address of your choosing. You must enter settings for an SMTP server to be able to use this. I used my Gmail account and within 5 hours, Gmail blocked my account due to excessive usage. I can't blame them for that - with several cats in my home, the motion detection feature was capturing images and video constantly and emailing each to me. I do not recommend using this option if you have pets who can access the area the camera is surveying unless you are sure your email provider will not block your account for such high usage. My Gmail account was available again after about 12 hours, but I do recommend that anyone using this feature consider setting up an email account dedicated to just this process rather than an account you use for normal email. If your email is blocked, at least it would not be one you rely on. Another thing to consider with the email option is that you are using bandwidth with your ISP for every image and video that is emailed. This could quickly get high if you aren't careful. While it is nice to have the email option, the FTP feature serves my needs much better.I do wish that the camera could write to some of the file services such as Dropbox. That would be convenient, but of course would use bandwidth and you'd need to be sure you have enough free space in your account to use it. That might be why it isn't an option.This camera also offers a wireless extender option. Basically, it has its own wireless access point built in so you can connect your Wifi devices to it rather than your main wireless router. If the camera is in an area of your home where there is a weak signal to your main router, this is extremely helpful. I recommend allowing the camera's extender option to use the same wireless network name as your primary router and also giving it the same password. That way, connecting automatically to the wireless network with the strongest signal will happen seamlessly as you move around your property.One thing I really wish this camera had was a wider angle camera or the ability to pan and tilt. For the price, I would have expected one of those features to be included.D-Link does offer an app for Android phones and iPads to be able to configure and view the camera remotely. The app works pretty well, although the video is halting even when computers connected to the same network as the Android device stream the video without interruption. I've only tested it on my Motorola Droid Razr Maxx HD and my Kindle Fire HD, both Android devices. I do not use iPads or iPhones.One thing that really disappointed me is that the resolution for viewing live video over the internet. If the device you are viewing the live video on is in the same network as the camera, the video resolution is 640 x 480. However, if you are viewing the live video over the internet, then the resolution is only 320 x 240, which makes it hard to see what is happening in the video. The resolution in a web browser on a computer is worse than the resolution on my tablet or smartphone. I do understand that the smaller resolution setting will save bandwidth, but would prefer this be a configurable option.This camera has a foolproof setup and great image and video quality with a robust feature set.

For some reason this camera could not find my wireless network when it scanned for wifi networks, and the wps setup took 3 tries to take, very inconvenient since my router and computer are on different floors. Once set up, the camera started live streaming through the website, and could also be accessed through the cameras IP.Having read, \"sound and motion detection\" on the box and on the amazon product page, I spent a bit of time looking for recording options. Eventually I confirmed, THIS CAMERA DOES NOT OFFER CLOUD STORAGE OF VIDEO RECORDINGS, OR COME WITH RECORDING SOFTWARE. For all the capability of a wireless camera I was disappointed that the \"sound and motion detection\" would trigger an email being sent to an address you set. That means I could get an email, login in from my phone or work computer and I would have to hope that whatever set it off was still there in front of the camera for me to take a screen capture. For this reason I would only recommend this camera as is, as a baby monitoring device, or for other similar jobs where you will be watching the camera at all times.The sound and picture quality is great and indoors the night vision works very well.Overall: Minimally challenging to install, with great sound and video.

It is important to know what your security needs are prior to purchasing this system and see if this will appropriately suit your particular needs. This system is easy to use and provides flexibility but there are also some limitations such as no backup power and the power cord can be unplugged rendering it useless.

I could FTP them too but email is fine for now.So the device is great, but getting it to work properly, specially registering to mydlink was painful. The install CD had trouble with the wireless configuration a few times and them crashed when trying to register to mydlink. I eventually ignore the wireless wizard on the CD and connected to the device's own little web server to set up wireless. After that I went back to the wizard and skipped the wireless setup to register the device to mydlink. I wish there was another way to register devices to mydlink as I was concern the process for registering them from the CD would fail as the wireless setup had. But it didn't so that's good.So for about $60 I have live video from the camera, plus picture every 10 minutes. I'm definitely going to buy more. It's a great tool to have video from the office perimeter before I arrive to make sure it's all ok.However if you don't have networking knowledge I suggest getting a friend who knows so you can set it up for home or office monitoring as you could get frustrated.

It's easy to find a motion detector that screws into the porch light and then accepts standar bulbs (ccfl, etc) so the light wouldn't be on all night.. I found that this camera's field of view isn't as wide as I hoped, so will likely place this where the narrower angle and low light issues are mitigated.Bear in mind, this is a low cost IP camera.

It is a simple and low quality audio and video device with some fairly primitive but effective software.The configuration worked great. It took me about 20 minutes to configure the system to work in wireless mode with my wireless router, another 10 minutes to configure for remote web based viewing and about 20 minutes to set up the scheduled email so I would get several emails per day. I think the reason I was able to configure so quickly is because I had already done this previously with my Panasonic camera and knew all the settings for the incoming and outgoing mail server and wireless setup. If you have all this information in advance it should go quickly.The physical setup was not quite as fast. The unit has no screw down points on the base and since the unit is thin plastic it is very light and will not stand on it's own because even the weight of the power cord is enough to pull it over. I made a wooden base and a simple clamping system with a few screws and washers to pinch the base of the camera to the wood. There is a limited range azimuth and elevation adjustment and that made it easy to point.The software is fairly limited and will only let you set up either scheduled emails or motion sensing but not both at once. My simple Panasonic BLC1 camera is about the same price range can do both and has much more feature rich software with multiple event possibilities so you may want to look into that option.The pictures are fairly low resolution but in this price range I would say perfectly acceptable.The website has always worked fine for remote viewing but will time out after about 10 minutes and you have to log in again. You can change the settings of the camera remotely which I find useful.I tried pulling the plug to see what would happen to the camera and I found that it lost the clock setting so this will present a problem if you are relying on scheduled emails.I have had the unit set up for a month now and the temperature has dropped to -5C (23F) and it is still working well.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "works well", "Author": "Josh B.

The camera had to be plugged into the router for the setup, I could not do this wirelessly.  Once I got it running with a wired connection, I wanted to set it up wirelessly.  My Verizon FIOS router does not have a WPS button, so I couldn't configure it via that method.  I went into the advanced settings of the camera configuration where it allowed me to search for my wireless network and input the access key.  I encountered a problem where my network used a 10 character WEP key and the camera insisted on a 13 character key.  The only workaround I could find was to change the security method on the router to WPA instead (which is more secure anyway).  After that, I was able to enter the WPA key in the camera settings and the wireless connection worked like a charm.  Of course I then had to change the wireless key settings on all my devices, but not too big of a deal.

Because of this I set it up the way I was going to anyway which is manually and not using the dlink website at all; that process took a little bit of trial and error simply because they don't really give any instructions on not using their software (fair enough).I use this mostly for watching my dog while at work and bought two and once they are configured they work great for the basic needs im using them for; you can get sound although it won't pick up any subtle noises, it will get things like barking or howling (which I found my dog does apparently when not happy).The image quality is decent also, in a nicely lit room you can get very good detail on the cam and the FPS is pretty good if you have a good signal.

The setup process was easy to follow and the step-by-step process did result in a successful camera installation accessible via my local network.Unfortunately, viewing the images from the camera requires Java, which is strike 1. There have been so many Java-related security issues in recent history, that the most secure Java installation is the one that you don't have. It's just not worth the risk in most cases, and I only have one machine with it installed, and then it's only for a very limited use with one web site that I have to access for work purposes.But, for the purposes of this review, I wanted to see what the camera could do, so I allowed Java to run for this application. Unfortunately, that's where strike 2 comes into play. When you go into the camera administration, it wants to show you a live view of the camera. One of the apps it wants to run generates a security warning from Java, which says that the app (CVCA, I think it was called) has some security concerns, and is only partially signed by the developer, and the user should contact the developer to make sure that it hasn't been tampered with.In the game of security, you only get two strikes, and you really shouldn't even get more than one. When one of the most problem-riddled platforms in existence is flagging your application as a possible threat, you know you have a serious problem. This may be a false alarm, but it doesn't matter; companies should do everything in their power not to have such warnings appear in front of their customers.As a result, I cannot recommend this product to anyone that is not able to be sure that they aren't opening a huge security hole in their network by allowing this product onto it. In order to see this camera from the outside world, you have to open your network and allow access inside of it. How can you do that with confidence? I can't.

Here is what I think if this product.  Actually getting the camera on the wireless network is not so hard if you have a spare cable.  However one you have the camera up and going, its a nightmare to actually connect to it and view it.  D-link uses a java app which doens't seem to run on chrome at all, sometimes will run on firefox, and only seems to consistently run on IE after much java updating.  Basically its way more trouble than its worth.  Also you are stuck using their site out of the box which limits you to 1 minute of video at a time.  You can set it up to be a straight camera if you don't mind making some firewall modifications.

T. Beasimer \"www.LBphoto.net\"", "ReviewID": "R3NNCBRTIH5TZA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was sent a D-Link Wireless AC1000 Dual-Band cloud router to test and review, so I thought it might be interesting to the same with this camera.  We have a large house which requires the use of a repeater for full Wi-Fi coverage, so I also wanted to see if these camera's extender capabilities would allow me to discontinue the use of our Hawking HWREN1 Hi-Gain Wireless-300N Range Extender.The D-Link DCS-933L wireless day/night network surveillance camera, made in China, connected easily to our network.  The package contains the cloud camera 1150, Ethernet cable, power adapter, camera base and mounting kit, and the quick install guide.  I started by connecting the base to the camera.  Then, using the install guide's instructions, I connected the camera to the router by Ethernet cable, plugged in the camera's power cord, browsed to the mydlink website, and followed the setup wizard.  In about 5 minutes, the camera was networked and ready to locate.Using the free MyDLink Lite or the MyDLink+ apps, one can monitor connected cloud enabled D-Link surveillance cameras, set alerts, and make basic changes.  Camera specific options in both apps include volume on/off, take photo, image quality, day/night/auto setting, and display information.  Settings include renaming, Motion and/or sound detection, and extender mode. The MyDLink+ app adds a full screen mode button, the ability to assign an email for notifications, and a grid camera view.The picture quality is good as well, day or night. The picture is clear and in color during the day, and black and white at night.  The night vision does a good job of rendering an image, however light can cause some detail to be blown out.Adding cloud based functionality comes with a security risk.  Adding cameras to monitor areas of your home can open the possibility of your network being hacked or someone inappropriately opening the app on your device and accessing your camera views.  When setting up a MyDLink account, weak passwords are permitted; I'd suggest using a strong password.  Unfortunately, the apps save passwords and open without concern to your privacy.  This may be convenient, but I'd much rather be required to enter my password every time I access the apps.  There is the option of going into the settings menu and manually logging out of the application after every use.  Unless you intend to make heavy use of these features, it would be safer to avoid them or purchase a wired monitoring system.The D-Link DCS-933L wireless day/night network surveillance camera is capable of extending the wireless network range.  Placing the camera in an area with reduced signal and turning on the extender feature can enhance and improve overall signal strength.  With the addition of this camera, our network is more consistent in the area where placed, which keeps our devices from jumping to various networks.  This could be helpful when placing multiple cameras around your location.If you're looking for a basic surveillance wireless networked camera, the D-Link DCS-933L does a good job with the added benefit of being a range extender.  Unless you're looking for pan/tilt capability, the D-Link DCS-933L Cloud Camera 1150 is worthy of your consideration.PROS:Simple to connect and installRepeater functionality extends wireless rangeMotion/sound sensor and notificationsNo monthly service fees24/7 support1 year limited warrantyCONS:Use creates a security riskApps save passwords and auto log in", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "UPDATED", "Author": "Vynny \"Vynrod\"", "ReviewID": "RSX4LZEE8NWIM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Review update ****I didn't like certain aspects of the set up of this camera and feel needing to set it up on location by jacking it directly into your router, as opposed to just entering info, is an important thing to note. Imagine having set up your phone or tablet by getting cat5 out! However, I did get it going and finally got a chance to use it properly and I have to say the viewing software, phone app and camera quality is very, very good. Night vision is amazing and audio and imagery is crystal clear. For a camera at this price point, this is an excellent choice for home security or child monitoring.I still do not like the setup and feel it's a cumbersome way to get it going, but if you intend to install it and set it up in the area which it will ultimately live, then this is a great choice.I leave my original review (where I gave it two stars) below.***I  guess I'm in the minority as other reviewers here seem to have found this camera a good solution for their needs. Sadly I feel the set up on this device is the issue - not the tech, not the quality of the camera vision or indeed the cost.I'll elaborate. I acquired the camera to protect my camper which is permanently stationed in a wooded campground. Unfortunately this meant I needed a computer to set up the camera insitu and I only had an ipad/iphone. So I took a laptop to the area where there is free wifi and thought this would be a straight forward install...Sadly, you need to directly hook the camera up to the router via cat5 to set it up. So despite there being a free non-wep enabled open hot spot I couldn't connect to the camera at all without going to the main office and jacking into their stack system (something that's obviously not going to happen). So I then brought the camera home to set up there and found that it just wouldn't set up as my desktop computer was hardwired to my network. Again, I fired up the laptop and then I directly hooked the camera to my own personal wifi router.Only once did it see my wifi network and it took forever to write any information to the camera. Of course, during the set up I realised that it would therefore be indelibly tied into to my home network. In other words, I could NOT set up the camera in advance to my campground's wifi despite knowing the SSID and there being no encryption there.Okay, I thought, at least I can use it at home... but no it never successfully found my hotspot. Never connected even with cat5 and only once saw my home wifi SSID then the software just hung.So in a nutshell, you seemingly cannot set up this camera in a different location than its final resting place. As a wireless device I find this bizarre and hooking it up to the router to set it up is also bizarre - why not a USB connection I can prefill the info then take it out to my boat/camper/cabin etc?I'm sure it's a great cam when set up - but the set up itself is archaic and just was too unfriendly. Wifi printers these days work without hooking up to a router or indeed a USB connection - why not this wireless wifi hot spot extender camera?I may update this review if I ever get it going... but for now two stars - both of which are for cool form factor and diminutive size of the great looking device.", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good affordable solution for smartphone viewing", "Author": "almosthappy", "ReviewID": "RJY4YUB2SU8JD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall I have been pleased with this camera.  The night vision is surprisingly good and setup was very simple.  The My DLink app for Android works extremely well and I haven't had any glitches yet.  Obviously this is not an advanced security solution, but for someone who just wants to be able to view a single camera of their home or office to check on things, it's great.The main problem I have had is the inability to use it with Chrome on my Win 7 PC.  I am aware that some people have had success with Firefox, but I think it should be common sense for them to fix this so that it will work on IE or Chrome as well.  I don't want to have to use a separate browser just for viewing the camera.Overall, though, this is a very good price point for a wireless camera and it works great.

A little troubling", "Author": "Doug Hibbard", "ReviewID": "R1IHUHF0G8HM35", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Like all computer gadgets, there's the setup and the operation. Sometimes, the setup is easy the operation is a pill. Other times? It's the opposite, which fits the D-Link Wireless Day/Night Camera.I'll get back to the operation in a second. Let's look at the installation.First, the camera ships without software. It's a pet peeve, but I like having the program available, not having to download it. The download aspect has an annoyance. The camera ships in a package marked \"Cloud Camera 1150.\" The product description on the website is DCS-933L. There is a place on the packaging that shows that, and the model number is on the unit--but what does the package call it? A \"Cloud Camera 1150.\"What do you need to call it to find the software download? \"DCS-933L.\" Now, I found that without much difficulty, but if you're looking for ease-of-setup for the off-the-shelf user, then the main product name should be used for the setup program.Second issue with setup: to setup the camera, you need to plug an Ethernet cable into your router and plug the unit into the wall by the router--then move it, after setup, to where you want it hooked up. Your computer space may be different than mine, but my router is setup out of the way--and hard, therefore, to put another cable into it. I'm also pretty well maxed-out on outlets. I got it done, but it was a little difficult.On to operation:This is just fine. It makes the slightly hassled setup stage worth it, because now that's all behind me. Here are the benefits:1. Easy aiming of the camera coupled with wide view range covers a large enough area for security purposes. I can see all the space I need to see.2. Sound quality is good--if you need this to monitor audio, you won't find it good enough to sing along, but the words are clear.3. Wi-fi repeater works. It's limited by the overall nature of repeaters, but it extends the range out for my wi-fi, thus helping me avoid data overages on my cell.4. Motion detection is a great tool. It's also adjustable, and can be set so sensitive that the A/C blowing a piece of paper sets it off. Or you can back it off. Also, the software lets you pick what area you're looking for motion, thus cutting the cats out of tripping it.5. Software controls are pretty good--not super fast, but good.6. Email pictures are clear--it will email either a time-programmed shot or a motion-detection shot.7. The phone app works well. The tablet app has a glitch, but the phone app works on the tablet. The main advantage to the paid tablet app is the ability to see multiple cameras, but I have 1 camera, so the free phone app is adequate. I would like to see them fix the tablet app, though.I think this camera will be handy when we are going to be out of town and want a record of any motion/action within the house. Do keep in mind that, unless you tell it to email pictures, this device is *not* recording, so you can watch someone rob you blind but have no actual evidence. You will need to click the \"picture\" button and capture a snapshot.For now, though, it's going back in the box.

It'll also send you \"alerts\" to check the device output. All well and good... except there's obviously a time lag between the alert being sent out, you getting it, and then checking the camera's output. Whatever's happening better not be a short-term event, I guess. If you're looking for a full-fledged security monitoring system, you probably want to rethink this as a \"solution\".For one thing, it has to be mounted indoors. It's not a weatherproof system. I consider that a very limiting requirement. It doesn't record anything. So if something's not happening while you're actually watching the monitor's output... you missed it. Not good at all, especially if there's criminal activity involved, as your evidentiary material is non-existent.So... good as a nanny-cam or pet monitor, or to make sure your house isn't burning down while you're away.

The camera lens is slightly less than half an inch in diameter.  The camera is attached to a ballhead so it swivels in any direction. Back of the camera has the power port and the Ethernet port.  The included Ethernet cable is 39\" long (3 ft 3 inches).  The included power cable and plug is 60\" long (5 ft).If you have a DLink Cloud Router, the camera will configure automatically. If you have a different router, you have to download the setup wizard from the dlink website.  PC and MAC software both available, about 10 MB size.  The wizard is easy to understand. You can setup the camera wired or wirelessly, but during initial setup it has to be connected with the ethernet cable directly to your router or modem. I had it connected to a switch which was an extension from my router (which was an extension from my cable modem). It didn't find it when it was connected to my switch. But when it was connected to my router, it found it within 10 seconds.The Cloud service is through dlink's website, and it support IE, Chrome, Safari, and Firefox browsers. You may also need to download JRE: Java Runtime Environment for your browser, but it will specify if you need to download it. Once logged in, I had to update the firmware on the camera. Once installed, you can configure the camera and set trigger settings, like Motion and/or sound detection.  If the LIVE VIEW doesn't work, go to SETTINGS, and then come back to LIVE VIEW and it should ask if you want to enable JAVA.The camera captures sound. I was snapping my fingers in another room and it still picked it up clearly. You can take a snapshot of the screen, and also turn on/off NIGHT VIEW. The quality of the image is decent. The colors are accurate. Certain text won't be able to be read, even at 4 feet, but I was able to read other text at 8 feet away.  In complete darkness, the night shot is quite good, but it's in black and white.  I'll post an update with more tests. The camera body feels warm to hot after using it for only 30 minutes.I ran into a few issues. With Chrome, I had excellent sound, but no picture. With Internet Explorer (IE 32bit) I had picture, but no sound. IE 64-bit isn't supported. Then I tried to connect the camera wirelessly, but since I keep my wireless network from being broadcasted, it didn't display in the list of wireless networks, and I was unable to manually enter my network name. So issue there. I'll have to try this out wirelessly and see how it works and then update this review.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awful Product and D-Link Support equally as bad", "Author": "Marvin B. Holt", "ReviewID": "R19OOR6ZM2JZ8G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Hello, setup disc that came with unit would not autorun so I went to D-Links website and installed the software, That is required for the unit to work, and it was complicated beyond belief. I am very versed at working on networks and with network app's and this one was so frustrating that I had to call D-Link for support. The initiation wait time was 10 minutes ( this was on a Tuesday morning at 10:00 AM ) - I was on hold for 58 minutes. Support wanted to REMOTE into my computer to setup the Cam. I told them no way ! Talking about opening up a hole in your network, they are nuts to use remote control for a fix to there mess. I saw a new story this morning that showed a cam that had been hacked and the person was watching and talking to the family's baby. Back to the meat of this review - as I was on hold for this 58 minutes, I had plenty of time to check out the D-Link FAQ database. Here are a few things I found;One of the most asked questions was \" What do I do if the installation disc doesn't run on my computer ? \"Another one was ' How do I get a MyD-Link account ? \" --- A my d-link account is required for this camera to broadcast. It will not work if you don't have a my d-link account - Period. The installation disc that comes with the unit, if it worked, would take you through this process as you setup the unit. Without it you must contact D-Links support to setup this camera ( 58 Minutes on HOLD ). If I had known that this camera wouldn't work without having to be a d-link cloud member, I sure wouldn't have wasted my money on it.There are to many things bad about this unit, including after I set it up with supports help, the firmware was out of date. It has to be updated right out of the box --- come on D-Link, at least update the firmware or toss these units into the trash. That will be the next place these units will be, in our landfills ! They have lowered the price again and again on these units. That should have been a red flag. Trust me, it will be from now on. Don't waste your time or money on this unit. Once I got it working, the cams picture and audio were not even as good as the older webcams that are built in on laptops. The network part of the cam was in and out. I never was able to watch a steady stream. The app that you use with a smart phone is a 'lite\" app.To get the full app it cost you more money !

It is more like a series of still pictures refreshed randomly at 2 to 20 second intervals. Or often it just shows a black screen for a while.Viewed within my own house, using my cheap Android tablet, the video seemed acceptable. I assume cutting out the internet made that difference, though connections at both ends are not that bad normally.Well the sound feature, which the Diamond was lacking, is great. The infra-red night vision is super at indoor distances. The camera is simple, neat-looking, and reasonably compact. I had no problems with the setup or instructions, though maybe me having a D-Link router made things go smoother.I don't see any recording capability available...

Setup was not easy. I cleared some time because I knew this would probably take awhile (2 hours to be exact), and started by reading the very short manual. I followed the link to the setup and got nothing but a few D-Link headers and no place to download a set-up wizard. I got the complete run around on their website, and my blood pressure rose so high I wanted to throw the camera through a window.I took a breath, stepped away, and returned. The company's website seemed to be working and I finally downloaded the Mac Installation Wizard. The wizard was very nice and easy to follow. I set up an account and had the camera working in no time. On my computer I saw a little box video from the camera. Awesome! I clicked off of that and went to my account where I could view an actual larger picture  . . . and that's when things got difficult. I had to download Java 7, but I needed to uninstall Java 6. I tried, but I decided to let my techi-husband work on this. As of yet, I haven't seen a picture on my computer. BUT, that's okay, because really I wanted the camera to work over my iPhone.Besides telling me that there's a new Firmware download for the camera (constantly, even after I downloaded it), the video on my phone looks amazing. Ultimately I want to use this camera in my kids room, so I tested it out while they were sleeping. The night vision is superb! I wish my baby monitors were this clear. However, the camera kept making an annoying clicking sound, and flashing a green/red light in the back that was bright and bothersome.  The delay on the camera was also pretty bad, but that had to do with our internet connection and not the camera. So I tested the camera in a room with better internet connection and found the camera worked well, but there was still a 1-2 second delay.Pros:-Nice gadgety camera.-Wireless, just plug in the power cord and you're all set.-Picture quality is fantastic. Night vision is insanely good!Con:-Setup on the Mac is a pain.-Power cord seemed too short.-Wish it would zoom out more or pan.-Bright flashy light and noisy at times (not good for sleeping children).Overall this is an okay camera.

At the time I bought them, I was thinking I only wanted to look at them in my house to monitor my pet when traveling. I since moved one to point outside.
