The design and packaging are very \"apple-like\".  It's pretty sweet looking with what looks like great build quality compared to other ip cams.  Unfortunately that superficial stuff is all the positives I can talk about.  720p daytime picture is only marginally better than my other cheaper 640x480 cams.  Night-vision picture is exactly the same as those cheaper cameras, which is to say this one is definitely not worth the premium price.  Deal killer for me though was the audio feed.  It's all clicking clacking ticking tacking etc.  Couldn't work for me as a baby room cam as a result.  I'm considering the cheaper non-HD Y-Cam Cube (which is still pretty pricy) since the 720p spec didn't do much for me, but I'm worried any variation of the Cube will have this audio problem.

(see update below)I give them kudos for simple for the most part well-written website and collateral, but when I submitted a ticket on the following issue, no response for almost two weeks now.The manual states without qualification, \"... The Y-cam keeps track of the time even when power is disconnected\".  Perhaps it's qualified by the fact that it is written in the NTP section, but if so, it doesn't bother to make this point explicit.  As far as I can tell, it should be qualified by, \"as long as NTP sync is enabled, it will appear to the user that... the Y-cam keeps track of the time even when power is disconnected.\"  With no battery, I don't see how this is possibleI've tested this several times and the camera does not hold the time.I'm recording the files to a NAS drive and naming the files with the date/time information, so that the critical date/time information will aid in editing at a later date.This will be used for many month long nature photography where a power supply, but no internet connection is available, so using a time server is not an option.As you can imagine, this wreaks havoc with time-critical video files where the power supply is unreliable.So, I'll need to add a time-server to the setup that I didn't anticipate.

It is supposed to install easily but it does not. It is supposed to provide real time video but it provides about 1 frame per second; that is if it works at all. It has its own mind about connecting to your wifi - or not - mostly not.The packaging is cool; manual comes in 5 languages; Very Mac-like in appearance. However the 5 languages are oddly mixed up :( The Dutch instructions have German headers and who knows what the other weird typos mean. Since I happen to know all 5 languages I was probably the only person that was amused by observing the crazy mistakes. They cannot even keep the little flag Icons sorted out to match the right country. Little worrisome, but whatever. The QA department should probably catch the one and only document that comes with the camera if it has more than 30 errors per page. Moving on however... It says clearly (in English): put the CD in your Mac and proceed with the instructions. So here we go.The product comes with a handy mini CD. Very Mac friendly as it would seem from the company website. Well, beware poor Macbook user that would like to use the installation disk: inserting it in your laptop will instantly cause a trip to the Genius bar to get the darn mini CD out.Now off their website to find the manuals. There is some material there a YCAM program and Y-CAM program (this is not a typo). Again a little troubling that the company is still deciding how to name their own product, but typos seem not to bother the folks at Y-cam (that seems to be real spelling so both programs are wrong). Being a programmer for entirely too long, I really know that typos are a really bad thing when you do that in your code. But I am still keeping my hopes up. After all the Y-cam website has those lovely screenshots of my soon-to-be live image showing up on my iPad (or is that I-pad, or i-Pad?, well you get my point). Of course there is no mention which program is supposed to do what. It appears one is the setup program and one is a multi camera viewer. Both are very time wasting to the poor user. One problem is that they apparently do a full IP address scan to find a camera EVERY time you open/close a dialog or push a button. So a 15 second delay on every step of the way. That would not be so bad if the setup process actually was a one time through. No it is not. This is more like a 40 time through, so far and still counting. I just took a break to comment on my experience. The other problem is that one of the programs is a very buggy experiment from someone at Y-cam, while the other is intended to be the debugged installation program. Since are almost called the same, look the same (at least part of the screens do), and smell the same, that is mildly frustrating to the user.Well, lets call technical support at this point. Oh wait they are in England so that is going to expensive (no 800 number, international calling rates) and inconvenient (we only have a few hours of time overlap). But an email with all the screen shots of the settings and my detailed issues should probably do the job. At this point I am still happy and offered to fix their language horrors. Some friendly messages back and forth over the course of 5 days (it takes a few days cycle time for any reply). Finally a nice message that says my problem has been \"escalated\" to a real technical person since they had figured out that I was a \"professional\". What I did not know was that I was forced to turn in to a \"professional\" complainer soon.The escalated tech support start off very friendly again, most encouraging. After a few back and forth messages (yes 8 days later) it becomes clear that he did not receive any of the screen shots I had sent out with my initial request for help. No worries, we can send those again. Together with my fifth request to see if they can see my camera online with the information I provided including login password and such. I have to get an answer on that one. Just seems so obvious for a company that sells internet viewable IP cameras, but hey they seem to know what they are doing, or do they??Meanwhile, I am trying to get some result out of this 274$ purchase. It seems that buying a microSD card will at least allow me to record video, rather than have little white cube just sit as a decorative wall bug. Another $60 invested, and wasted as it appears later. The camera has some trouble noticing the SD card but after 3 power cycles it shows up reliably. The setup screen to trigger a recording is nice and the camera works as advertised (for now). For a brief moment there is a working solution, and I give up on seeing this thing on the internet for now - despite its claims of being an IP camera. Moved the camera to the house where it needed to be installed for security.New wifi, new connections, and ... yes... a whole new set of problems. This thing just does _not_ reliably show up on the network. The buggy setup program with endless refresh cycles is not helping. Three hours later, tried with directly plugging it in to the computer, tried hardwired to the network, and tried via wifi. It only and sparsely works when hardwired to the network. Painful to determine when everything is intermittent and each software cycle takes so long. But there is a connection now. Let's try a \"live\" image... one image per second stumbles across the network onto the screen. It takes 10 seconds to get the first frame, it also seems to randomly pause for 10-20 seconds. No, there is nothing else on this network, it is an empty house with hardwired gigabit ethernet. Plenty of speed to get 720 video from my iphone streamed live to an Apple TV in my other house. So no no network excuses here. Well ok, I don't care as much, since I am mainly interested in recording video when I am not there. This was already setup so it should still be doing that on triggers. Yup it does, files are showing up on the SD card. I can see them listed remotely via the network. But now the final step: copy the file from the camera to the computer so we can actually see it.. forget it. It hangs forever, not in streaming mode, not in download mode. Just a big empty nothing, no progress, no error, and no file, even after half an hour. Getting tired now. We are on backup plan F now: just let it sit and go the house to unplug the SD card and watch the video directly on the laptop. The word \"IP\"  in \"IP camera\" is starting to become really watered down now !10 days later: the camera recorded for a two days. The SD card still has plenty of free space. It just decided it was not going to cooperate. I am still communicating with technical support, going on 5 weeks now. This is the last message:\"For recording on your camera, you will need to enable \"Record on alarm\" or \"Continuous record\" from the \"Task management\" page under the camera settings. What size SD card is inserted into the camera?  Kind regards \"This information should have been obvious from my first support message. I knew that already. What they don't know at Ycam is a) how to spell their own name b) how to package, c) how to translate, d) how to not mislead their customers on their website, e) how not to break a Macbook, f) how to provide technical support effectively, g) how to get a turnaround time on tech support in the US that is remotely acceptable, h) how to make a device that reliable gets a network connection, i) how to transmit live video over a gigabit hardwired network, j) how to create bug free software.Ok, I am done here. Let's see if they allow me to return this product since tech support has gone on past 30 days.

This camera is essentially a web server too, serving up images or video on demend, but I never got it working outside my network.As mentioned in other reviews, the camera is not reliable.  For one reason or another, it will either not be on the network, or it will not take pictures/video when it should.  For one of the more expensive IP cameras, I would expect more.One feature I really liked was setting schedules for different activity.  This way, you don't get alerts during the night when car headlights are setting it off constantly.  However, this setting seems to reset for me constantly.  It's not even related to power cycling.Support has been poor.  They removed the forum, where users could help other users.  Now, it's all e-mail based.  That's fine, but the solution to my issue was getting new firmware.  I was told I would get a reply the next day, and I didn't hear back for a week when I asked for a follow-up.  I'm still waiting for a reply a month later.Pros:- When it works, it works well- Image quality seems pretty good- Looks good- Feature set is greatCons:- Unreliable- Schedules reset- Expensive- Poor customer supportI would not recommend this purchase at the current price ($275).
