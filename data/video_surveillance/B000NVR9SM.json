{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent camera, excellent customer service", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2VBS9HDXXB1T0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I wanted to keep an eye on the nanny with our baby from work.  After researching the network cameras for several months, it seemed that only Panasonic cameras consistently received positive (usually glowing reviews) whereas cameras from other major brands like Linksys, D-Link, etc received mediocre or poor reviews.  So I went with Panasonic.  And after about a month, I have to say I am very impressed with it.  Some background: I have a classic Linksys WRT54G 802.11g router, with 2 WinXP PCs connected to it via ethernet and 3 more PCs connected wirelessly; plus, I have AT&T;/SBC DSL service via a Speedstream 5100 DSL modem.  If you're moderately computer literate, you should have no problem following the included instructions to setup (view and control) the camera in wired mode or in wireless WiFi mode.But if you want to setup the camera to be viewed (and controlled) from the internet, you need to do a bit more work.  And this is where Panasonic's excellent, excellent customer support comes in.  Panasonic's support line is 8_0_0-2_7_2-7_0_3_3; they are open Mon-Fri 9AM-9PM and Sat/Sun 10AM-7PM Eastern US Time; this tech support is available to you for the LIFE of the product.  They will walk you through how to setup the camera, configure your router (for, among other things, port forwarding), and register with Panasonic's FREE Dynamic DNS web service.  This last point is important: Panasonic network cameras include FREE Dynamic DNS hosting service for the life of the product; other brands offer the service for an annual fee.Okay, step-by-step, here's how to config the camera for internet viewing:First, if you use DSL as I do (as opposed to cable broadband), you have to configure the DSL modem for \"bridge mode.\" (If you don't use DSL, then you can skip this step.)  This is because DSL modems act as a router, and port forwarding cannot work behind both the DSL modem's router and (in my case) the Linksys WRT54G router.  If you want, you can call your DSL tech support to ask them to walk you through how to \"bridge\" your DSL modem.  But here's what I did.1. Login to your DSL modem (for me, it's 192.168.0.1) using your DSL account (for me, it's my SBCglobal email address).2. Select Advanced >> PPP Location3. Select Bridged Mode (PPPoE is not used), then Change PPP Location4. When prompted, restart the DSL modem5. Login to your router (for me, it's 192.168.1.1)6. Under Setup> Basic Setup >> Internet Connection Type, select PPPoE and enter the DSL login & password info you normally would enter in your DSL modem to authenticate your DSL service.7. At this point, the \"bridging\" should have been successful.  To check that bridging has been successful, click Status >> Router, and check that you are \"connected\" with an IP address showing.  If successful, you should also see that your DSL modem's \"internet\" LED light is off while your router's \"internet\" light is on.  What you basically have done is to move the point of authentication for your DSL service from the DSL modem to your router; your DSL modem merely acts as a bridge for the DSL service to your router.8. Now, we move on to configuring the camera itself.  I assume that the camera has already been configured for wired and wireless mode.  Login to the network camera (for me it's, 192.168.1.253).9. Click Setup.  Change the Port No. from the default of 80 to 50000 (fifty thousand) and enter the IP address of the camera (for me, it's 192.168.1.253).  Click Save, and the camera will restart.  When it finishes restarting (taking as long as 1.5 min), it'll bring you back to the \"Top\" home page of the camera config screen.10. Log back into your router, and go to Applications & Gaming, where you'll be able to set up port forwarding.11. In the Port Range, enter 50000 as \"Start\" and 50000 as \"End.\"  Enter the IP Address of the camera (for me, 192.168.1.253).  Check Enable.  Save Settings.12. Now, log back into your camera.  Go to Setup >> DynamicDNS.  Select viewnetcam-dot-com, then Next.13. Click on \"Your Account Link\" to bring up the viewnetcam.com registration page, where you then select New Registration.  Enter your desired registration info and select your domain name at viewnetcam-dot-com (e.g. yourname-dot-viewnetcam-dot-com). Click Choose.14. Now, you will be shown a page confirming your registration.  Under DDNS status, you will see Active-waiting.  You need to wait up to 10min as the domain registration occurs, at which time, the status will change to Active.15. We're almost done; stay with me!  From WinXP Start Menu, click Run and type \"cmd\" to bring up a DOS window.16. In the DOS window, type \"ipconfig/all\", which shows your computer's various network information.  Under Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection, copy down the two addresses under DNS Servers.17. Log back into your camera, select Setup, and enter the 2 DNS Server addresses from ipconfig/all in the 2 DNS boxes.18. Go back to viewnetcam-dot-com, login to your account, and check that the DDNS status is now Active. If so, then you're all ready to go!19.

In my view, this is the ONLY way cameras should be used due to the unstable PC connected solutions (e.g., PC freeze-up, lost power, etc).  It is an IP based system which needs its own local internet address which the included software does a pretty good job setting up automatically.MY EXPERIENCESI have tried over 20 wireless web cameras from 7 brands over the last 5 years ($100-$600) and none are close to the performance, reliability, ease of setup of the Panasonic cams for a consumer based product.  Dlink used to lead the pack until the BL-C20A/30A units came out.  I was a fan of Dlinks but the software setup, remote camera configurations, and Viewnetcam dynamic DNS service of the the Pana's is just the best today.ADVANTAGES- The included software is the best on the market for finding the camera on your system and trying to configure it automatically.  Most software engineers should be SHOT due to sloppy code but the Panasonic software and firmware (software inside the cameras) is pretty good for setup and reliability (I am an electrical engineer so I know the sloppy way most of these guys think).- Tech support for Panasonic is the ONLY support I have contacted from 7 brands with AMERICANS speaking ENGLISH (not \"Engrish\").  Their patience and overall knowledge is truly outstanding and worth every extra penny this camera costs.- I highly recommend you also buy the Panasonic wireless router.  It automatically configures with the cameras and becomes really easy to find/control the cameras.- The ability to reset/reconfigure the cameras remotely is INVALUABLE!  I am often travleing in China, at my home in Chicago, or my home in Florida and want to make changes.  I can do it remotely with 100% success after the first setup.  I was even able to configure some cams in Chicago and Fedex to my wife in Florida and they booted up into the other system perfectly!- The Viewnetcam dynamic DNS service is stunningly reliable.  It has never gone down and my cameras reset/refind themselves every hour so if your local ISP dynamically changes your IP address (Comcast is worst) you are always going to have the cams back up in 1 hour.- The ability to snap images, group small video screens, and \"mouse-point\" the cameras via the pan-tilt-zoom are outstanding.- The built in microphones are AMAZINGLY sensitive and pick up small noises remarkably well.  I could hear the kids playing outside the house with cams inside.- The built in multi-screen servers can integrate different models of cameras.  For example, I use a BL-C131A cam as #1 at my mom's house for PTZ and audio.  I then add a BL-C30A for simple PTZ photo/video and a BL-C20A for fixed photo/video.  They all coexist in one screen and work beautifully!- The photo snaps work PERFECTLY for building a simple web page and placing multiple screen snaps on 1 page (I placed 8) thus a super slim matrix of what is happening in my homes.  Each photo at 320x240 is only 8kb so they download fast.- The mobile function (viewing on a cell phone browser) works INCREDIBLY well.  I use it everyday on my Treo700P via Sprint.DISADVANTAGES/CAUTIONS- ANY web cam is tedious to setup, no matter the brand.  Be patient, and call Pana's tech support before returning the unit.- DON'T expect HD quality video - these are 640x480 screens as best and the upload speed of your home network will always be the limiting factor.  I do not recommend more than 4 cams online at once since this overloads even a good 768K upload system.- The pan-tilt controls are outstanding.  Lots of left-right-down travel but up is limited.  Also, the zoom is a digital zoom (NOT an optical zoom) thus very pixelated and not worth much.- The cams can fight for packets and \"burble\" your VOIP telephone calls.SUMMARYOutstanding product.  I now own 14 units around the world and all are stone-cold reliable.  Just great products.", "Date": "January 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "It works as advertised", "Author": "LS", "ReviewID": "R1H6Z1SP31DML2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have experience with D-Link cameras, and this one is much better.

Easy enough to set up, full of features that took a little bit to learn, but now easy enough to use. I especially like that the cam can store something like 130 images in time and in motion detect buffers (depends on image size). Once you set these up it is cool to look back in time and see what happened. Motion detect is configurable in many ways, as is the periodic timer. I have not tried multiple cams yet, but you can configure one IP address to access several cameras they say. I just ordered a second camera. The microphone is very sensitive - awesome.

The picture is not the greatest, but it is good enough.  You can still read a car's license plate or recognize a person's face from the images. What I like about them is how easy they are to monitor and control remotely, how they email images when they detect motion, and how affordable they are.  The cameras are very reliable.  I have had one for almost a year and it has never stopped working or lost connection or anything like that.I have them both inside, facing the outside through a glass window, one facing the front yard and the other one facing the back yard.  I use a mini \"spider\" tripot to hang them on the window.  I have the sound turned off on both.  I have the motion detection turn on.  They send me emails with images when they detect motion. I have an email account created exclusively for this.  They do not have night vision, but that is not a problem for me since I also have motion lights in the front and back of the house.  The images and video are recorded on the memory inside the camera, and it can be overwritten when the camera runs out of memory space, but I have the images emailed to me so I still get those images that get overwritten in the camera.Each camera comes with a web based software that allows you to monitor and control the camera.  Panasonic offers a free service that allows me to monitor multiple cameras at the same time remotely, using Internet Explorer.  The first thing I do when I get to work is log on to this service so that I can monitor my home front and back from work.  Each camera is password protected.  So nobody can access your cameras even if they know the URL, unless they also know the user id and password.You can download firmware updates from the Panasonic website.The only problem I see with this camera is that the software uses Activex Controls.  So the software works only with Internet Explorer and I don't think it will work with other web browsers such as FireFox.  This is not a problem for me since I don't mind using IE, but I can see where this might bother other people.

Good resolution, features, and FREE internet access.  (By-the-way, you need a router.) It is a no-brainer to set up to use in your home or office.

There are just too many conflicts to do yourself.  But don't worry.  Once you have their number, its a breeze and takes only about 10 minutes!  Okay, world, here is their direct tech line:  800-272-7033.  If you are somewhat savvy, here is one important tip for internet access:  set your port # at 5000.  Now, if you have DSL (not cable broadband) you will most likely need to make a second call...to your DSL tech people.  The problem is that DSL modems have a built in router which needs to be set for \"bridge mode\" which turns off the internal router.  You can't have two routers in the same line and get this to work over the web.  And you don't have their secret codes to control their modem.  Again, no problem.  Took about 5 minutes once I had them on the phone (they are used to this issue and well practiced).Again, hope this is helpful.

On the surface the product works well, the picture and audio are fine.  The external viewing capability is not as easy to get working as other reviewers have indicated, so that is still on my to-do list.  The major problem i have with the camera is the fact that it hogs my wifi network and interferes with server-to-server connections I have at home.  I am in the middle of copying a whole bunch of files from one PC to another, then I turn on this camera and the connection is lost.  Also, if the camera is running and showing a picture and audio is coming in normally, then I start to do something else on the network (not necessarily on the wifi network) the picture will freeze and the camera no longer responds.  I have lost track of the number of times I have had to restart the camera.  I have upgraded the firmware, reset to factory settings and have not found a solution yet.  I am a day or two away from giving up and sending this camera back and going with another vendor.  I will update the review if I find out what the problem is later.  If I could get passed this issue, I'm sure I would love the camera and give it 5 stars.--Update:  I fumbled around with the settings a little more and have managed to get everything working.  It seemed that I had an IP conflict with two other devices on my network that was somehow causing the camera to freeze - since I have resolved that the camera has never stopped.  Also somehow the internet viewing capability is now working too, although I am unable to move the camera when viewing it remotely - I get \"error on page\" when using the navigation buttons.

After searching the web it looked like this was the camera to get.  The decision was based on the quality of the image and the high praise for the U.S. based help center that they provided while you are setting up the camera.  After a few blitches and calls to the help center I was up and running and very happy.  Then the camera died with a blinking red light.  I finally got around to calling the service center help desk. It is now located in Jamaica and the phone connection was poor and there was a real language barrier.  After some trouble shooting, I basically was politely told that the camera was defective and that I should return it by tracked mail to their service center in Georgia.  The camera was still under warranty and I sent it off priority mail.  In less than a week I got a call from the Panasonic Service Center in Georgia and I could hardly understand the technician on the other end of the line as his foreign accent and poor English were distracting.  He said it had a water spot and the warranty was void.  When I talked to his supervisor (also foreign and next to impossible to understand) I was told that there was a spot on a circuit board from a water droplet and that the warranty was therefore void.  I asked him about a possible repair and he said it would cost more to replace it than for me to buy a new camera.  I asked that the camera be returned to me and that they should leave it unassembled so that I could see the spot.  They marked the spot with a marker pin.....at best a faint dull colored area of apparent corrosion on a thin metal strip on the board half way inside the camera.  There was no indication of any water having been inside the camera and the area of corrosion was towards the center back of the camera and not near the small openings on the bottom of the case where water might have entered.  Best I can tell, it could have been a point of inside condensation due to high humidity.

Apparently Panasonic considers a product good even if it will take weeks to get it to work as specified.This a a very complicated product and I would suggest that unless you able or willing to spend time tweaking your router, configuring the camera, and on the phone to Panasonic that you wait until they are more plug and play.  There is a reason Panasonic has knowledgeable tech support - lots of install problems!Addendum: 5/14/09 - Product is finally working and meets my expectations.  I called Panasonic after waiting a week for the camera's previous registration to be cleared (this prevented online use).  The support person indicated that the camera had been cleared and proceeded to help me setup online access.  I'm not sure why I never received an email saying the camera was ready.  I was also told that I was quoted 2-3 weeks because Panasonic Japan (server location) was scheduled for a 1-week shut-down for holiday.  Normally the camera registration can be cleared in 2-3 days.  The original support person should have said that - he  made it sound like 2-3 weeks was standard processing time.I'm very satisfied with the camera but still believe that to configure the camera/router for online access will require panasonic support for most users.", "Date": "May 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent hardware and tech support, terrible documentation", "Author": "Captain Uncle", "ReviewID": "R31YS5PYDN1CG8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Have this system now completely functional.

No problems at all running well over 3 years now.Update: I previously rated this 3 stars because I thought it was expensive. But after checking out other cams in the same price range I realized this is the best thing out there. Mine has been running for almost a year 24/7 and no problems!The features and support are the best.----------------------------------------------I have a network with several computers and a couple of servers. Setting up the camera is a bit more complex than connecting straight to a dsl or cable modem. There is the modem, the router/firewall, wireless router and then computers, servers and the camera. Configuration for the camera is actually done at the router even though communication is through the wireless. I have had it for a month now, it works great and I can view it through the Internet.I have my camera pointing out a window to the front of our house. The image isn't bad close in. You can definitely tell what is in view. But things get fuzzy with distance. At 30 feet or more you will have a tough time telling who it is. But up to a couple hundred feet you can still tell if it is human. Beyond that it is pretty much useless except for a house or car - you won't be able to make identification for anything smaller.I was hoping to be able to see what weather was coming but the sky is always white. Overall the image tends to be a bit bright even with adjustments. On a day of slight drizzle you couldn't tell at all. When it snowed you could tell something was happening. You can see the snow on the ground in front of the house.At night our porch is well lit and that is all you can see, about 30 feet of it. So if someone was messing around beyond that there won't be much evidence. It does pick up headlights as cars drive by - I didn't realize just how busy our street was!The camera can store video or images, images can be transfered (ftp) to a computer. There are five trigger options. However, you can only get ten seconds of video which is not much. So I have all five set to take images (about 3 per second) at different times of the day and ftp them to a computer.Motion detection works very well, maybe too well - I get 10 to 20 thousand images a day. I need to play around with the sensitivity. Sensor detection however did not work well for me at all. Maybe because it is near the window and it gets confused.I recently left town for a week with my netbook. I found a wireless connection and could check my house via the camera - it was awesome! The sound quality is also incredible. I called the house and could hear the phone, located in a different room, as if it were right next to the camera (otherwise there wasn't much going on - thank God!).Panasonic has great support.

That falls short of the WVC200, which can email an MPEG-4 clip when triggered. Another seemingly obvious oversight is the inability to turn off all activity lights. While there's an option to turn off the power light, it completely ignores control of the light that blinks when it is supposed to inconspicuously detect motion.As another reviewer wrote, the author of the manual is clearly not a native English speaker, which prompts the question of why a company the size of Panasonic couldn't run it by anyone state side, who would have immediately caught things like: \"Encryption is a help to avoid being read the data within wireless LAN by others.\" and more. Finally the bundled software only includes a Web based monitor, (which seems to require repeated installations of the ActiveX applets for MPEG-4 and MJPEG players), while the Linksys supplies a fully functional desktop monitor application, with recording schedules and archive playback, (but no scheduled motion detection), although only for a PC.Non-PC users might find this among their better options as it does function, (without audio), in non-IE browsers, including Safari, and Panasonic has far better tech support than Linksys, but PC users might find a better interface in the Linksys.", "Date": "July 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Product -- Lots of Features", "Author": "Goldrush", "ReviewID": "R23WKZJGQ7ENXR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I installed this product a couple of days ago and I am thrilled with it.

Setup is very easy once the camera is discovered, but you must know your wireless SSID and security settings if you are going to use this in the wireless mode (also remember to set the switch on the bottom when finished).Once the basic setup is complete, the setup for remote Internet viewing next. The scary part of K. Lam's walk-through was not needed as the camera software took care of the port forwarding by talking directly to the router and then connected me to the viewnetcam website for registration. Once that was complete, I had my own easy to remember URL for viewing and controlling my camera. Total setup time was about 30 minutes and no calls to the tech support line were required.You connect to the camera via your standard browser (IE 7, Safari, and Firefox worked fine) so no proprietary software is required.

You must turn it on yourself.-If you have a router plugged into a router, like you might with Verizon because their router is quite possibly the worst one I have ever used in my entire life, the Verizon router will block the incoming request to use the camera from the internet.  You'll just get the Verizon router login instead of the camera.-If you have a Verizon FIOS router, don't even try to use it wirelessly unless you have no encryption, or WEP only.  WPA or WPA2 don't work, but you may know this about Verizon routers from your laptop or really ANY other wireless device you've tried to connect to it.-Connecting to the internet required 2 steps, setting up the \"Internet\" section, and then setting up the \"DNS\" in Setup.  If these were combined, it would be a bit easier to configure, but it still wasn't hard and you only have to do it once.

The exact pan angle is described in the spec as 100\u00b0, so a tad more than a quarter of a turn.

Before I bought the camera, I did an extensive research on mid-level, wireless cameras, and liked Panasonic BL-C131A the best. (The reviews of \"$100-or-less wireless cameras\" didn't sound promising at least in the long run with burnt-out lenses, or frequent reset requirement etc.) This Panasonic camera seemed somehow pricey and from the reviews the set-up to access the video remotely sounded pretty complicated.After one month of use, I am very happy with the camera's performance, it's well worth the money. The set-up turned out to be much easier than I thought. I have a Linksys WRT54G2 Wireless router connected to my DSL router. My DSL connection has a dynamic IP number. This configuration should be pretty common. The set-up instructions were for this kind of configuration and easy to follow, very straight forward. I should note, that I upgraded the firmware, as soon as I had access to the camera, since some of the bug fixes etc sounded applicable to my set-up. The upgrade was easy and straight forward as well.The free, built-in dynamic-DNS service (through viewnetcam.com) works great. The streaming video and audio can be accessed over the Internet, but for the audio I need to use Internet Explorer since Sharp G.726 codec is needed. Windows Media Player on Windows XP comes with this codec and IE works great. I couldn't make Firefox work with this codec, so no audio with Firefox. Windows Vista may not come with this particular codec, but it is easy to find the free codec and install it.My wife uses her Blackberry to access the camera remotely. It is still-images only without audio. One needs to keep refreshing the image!I mounted the camera on the wall; it comes with all the necessary screws etc. The long, thin, black power cable running over the wall looks ugly, I've yet to find a way of hiding it.I like and use the following features:- Enable/Disable the green indicator light on the camera.- Enable/Disable the privacy mode.- Set timings for the camera to be active.- Pan and tilt and pre-set lens locations work great, but it is kinda noisy. In a quiet room, one can easily hear the lens moving around.- Creating users and granting different permissions for remote access are neat. As an administrator, one can see who is logged in.The standard setting of the microphone is pretty good. The room where the camera is located is well to OK lit most of the time, so video, colors etc. are fine for me. I read that the motion detection may be tricky.

The camera works as advertised.  I eventually set it up on my network successfully - I thought I would add a few things I learned.The setup is straightforward.  You do not need the disc that comes with it or a Windows computer.  You plug the camera into the ethernet of the router with the switch on the camera on 'wired'.You have to find the IP address of the camera.  Click on the apple in the top right of your screen>About this Mac>More Info..>Network  Now scroll down to DNS:Server address.  (Mine is 10.0.1.1)  The address of the camera will change the last number to 253.  So for mine, it is 10.0.1.253  -  Now type [...] into your browser and you should find the camera.  If you have other cameras on the network, the last number might be lower (252, 251, etc).So you set up the camera - give it a name and password.  You have to type in the SSID of your wireless network.  This is the name you see when you get on the network on a laptop or your phone.  It must typed in exactly.  Then you have to pick the encryption type - I choose \"WPA2-PSK(AES)\".  This is where I got hung up.I use an Airport Extreme.  If you do - open Airport Utility, click Manual Setup>Wireless.  I had the Wireless Security set on \"WPA/WPA2 Personal\" (which Apple recommends).  This would not let the camera connect, though.  So I changed the wireless security to \"WPA2 Personal.\"  And then hit 'Update'.  For whatever reason, this did the trick, and the camera connected.After these settings, you unplug the camera, disconnect the ethernet cable from it, and switch the camera to 'wireless' - then plug it back in.  With any luck, you can connect your browser to the address you used for it when it was wired.I have not configured the camera to connect to the internet yet.  It sounds like it might be a little more involved with the Airport Extreme settings, but if I get bored, I'll try that.I do not get sound from the camera using the Macs - I don't care, but you might.

Perhaps those who where not happy with support should have hung up and called back.  I needed to do that a few times.2) All home monitoring camera's perform poorly in low light conditions regardless of the brand.  Bottom line: No light, no picture.  Some do better than others obviously in lower light conditions, but there is a general threshold in the evening where you must turn on the lights for the camera to operate.3) I have found no problem logging into and using the panasonic site (viewnetcam).  It has worked seamlessly for me and provides password security which has been just fine.4) The camera does have 10x digital zoom capability - use the scroll capability on your mouse if available.  Needed to do a web search to understand how to use this feature.Cons:1) There is NO ability to attach an external speaker, nor is there a speaker integrated with the camera.  When we were on vacation, our cat would come to the camera for the first week when we connected - must have been some mechanical noise the cat picked up.

Based on reviews on Amazon from customers, this was my first choice to monitor my property from an upstairs window.This camera works on both Wifi as well as wired networks.  It can viewed and controlled by a web browser or by dedicated software (more on this topic later).  It supports automatic UPnP setup of your router, and Panasonic runs a [...] service to support DDNS, giving you the ability to give your camera a URL so you can access your camera anywhere in the world you get internet service.Setup is really easy.  The camera functions as a mini-server and walks you through the setup with no software necessary to load on your PC.  Thus, the need for software at this point is minimal (activex control for IE, or Java for other browsers).  Panasonic does supply some 3rd party software which has been limited in functionality.  This software may be fine, but won't work on a Mac, nor does it work in a 64 bit version of windows (it crashes pretty much right away).  In addition, the software can be unlocked to support multiple cameras for several hundred dollars. Yikes.  Instead, I would look for low-cost 3rd party software (such as from H264soft) that does pretty much the same thing, but is far more robust.The camera is extremely flexible allowing you to view in real time or push still pictures via email, HTTP, or FTP based on events such as motion or time.  Thus, it can serve as a remote warning to you if the camera detects motion.Image quality in daylight or artificial light is excellent, and in 640x480 mode, the image is really very nice.  This is not a great camera for night time use.  It simply doesn't produce much of an image after the sun goes does.Physically, the camera gets a bit warm, so that is a concern for long-term reliability, but I've left it running continuously for about 5 days with no issues.  A very nice touch is that Panasonic provides a cable loop to allow you to fasten the camera so it can't be removed easily and it serves as a guard if it does fall from a ledge it will avoid damage to the camera.When I got the camera, I had a slight issue with viewnetcam, so I called Panasonic late in the evening.  After less than a 30 second wait I got in touch with a technician who not only spoke perfect English, but was extremely helpful and got the problem solved within 5 minutes.  Excellent customer service seems to be an exception these days, so Panasonic deserves kudos for this.This camera is excellent.  It's one of those products that seems a little expensive, but in reality actually surprises with how well-designed it is.

Things are working great now, but I fought the instructions and support every step of the way.First off...I didn't really know what I was getting...the description on the Amazon web page is simply incomplete.  How is the thing powered?  There is no way to tell from the description.  It turns out that the unit has a mobile phone style power adapter with a black cord.  So the idea I guess is to mount the camera on the wall and plug it into a nearby outlet with the unsightly black cord trailing down the wall.Second the 16 camera recording software did not work on my Vista 64 laptop.  I wrote support and they responded that Vista 64 is not supported.  Oh really?  How was I supposed to know that?  The single camera software works.  The 16 camera software appears to be the same software with a different license...so I think there is some easily solvable problem...support needs to get their head out of their butt.  A lot of new hardware uses 64 bit OSes.  I was suprised to find out that the 16 camera recording software works on Windows Home Server, which is basically windows server 2003.  This does not appear to be supported either.Finally the instructions are reasonably complete but complicated...the garbled English is really an impediment in this case.  Here is an example description for Sensor deactivation time: \"After the sensor detecting, until the time when it is appointed it elapses, because the next sensor detection is not done, there is a possibility where you cannot acquire the picture.\"  Whatever is this saying?But it is a great camera.  A full webserver on each camera so you do not need to rely on installed software.  You simply point a browser to it.  First you connect to the camera with a Ethernet cable (note:  not provided) to set up the wireless.  You have a login/password for each camera.

I did not assign it a static IP and it worked very well with my linksys DHCP.  I manually forwarded an external port to the CAM's IP and port 80 and had no problem accessing it from an IPGONE on 3G.  Since the web session is always active, it can (and did) drain IPHONE's battery in about 2 hours!  It has nice and operational pan, tilt, center, zoom features. the zoom will not adjust the focus and thus it is a but blurry at max.

I needed a wireless camera because I don't have ethernet wire in the room where he is, and I needed one that did not require a computer to be left on all day.  After reading the reviews I decided to spend more for this model.Setup was relatively painless and I did not need to call tech support (my experience level -- not a pro by any means but have installed other network devices like routers, network storage, network printers).  However the internet did not work till I tried changing the port to 50000 and specifying fixed IP address as recommended by a couple people who posted here. (THANKS!)I would agree the video quality is not fabulous but it's adequate for my purposes.  Has not noticeably slowed down my network and I have not had any trouble accessing the webcam through the web.  It's really nice to be able to move the camera remotely since the dog moves around.One feature I really like is that you can set it several times a day (triggered by motion or a specific time) to take a snapshot and either save and write over these every day or e-mail the picture to you.  You can also set various user levels and specify whether the user can move the camera, hear sound, change settings, etc.I would agree the user manual is close to useless and for some reason that I can't figure out from the manual the indicator light blinks orange instead of green (or red in \"privacy mode).  However I can live with that  so haven't spent much time troubleshooting it.*UPDATE*July 2009After a year and a half the unit is still functioning flawlessly.  It handled the upgrade to a wireless N router with a much longer password just fine.  After my disabled dog passed away, I relocated the camera to the entryway.  While on vacation, I got a text message from my alarm system that there was an issue with the front door.  Took a look and sure enough -- the front door was wide open! The alarm had not actually triggered, so I would have ignored the text (and the neighbors would never have known there was an issue) if I wasn't able to see the door open.

Linksys) in the past, I researched and compared other pan/tilt/zoom cameras before finally arriving at the BL-C131A.  While the one I purchased was used, it still worked like a charm, and from what I can tell went through the same setup steps that a brand new device would.Originally, I hooked it into my wired LAN so I could access-then-configure it via the software, and while it took a minute or two to find, once it was discovered the rest of the setup was a breeze.  It's now wirelessly connected downstairs to my Linksys WRT300N upstairs, and has been going strong for days.  I often log in from work just to check on things at home, and make sure nothing's amiss.While cool, it also is hopefully going to help serve as a nannycam.  The main challenge in doing that is that I cannot record video easily to my website (for review at end of day).  This is a major downer for me, but the ease of use and fantastic pan/tilt/zoom features make up for the loss (while I'm looking for solutions).All in all, it's a great cam which fits the needs I've got now, and hopefully will work for my future needs as well.

Panasonic could have made this camera where setup could be done 100% by a web browser, just like a Linksys router.

If you're not very computer savvy, I recommend calling customer support. The camera works flawlessly. I love the programmability of the features such as panning to certain areas and timed activation or motion detection activation. Zoom is digital so don't expect perfection out of it. The delay from camera to my screen at work is only about 2 to 3 seconds which is about as good as you can get with an IP camera. My only complaint is that I wish it was a 2-way speaker but I'm happy with at least being able to hear noise in the house. The mic isn't fantastic but it does the job for what I need. The image is a little grainy but you can identify faces easily enough and the police can take your image and increase the detail if they need to.All in all a great buy at 270 bucks. If you're buying more than one, be prepared to pay an extra 300 bucks for an IP camera router which is also sold here. I may upgrade to that soon. I also recommend at least 300k upload speed for one camera at 640x480 resolution. Initially my upload was at about 150k and the camera lagged badly at 640x480 and even lagged in 320x240 resolution. After I upgraded my connection, it worked fine in both modes.

I put a big-number-thermometer in there and we can easily read it.  The audio works suprisingly well.

The record GUI had problems installing but once I self installed MPEG4 it worked like a champ.Overall this camera has been stable and is probably the best on the market.

I read many reviews of people having issues setting up the wireless connection, but I found it to be very simple after discovering the keys to it - My NetGear wireless N router is set in B/G mode and you must set the cameras to B/G as well or they will not connect.  Also, even though it tells you to turn the camera off and unplug the wired connection, DON'T, just flip the switch and then pull the cable.  Works like a charm and connects every time thereafter.Setting them up for outside access via Comcast was a breeze - admittedly I am a network engineer so I have done this for a living for 15 years, but even for me this was easy.  The sound quality and image quality are both exactly what I expected (The sound is actually MUCH better than expected - I can hear the dog door in the basement from the camera on the second floor).  For all those who said the image quality was poor - what did you really expect?  It is not like these are HD cameras...Bandwidth usage did not seem to be horrible - my wife and I were both watching the cameras at the same time with only the expected transmission delay and no choppiness or unresponsiveness from the cameras or the display page.  Zooming is a little funky - my wife finally discovered that what the zoom directions are trying to say is that you hold down the right mouse button AND use the scroll wheel to zoom.  However I could not see her zoomed in picture while watching - not that it is a big deal, but just something to be aware of.I will definitely be adding to my camera setup, the multi-camera support is embedded into the cameras themselves so you only need to set up one to see all of them which is a nice feature for sure.  I did not care about recording since this is more for real-time monitoring of kids and pets, but there are many simple and free recording software packages available that would simply integrate with these cameras.In short the price premium is definitely there, but the product more than backs it up by delivering great usability and performance with simple and hassle-free setup to boot.

I tried about everything I could think of (in addition to what was in the documentation).  After a few hours, I did get it working, but I am still not sure what made it happen.  Perhaps the camera was snooping on my internet connection and saw I was searching Amazon to figure out how to return it.

And here's the real crappy part...It can take up to 5 days to get the cameras account cleared because Panasonic has to notify a company in China.  Had I known this I wouldn't have bought a refurbished camera.  I now also see that a new BL-C131A camera can cost around $400 on Amazon.  I just saw these same cameras at Best Buy for $239 the other day.  Maybe I should save myself the trouble and buy from a local store so that if there's a problem I can return it immediately and get my money back without having to deal with shipping returns and companies like \"Good As New Electronics\" who want a 15% restocking fee for the return of defective products.Can't say how the camera preforms through the Internet because I'm stuck waiting for the old account to be reset.I spent over 8 hours trying to make this work before finding out this problem, so I'm rather pissed about it.Panasonic needs to be able to expedite this account clearing issue.

Panasonic said it was a defective camera.  I bought this camera from \"Good As New Electronics\" and they won't give a refund without charging me a 15% restocking fee.  They only offered an exchange, so I excepted another refurbished camera.  After waiting more than a week I received the replacement camera and guess what?

I'm still waiting...Update: 08-09-2010:Still waiting for the camera to be cleared from the view cam net . com website.  The 5 days have come and gone. I called Panasonic and they said give it another day...Update: 08-10-2010:Old account still not cleared, so I called Panasonic again this morning.

I've had enough.  I told the rep skip it the cameras going back to the seller \"Good As New Electronics\".  Kind of a oxymoron isn't it?This camera (BL-C131A) got 4 stars and was highly rated so I'm a little perplexed. I started to look more at the reviews with 1 and 2 stars and that revealed some important issues.  Even if I finally got the Internet portion of the camera working I'd still be concerned if the camera would last.  I read a lot about the camera working fine and than suddenly not working anymore.  Sometimes this happens within 3 months and sometimes after a year.  The first one I bought crapped out after only three days. It seems to be hit and miss.

Even with the camera hard wired into the local network video quality was marginal at best- it looked like a zoomed 320x240 video, or worse.Color was poor, even in a decently lit room... Contrast was also extremely poor- I'm not sure what is the ideal setting for this camera- too dark and you see nothing, but with a bright light the image is washed out.The install software is primitive, definitely not optimized.On the plus side I was able to set it up relatively easily and got it connected to the Internet without having to call Panasonic tech support, something many other reviewers complained about.The power cord is also on the short side- for a security camera I'd expect a much longer cord.Overall I'd say skip this camera...

I experienced a range of helpfulness from the support folks I dealt with, from smart/helpful to (in one case) rude.At the end of the day, I got all the features to work save the one that (in my view) is the only one that matters -- the posting of \"triggered\" images to a web server.I don't care to go online and see what my camera is seeing. That's neat and fun but not particularly useful to me. I want to see a \"highlight film\" of everything *important* that the camera saw that day, such as people passing by, whatever (you define important by programming the sensors). The camera is designed for this, given all the clever sensors, including a heat sensor to detect people or animals entering the room.The closest I came, however, was to get the camera to blast out a burst of images to an email address every time it was triggered. But who wants to open 500 emails to see if one of them contains whatever it is you're hoping to see? I thought about hiring a programmer to write a script to extract the images from the emails and composite them into a movie, but that felt like an expensive and frustratingly unnecessary project to have to undertake to fix a flaw in this product's design.Stumped after umpteen hours of playing with this, I gave up and the thing has sat in a drawer unused. I'm not sure what other people use it for but in my case (hoping to find who was stealing from a particular spot), it came so close, but ultimately didn't deliver.What is needed is an end-to-end, easy-to-use solution that lets you set certain parameters and then watch a \"movie\" of all the triggered images.

Well, worked ok from MS Internet Explorer (Firefox had trouble with audio). Blackberry doesn't work at all and Iphone worked with some obvius limitations.UPDATE - Some people asked me how to solve the browser hanging problem with this camera. While this has been long time and I don't remember 100% the reasons, I think that the camera streaming created too big packages that many routers had problem dealing with. I know my router was set to 1200 bytes MTU size to fix the problem, but I don't remember if I did something else.A couple days ago, all the suden I can not longer acces the camera via wi-fi, wired still works. The status diagnostics show a hardware error:  0000-0000-0000-0000-0000-0000-0002-0000-00 (front led blinking red)This all points to the hardware for the Wi-Fi. Thinking that I am out of warranty for a couple months, and according to the web a wi-fi assembly pcb cost nearly the cost of the camera plus... then add labor, shipping, etc... Sadly, I am thinking this camera wi-fi days are over!On top of this, the \"smart\" engineers (or perhaps marketing people) behind this design, made the front red LED blinking continusly on red while there is a hardware trouble, overiding other really practical funtionality as alerting you when somebody is connected. In other words, thanks to this flaw I can not longer know when sombody is connected, no question a mayor bummer! Also, when you want to leave the led off to avoid alarming your nanny that is being watch, is gone (the led is always blinking).I tried cheat the camera (with some risk) using the firmare for the BL-C111 that don't have wi-fi, so I could recover my LED indicator functionality, but no luck, the firmare looks the same.

The wireless camera went in my living room, aimed at my plasma TV and entertainment system.Despite me paying a large wad of cash to Circuit City, the FireDog left my residence telling me everything was OK (despite he never seemed to know what he was doing while he was at my house) and he told me I could now watch my house on the internet when I went to London by using my laptop and clicking on the bookmark he saved on my computer. I decided to conduct a test before leaving for the United Kingdom.  I couldn't even see my place from Starbucks, 50 miles away when I took my laptop to \"the big city.\"  I tried Starbucks, a public library and a free WiFi source at a local university... NO CAMERAS!

In fact, he had to make two trips (200 MILES) to my place to tweak the system. I was able to watch my house from both London, England and Edinburgh, Scotland...

Well, I had a youngster from our church come by our house to feed our dogs and check on things. Each time she came through the door, I received hundreds of e-mails. This was a pain deleting thousands of e-mails from my cell phone while in England. BUT, it was very cool being able to see stored video clips of her when I received the e-mail alerts. (I mean it was totally, TOTALLY impressive to be in my hotel room in London and see what was going on in my house, basically in real-time and through saved video clips!)A few months later after I returned from England, I can no longer see the cameras on the internet. I don't know why the link quit, but I'll have to hire some guy to come back out  here (nearly 100 miles round trip) to fix, what ever is wrong. (My original \"rocket-scientist\" from Circuit City took another job somewhere... and I have to give this guy some credit, he did a wonderful job, I just wish I knew where he went so I could pay him to fix my system... )The process in getting these cameras up-and-running on the internet (so you access them) is very, VERY DIFFICULT unless you are a super-gifted geek. Heck, I think a CIA geek would have a hard time getting these cameras to work (faithfully) as advertised! Yes, you can call Panasonic and get their tech guy to help you setting up the cameras, BUT, you have to speak GEEK to understand what in the world you have to do to get these cameras on the internet.I can fly an airplane at night, in rain, by myself to any point in the world (I am a GPS freek) but I sure can't figure out these cameras! And, I spent 25 years in TELEVISION and taught television at a private university (although this was in my analog years...)I'm probably going to sell mine on Ebay in a couple of weeks... I give up.

The FAQ section is written in bloken Engrish and doesn't address the issue. I tried to download a troubleshooting guide and it said the document I requested is not available electronically. To purchase a copy, please call 1-800....So despite all that, I finally got it working wirelessly inside my home LAN. Registered with viewnetcam.com and everything. And it worked great from my house. It even worked on my iPhone over wifi. But it didn't work at all from my dad's house, my father-in-law's house, my brother-in-law's work or Coffee Plantation wifi. So I waited a day and now it doesn't work from my house either.

It IS NOT PLUG and PLAY!!!  You have to have knowledge of how to configure a router, IP addresses, Default Gateways, port forwarding, bridging, etc.  I followed reviews here on Amazon, the limited instructions included, the manual on the disk and though I could see the video on my laptop, I couldn't see it on the website.Customer support was great in that we went through all the settings, in which I had done correctly, and when it came to my Hughesnet modem, I was dead in the water.  It has one IP address coming in and one going out, which are not static so you can't set the camera up unless you can get Hughesnet to give you a static IP address.Since I wasn't going to use it at my home anyway I felt comfortable knowing at least I could see it on the laptop.  It worked great locally, wired and wireless.  As a just in case, I purchased another laptop, with Windows 7, and made sure the camera worked wired and wireless from that laptop. I then installed remote access software on my laptop and the new laptop so I could remote in and fix any problems after the camera wasn't in my control.  All was working great, except the advanced features that come along with the web stuff.  And then I sent the equipment home with my daughter......My daughter took the laptop, router and camera to her home and turned everything except the router on, as a test, before moving.  Because her internet provider provides a wireless modem or router (which has a password), she didn't need the NetGear router.  It does require a password to get on the network.So now the camera can't be accessed.  It's possible the router/modem there has screwed the camera settings up but the camera can't be accessed to change it's settings to match the router.  Putting in the disk and selecting automatic under network settings, does nothing except change the IP address and port number. Setting the camera back to port 5000 and the IP address I had does nothing, IF the camera can be accessed.  The camera recording software won't show a picture. I can't use IE or Firefox to use the bookmark I set up to get to the camera because it can't find the camera.  I have it wired into the new laptop and can't get to the camera to change the settings.  I tried to load the file I had saved with the settings that worked at my house and can't access the camera.  Rebooting, going wireless, wired or whatever doesn't work.  The disk nor the loaded software can access the camera.So I have yet to see a picture on the internet, much less use the advanced settings.  Changing to another location screwed up the camera so that it can't be accessed to change settings.  I'm dead in the water. I'm bringing it back to my house this weekend to see if I can at least access it again being away from her internet providers router/modem.  If the camera would at least work, like at my house, I could remote in to that pc and still watch camera video.So now I'm scrambling to find another camera to serve my purpose.  I may just say forget it and use Skype and the webcam.  We tested that method too and it works great, and it's free.  If you want a free camera, you've probably already got one.  Just create 2 gmail email addresses (or an additional one if you already have one), get a Skype account under each email account, use either Windows Remote or get a free remote program like GBridge, point your laptop in the direction you want to see, set the Skype on the remote computer to start when the computer comes on (it asks you when you set it up) and set GBridge (or whatever remote program) to come on when the computer starts.  I Gbridge into the remote pc, I call my other Skype account that's logged in on the remote pc, use remote to answer it in video call mode and I can see what my webcam is pointing at. I can then get off of GBridge to save bandwidth.

It is VERY DIFFICULT to set up wirelessly for viewing on the internet ( and I am an engineer with lots of experience with tech gear). I could not do it without Panasonic's tech support line and even then it still took over 1/2 hour with them to get it to limp along. Using the hardwired feature is straight forward once you make sure you have the UPnp turned on which means you have to access your router via 192.169.1.1. then hunt around for the Upnp setting which takes a great deal of time.Oh and there is NO AUDIO when using it via your iPhone. And it is the audio that is most important in my view.We also discovered that this camera was previously purchased and returned and registered by someone else so I could not use their Viewnet feature. It takes 4/5 business days to reset. You can try to use your computers IP address with port 50000 but that does not always work either.The camera craps out for no reason at all every now a then and often will not restart properly.The thing is I bought a wired version of this same camera a few years ago. It worked for about a year and died. Even when it did work it often need to be restarted after a few weeks which renders the remote viewing feature useless much of the time.Bottomline, the wireless reliability, ease of use and setup rate a ZERO, in others words it is really BAD!
