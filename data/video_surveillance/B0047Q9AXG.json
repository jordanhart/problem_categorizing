They answered each question I had quickly and thoroughly!You NEED the XKLOADER2 to program this. If you buy it from some other places they might program it for you, but here you are getting a brand new one with a default firmware for some car. The web site will tell you what car it is.The Python 4203P starter does NOT receive a tach signal from this over the D2D connection. That isn't documented anywhere, and would have saved me a lot of time.The DBALL can \"FLASH\" the parking lights, but not keep them on in my car. So when the car starts, the parking lights are not on. No biggie, but it wasn't documented either.This unit does provide the brake, tach, parking light (flash) and key bypass for my 2007 Nissan Quest though. That saved me a lot of extra wiring in the car.(The instructions (again, on the web site) say it provides \"hood pin\" but there IS NO hood pin in my car (as confirmed by the shop manual), so that does have to be installed.)One thing the DBALL DOES do in my car, is briefly interrupt the \"auto headlight\" signal after the car shuts off. Otherwise they would stay on until the battery dies. This requires extra wiring, but without it, the installation would either prevent me from using the \"AUTO\" headlight feature, or risk running my battery down. I'm not sure if other bypass modules do this or not.There ARE other bypass module options out there, so do your research.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works like a champ!!", "Author": "Sawdust", "ReviewID": "R1CL5G8EYUL0I4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very easy plug n play installation.

The instructions were easy to follow, and the system worked the first time; no issues.  Make sure to get the XKLoader 2 along with this module as you must update the firmware before installing it.  The XKLoader is basically a ~$25 USB to CAN interface, but it's necessary in order to program the DBALL.  I had to connect ~12 wires between the Python 580 and the DBALL, and I have a fully functional remote start system.  The Python key fob is able to perform all the same functions as the factor fob, and then some.  The DBALL also does not require you to sacrifice a transponder key to work, which is nice.

A little difficult to figure out what you need and how to program. For my 2007 Dodge Caliber, I needed this DB-All, an XL202 RF module, a CHTHD2 T-Harness R9, and an XKLoader2 to flash the firmware.I was using the XL202 one-way, which means I only sent signals from my factory key fob to the car and not from the car back to the fob, so I didn't need an antenna. Your needs may vary.On the wiring harness, they have part numbers on their site in the installation manuals. Use the make/model selector and find your installation manual. THOUROUGHLY READ THE MANUAL BEFORE ORDERING ANYTHING! As I said, this is rather tricky, and some models do not have a plug-n-play wiring harness, which would considerably increase installation time. I'm an industrial electrician, and even I didn't want to mess with splicing some 12-odd wires under the dash on my back... I had to check my ignition switch wiring harness inside of my steering column ahead of time to verify that the CHTHD2 would work. Again, do you research, this is not an off-the-cuff project.Directions for flashing the correct firmware to your DB-All are also on their site, along with the free IE add-in to do so. If you have trouble flashing, try setting compatibility mode for IE if you're using a newer version (it's in the troubleshooting guide). I don't think the add-in (XPressVIP 4.5 at time of writing) is compatible with other browsers.Upon installation (follow the directions, and connect wires in proper order), mine did not work. After a little more reading, I had to reset the module and then program again with my factory key. Also, the safety disable toggle switch was in the 'off' position. After this, worked flawlessly. I have yet to hook up parking lights (which have to be run through a relay, I'm assuming because the output of the db-all can't supply enough current for the bulbs without frying). You can buy one cheap at an auto parts store.I spent $100. This is gf's Christmas present, though I gave it to her early; just couldn't wait and it's cold! :) Saved $200 by doing it myself. Spent 6 hours total, but 2/3 of that was reading and research. Actual install only took 20 minutes. Hope this review helps someone else save some time!Edit: I suppose I should mention I'm using this as a remote starter in what Xpress calls RSR (remote start ready) configuration.
