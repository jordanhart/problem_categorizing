I bought these to complete my CCTV System, and wanted to save money. A mistake. These cameras will simply NOT WORK AT NIGHT, on daylight are not good but ok. But at night they produce a horrible blurry image. Besides, they're small and not very strong, and their setting system is too basic. If you want a good camera but not paying much, try these: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003EUHPMO/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1. But I will never recommend these \"2 x high resolution 650 TV lines Sony CCD Waterproof Day night bullet cameras\".In this new post I'd like to say that I contacted the seller to complain, and after explaining the problem, they asked me to paint the cover with black (!). It helped a lot. Seems that the white reflects the IR LED lights and that produces the blurry effect. I'd keep them 'cause I am abroad...but even though the problem was almost fixed and the seller was kind, I will definitely NOT RECOMMEND to buy these. The image is average, not good, and you're not supposed to make this kind of repairs to a brand-new product, right?", "Date": "March 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "1/3\" Sony Color CCD Image Sensor; 650 Horizontal TV Lines\n3.6mm lens, Wide View Angel\nNight Vision Min.
