If you have any trouble with these cams this is why and how to fix it.Ours have logged a month of use and are at 99% battery with tons of good pics taken day and night.Cheers", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works great, amazing at the price", "Author": "Olzab", "ReviewID": "RNBFPL3A5B39L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Original review about 8/7/13 - Got this cam after many bear signs outside my semi-rural New Mexico home. It works great, and my improving skills setting it up will help it be better yet! Anyway, let these videos speak for themselves; I only got the camera 3 days ago!  Edit, 9/5/13 - I've gotten many night videos of bears with my Truthcam35 now; it is reliable at seeing them, and you would never know they were there otherwise. You can see the results at [...]  ...It is not a perfect camera; in fact I'm here looking to see if a faster card will help it write files faster and miss less action (each 1 minute video takes about 30 seconds more to finish writing to my 16gb Class 4 card) , but other than that, it films us every time we pass by it at my house, and my many new BACKYARD BEAR night videos (thanks to the Truthcam) speak for themselves. I have to change the (rechargeable AA) batteries about every five nights, and my 16gb card is only 30% full with 46 one minute videos on the camera. Oh, and it sits out in the pouring rain and does its job perfectly without damage, too. And it's cool to see what you look like when you forget you're being filmed. And it works exactly as they instruct, with the ability to choose between motion/IR capture photos, up to several at a time, or videos of several lengths (with sound! - on one of the bear videos she pants right into it!), or even several time-lapse photo options, just by setting a few switches. I never imagined I would be given the capabilities of this device for about $100. It has actually enhanced our lives, and I find the negative review shameful. This device is most certainly not junk, and I work for nobody.", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good little camera", "Author": "Padcock", "ReviewID": "R2335XFKZQ91FK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had a Primos DPS that worked fine and had good battery life but the pictures were blurry around the edge. I sent it back to Bushnell who owns Primos now.  They sent me back the new ultra 35 because the DPS is discontinued. I was mad because I wanted a plot watcher type camera. It takes good day pictures. The flash is real bright. Trigger speed is good. No blank pictures. The pictures are not real clear at night but not blurry like several other ir cams.  I tested it on time lapse plus pic for seven days. I figured batteries would be low. I had taken over 100 pic and about 10 videos prior to time lapse. Battery meter said 99% I figured it just took 34 pic.  When I got home it was all night pic.  But I also had 7 days of time lapse video. I had deer all in the plot that I would have never got a picture of on just camera mode. I have a new lil plot watcher.", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "RTJYHRFU9SHNO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this camera.  It takes good photos day or night that usually seem to have an animal, not just a weed blowing.  I've had it out for over a month with probably 500+ photos and I'm still on my first set of batteries, it says 85% remaining.  I like the information that it places on the bottom of the photos.  All of the controls are pretty easy to understand.  No major complaints but sometimes I have a little trouble getting it to turn off.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "nb", "ReviewID": "R22GELA38V9XRZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the price I think this is a great camera. I really like how a cable lock wraps around the front through the slot, which makes it much more secure, if you are locking it. The early detection sensor activates the camera and starts shooting before the game gets into frame instead of when its already past. night shots are a little blurry when the game is moving, just like the other cameras I've seen. the night range is pretty good, for me around 35 feet or more. My Bushnell HD Black Flash has maybe a little better night range and has no lights at all that give away its location. This camera does have red led lights for the night shots, so if you need to keep it covert for the 2 legged camera grabbers this may be detected at night. There are not any black flash cameras in this price range unfortunately. I am happy with this camera, Its also a lot smaller than the Primos Truth Cam 35, so the lock box which is sold separately is different. Amazon may suggest the wrong lock box, as with me, which I returned.", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the money.", "Author": "james simons", "ReviewID": "R2P51JJGF3Z593", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great camera for the price.

I have gotten hundreds of pictures and taken about fifty to sixty videos. I still have 80% battery life left and it has taken great pictures. I have not had a single wash out picture and my camera even faces toward the rising sun. I have read all the reviews on here and on other sites. I guess there is always the possibility of getting a lemon, but my camera has worked fantastically. Mine is the 2013 model and I will definitely be buying a few more for next year. I hope everyone has the same success with their camera as I have.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Critters I didn't know we had!", "Author": "Dempsy Winans", "ReviewID": "RFU3SBJCX6LBM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I set this camera up to track deer at a corn feeder but found out that Coyotes, Wild Pigs, Coons, Rabbits and all kinds of different critters came around to either nibble on the corn, or to hunt the small prey that did.  Interesting to see exactly what's out there.  It would do the same in your back yard or wherever.  A friend of mine was having problems with employees stealing gas from his shop and set one of these same cameras on a shelf and caught the thief the very next day!

Best thing is that the batteries last a really long time! I used energizer batteries and a set of 8 will last for roughly 3K plus pictures and 90% of those are night pics which use more battery. I just retrieved it after a week of video mode and it took 26 videos using only 15% of the battery life!! I would like to see the video start a little more quickly (about a second sooner would be great) but for the money I have no room to complain.On picture mode it is very sensitive at 50'. Most other cameras are not sensitive at their max range but this one responds very well.I have had many game cameras and this is by far the best camera I have ever owned in this price range.

The only negative I have is that Primos needs to put more emphasis on the fact that there are 2 quite different ULTRA 35 trail cameras. I liked my first one so well I bought another , it was 3 MP instead of 4 MP and did not have the 45 degree PIR sensor. Both are the same physical size and look exactly alike.
