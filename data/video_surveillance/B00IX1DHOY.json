In addition to being a media center for your office or room it is a spy camera that records video, photos and audio in color and in the dark with night vision technology.  The unit weighs only 5 3/8 ounces and is 3 inches wide by 2 inches tall by 1 and 15/16 inches deep.While it sits on your desk it can unobtrusively record what is going on around you.  Are you being harassed by a fellow employee or a boss?  Is someone taking things out of your desk?  Do you want to keep an eye on your babysitter, your children or your pets while you are away from home.  This great little camera can solve your problem by recording what goes on in color video and storing it inside of itself on a Micro SD card that you have to purchase separately.The unit even has a hidden menu to set up the spy portion of the functions and it even has a hidden file system that hides the recorded videos, photos or audio so that someone cannot find them unless they know the secret access to the system.Here is what comes in the package:* The beautiful clock radio itself* A rechargeable and replaceable Lithium battery that is a Nokia BL-5C 1000 mAh battery with 3.7 volts DC output.* A 24 inch long charging cable* An AC wall charger rated to operate on 110 to 240 VAC 50/60 HZ that outputs 5 VDC at 1 Amp.* A 39 inch long set of earphones* A 25 inch long auxiliary cable to allow you to listen to your stereo music from your MP3 player or phone.* An instruction manual that is VERY difficult to read as the text is microscopic* A software disc that has the drivers to let you use the unit as a web camera* A carrying bag to transport the unit so you can take it with youIn addition the clock radio has built in:* A spy camera the makes color videos or photos with night vision.* A microphone to record audio* A calendar function* A digital clock* A headphone jack* An auxiliary jack* A Micro SD card slot that can handle up to a 32 GIG memory (The memory is not furnished)*  A Mini USB charging port so the unit is portable and you can move it into an office or room with you and use it and not have to immediately plug it in.  The unit can also remain continuously plugged in to operate on the AC power adapter.* A high resolution 2 inch diagonal color display to view your videos and the set up menus on* Two speakers for great sounding stereo music* A fully functioning FM radio that must have either the Aux cable or the earphones plugged in to act as the FM antenna.  If one or the other is not plugged in then the radio will not pick up  a radio station.You can add videos, music and photos to the SD card and even play them on the screen if you want.  You can program the unit to secretly record video continuously and walk away as the unit simply displays time.  It is so small and simple that no one will even notice it or know what it is doing.  A small blue light on the front tells you that it is secretly recording what is going on.  You can program the unit to record continuously and leave it plugged into the AC power source.  The unit can be set up to delete the oldest files and add the new ones when the memory SD card gets full. In my video I go over the basic controls and set up and show a brief piece of video.  The unit works perfectly.  This is an excellent product and I highly recommend it if you have the need for a spy camera.  I rated it at 5 stars.I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation. A review was not promised to the supplier in exchange for the sample.", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Small size - Incredible utility.", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R2KKYK4XDZ71BX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a tiny device. This looks exactly as in photo, but not the size of a traditional bedside camera.  Much smaller! With a rechargeable battery as well as power adapter, this is ideal for small sized monitoring or a few hours. I put in a microSD card of 32 GB and it came for more than 10 hours, still had space left. Infrared for In-the-Dark Recording is very cool. So you can keep in clear visible area and no one will doubt this has a camera!I tried FM and MP3 files and they worked as expected. Overall a very nice concept and good for specific use cases. I am very impressed with the size and utility of the device!  I was provided this product in exchange of a fair and honest review.", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Neat little machine.", "Author": "You mean she's NOT Irish?", "ReviewID": "R1IZLD9TACE490", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This spy camera is pretty cool, it does what it's supposed to. It's very inconspicuous, which is obviously why its a spy camera. The fact that it has other functions other than a camera makes it worth buying because if someone who may be suspicious of it asks about it, you can just show them the other features; radio, picture viewer, music player, video player(they wont be able to see the secret videos).My only complaint is that the speakers on this thing are unreliable, I actually had to send two of these back and even though the third one didn't work perfectly either I just kept it because I needed the camera function ASAP. On my first camera, the right speaker was crystal clear, the left speaker however had bad static feedback; so I sent it back thinking it was just a dud. The second camera I received, BOTH the speakers gave reeeeaaalllly poor quality sound; so I sent that one back hoping \"the third times a charm\" or however it goes.... Nope, third one, speakers are both giving poor sound quality, but not as bad as the second one. Guess I'm gonna have to deal with it, don't want the kind people of Amazon hating me.If your buying this camera so you can capture video AND sound, beware; the speakers could be faulty just like 5 out of 6 were on my purchases. Wont be much use if your trying to prove someone is verbally abusing you or whatnot. I would give this product a 3.5 stars out of five, but I can only do 3 or 4... Sorry, but for ~$80 I don't think it's too much to ask for both speakers to work well. Definitely worth a shot though, it is a very handy little machine!This review is for 1st purchased camera.", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "So much more than it appears to be", "Author": "J. Chambers", "ReviewID": "R3UES1RU568Q0T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a remarkable little device. On the surface, it appears to be a very small clock radio (FM only) and MP3 player. It's actually much more, though. A built-in (and virtually unnoticeable) camera with a wide-angle lens can continuously record everything in front of the device even in dim lighting. All this comes in a little box barely 3 inches wide and weighing only 5\u00bd ounces.The kit includes the clock radio/spy camera, a 3.5mm audio cable, AC power adapter, USB charging cable with mini-USB plug, a set of earphones, and a carrying pouch. You'll need to provide an SDHC memory card. The radio uses a replaceable 1000mAh rechargeable Li-ion battery that can be recharged while it's in the radio with the included USB charging cable.My only serious negative comment is about the user manual. Setting up the device and using the different functions isn't too intuitive, and the instructions aren't as clear as they could be. Also, the print is too small to read without a magnifying glass. I ended up scanning the user manual and enlarging it. As aggravating as that was, though, it's worth the effort to get the spy camera radio clock working.A product sample was provided for review purposes.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "nice spy cam", "Author": "Annie Oakley", "ReviewID": "R1BAY6HW77NDO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like the thought of having a spy cam, but you almost have to be a techy to figure out how to set the camera up  to record and then to playback. The little (and I do mean little) instruction booklet is hard to read because of the tiny, tiny writing and it doesn't cover everything. Most helpful was a video review about this camera and I watched it over and over again while I was trying to set the camera up. I still discovered some issues, but when I turned it off and back on again, the camera reset and I was able to proceed to the set-up. I am writing my own instructions so I will always be able to set it up and record. The pictures were great once I got the camera set up right, remember to have the night vision on otherwise, the video will be very dark.All in all, once I have it figured out, i think it will be a great little camera.

No one seems to notice that it is actually a camera. I love the fact that it comes with a fully functional speaker, the night vision is pretty awesome and that it has a long period of record time. It was everything I was looking for in a spy cam. I shopped around on several sites for different types of spy cams, and this one sold me with the features and the price.
