Thomas", "ReviewID": "R1XKQNCW8MWHIM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Modern IP/network security cameras are white, and in the case of bullet cameras, slim. Most of the fake cameras are silver, which at this point is 1980's retro and not a viable ruse for home use. This fake camera is white, slim, a modern ergo design and has realistic looking LED bulbs surrounding the lens... all tell tail signs of a real IP camera being sold today. Spend the few extra dollars and get a fake camera that actually looks like a modern IP camera, because IT geeks and well researched criminals can tell the difference!", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Realistic", "Author": "JOE SMOTZ", "ReviewID": "R2V8OBDZMBY73U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to install and works great!!
