I bought all these 11002 as a 4 pack.Took 2 of these cameras too a friends house and hooked up on north side and south side of home. Installed them on his security system.The color is off at his house also.I would bet Svat knows about problem but they are made in China at a factory that massed produced them and they have a warehouse full.They figure instead of scrapping them just sell.No profit money lost. I will try to get replacement camera up and report back on its color.", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice and reliable", "Author": "J. F.
