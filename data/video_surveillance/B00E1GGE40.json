McWhorter", "ReviewID": "R1O4178XHCTGJG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "There are pluses and minuses with this camera, and I will give my honest reaction after playing with it for some time.First, lets talk about the pluses. The camera is very easy to install and snap your first few pictures. Simply plug the ribbon cable into the Raspberry Pi board, and configure the camera using the standard Pi setup program. Then there are some very simple command line commands that you can give to snap stills or videos. So, in about 5 minutes you can have this up and running and taking your first pictures.I was impressed with the quality of the pictures. Definitely not what you would get from a sony handycam, but about on par with higher end camera phones.The reason for my three star rating is that it is very hard to incorporate this camera into  projects that go beyond simply clicking pictures from the command line. If you come from the arduino world where components come with libraries, tons of \"instructables\", online tutorials, and a vibrant user community always willing to help, you are going to feel very much alone trying to work with this camera. I did find a number of tutorials online where people had gotten it to work, but in most cases I could not replicate their success. For example, trying to build a camera that would remotely show realtime video on a windows machine, I could never get any of the examples to work in a stable fashion. The best I could do was a system that will work a few minutes and then lock up.In fairness, I am not a linux expert. If you are a linux expert, and can make linux systems sing and dance, then you will probably love this camera, and not have the troubles I have had. If you are an Arduino guy, like me, and trying to move up to learning a more powerful system, you likely will experience my frustrations.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice camera", "Author": "BobbyD", "ReviewID": "RNQATA5F1LIV2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a really easy to use camera for the Pi.

Since there are only two available options for Pi cameras, I won't go into the fact that it works well because it was designed to work specifically with the Pi.  My gripe would be the box that the module comes in folds the ribbon cable in half which I originally feared had killed my module. I later discovered an error in the code I was using to operate the camera and the culprit, but a is seems that a better solution for packing the module needs to be identified.

There are longer flat cables available for it, I think from Adafruit, but possibly from others as well.
