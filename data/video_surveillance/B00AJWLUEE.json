I went with the FI9821W, which has resulted in some minor problems for me personally, but given the feedback on cam-it.org, a widely used support forum for interested ip cam enthusiasts, others who have bought the FI9821W are doing far worse.I'll say that the camera does significantly improve bandwidth usage using the H.264 compression.  However I have the feeling that the compression is set too high in the software with no way to adjust it.  Although the image size is HD (1280X720) the image quality is definitely NOT HD.  It's more standard resolution quality than HD.  With no way to solve the compression problem, I think I'm stuck with a standard resolution camera at an HD price.As for the firmware, I've had my camera up for a little over two weeks and noticed that the preset positions get corrputed and the camera ends up pointing off to some other random position, which makes the PTZ functions useless if you're using the camera to monitor an area unattended.If you've previously purchased a Foscam camera you'll know that the web interface is somewhat less than attractive.  The new interface is MUCH better and works fine over Firefox with the installed addin or IE.Given some of the problems I've experienced and some of the stories I've read from other users, I'd put your purchase on hold until the camera issues are resolved.

In nearly all respects I find the FI9821W to be a better camera. The audio works properly. The pan/zoom speed is adjustable. The web interface is much improved. The night vision is also much improved.I do, however, observe to issues with the new model:1) The wider angle lens in the FI9821W results in much more spherical aberration than in the FI9820W. Straight vertical objects on the sides of the view are very noticeably curved. Frankly, I liked the smaller field-of-view lens on the FI9820W much better.2) Even though the web interface allows you to change the frame rate and key frame interval, no matter what values you enter the frame rate remains at 25 fps. My guess is that this is a firmware bug, but there is no new firmware available on FOSCAMs web site at the current time.My camera has System Firmware Version 1.2.1.1 and App Firmware Version 1.1.1.7.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Utter Garbage", "Author": "Not My Real Name", "ReviewID": "R1LD784EWKQZ07", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I own multiple network cameras, including older foscam and Agasio (rebadged foscam). I was looking forward to this new \"HD\" camera being a step up from the rather basic, but effective previous products foscam has created.It is not. It is much much worse than any camera I have ever seen - for the last 10 years. The image quality is absolutely terrible. It might have a higher resolution sensor and be using h.264 to compress the image, but it doesnt matter, because whatever they are doing, they are doing it really really badly. My older foscam (vga) is much higher image quality.In addition, foscam have re-implemented their web UI, so that rather than having one simple web ui, you now have 2 separate ports that need to be redirected and are inter-dependent. There is also an activeX control or a chrome extension you can install (the default install does not work, you have to find it on the chrome store). Overall, the entire UI is much worse than the older versions.Additionally, the setup now requires a windows app (no mac) that scans the network for cameras and allows you to set them up. Except this utility is highly unstable and unnecessary because mdns has done this for years, and much more successfully.This is a terrible product.

The setup instructions were clear but rely on certain level of tech savvy that isn't universal.  For what it's worth, if you expect to view the camera from anywhere in the world you need to setup port forwarding and IP reservation on your router for both the media and the \"normal\" port.  Once you have the port forwarding setup correctly, you need to login to the camera and ensure the ports you forwarded match up (default ports for a single camera are 88 and 888).The software they provide \"IPCamera\" is convenient enough to help you connect to the camera initially and really other than the work the router I found their administrative UI + instructions with pictures to be \"good enough\".  I really had no difficulty getting stuff working through their stated supported scenarios.Now to the sticking points.  Since I'm using this camera as a baby monitor, I wanted to setup multiple devices to view and listen in on the camera.  Finding apps that met my desires for each of my devices was more work that I initially anticipated, I will come back to this.Another downside, I get a certain base level of \"crackle\" over the audio feed that doesn't bother me but might be a problem for you.Now, onto apps:  First off I should describe my particular problem.  I am a Microsoft products user, as such, standard things like monitoring through Windows OS/IE worked right out of the box and were easy while others like getting monitoring through my Windows Phone 8 were a trial.  For straight \"Windows\" and IE this setup was brain dead simple (especially once I had the ddns link working).  I just hit the ddns site on each regular windows PC, logged in to test everything worked and the audio/video quality was good.  I was able to get good video and audio quality from my wireless-cable-(Seattle)->internet->Alaska.On Windows 8 RT (Surface) I tried a few different apps but I decided to stick with and install/pay for CameraKaze.  I haven't tested a connection through the internet, in this case I'm using Wireless->Router->Wireless connection as my Surface(s) are going to my primary baby monitoring devices when at home.  The Audio seems one-way through this app (but it's the right direction, camera to viewer) and the video doesn't properly resize when snapped, but for 5.00/install I'm not going to complain too much since the app included features like in-network detection and audio and it works on ARM.  I also have a Surface Pro (but pro uses \"traditional\" windows, so the IE plugin is great and what I want).On my Windows 8 Phone I tried several apps and could not get them to work. I finally settled on NetCam Pro.  I paid 30.00 for this guy, the audio doesn't work and honestly the interface sucks...but it does work without me needing to connect directly to the network so it fulfills the minimal requirement (and honestly the other app options I was able to demo wouldn't work).  My hope here is to use this app to do \"baby-sitter spying\" so it was a requirement that I could use DDNS to connect instead of using the raw IP (ie, checking on the sitter when we go out...when we eventually cross that bridge of hiring a sitter). It's good enough, but if you're looking for good Camera support on Windows Phone 8, the apps that are available right now don't seem to be of great quality.  I suspect the supported fruit and robot apps work better given there's a broader audience in those eco-systems.I give this product a 4*, they have actually have reasonable support forums, the hardware quality seems there (and with the flash update at least) the software pretty much works as advertised.  It's not a 5* because honestly I think their instructions on port-forwarding are not enough for \"the mere mortal\" and that audio-crackle is something they probably could have solved by having either better filtering on the mic gain or a controllable \"minimal threshold\" that could be set in the camera administration.", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worked for 2 months then DIED", "Author": "Randy Frey", "ReviewID": "R1E82S7TKYOUK0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Is this camera worth $160?

I have multiple other foscam cameras and was excited to \"upgrade\" to a higher resolution. My first FI9821W loaded up once, spun around and I thought all was good. I was unable to find it on the IP Camera Tool so I unplugged it to try it again - it didn't move... it is supposed to swivel around and do it's dance after being plugged in. Called Foscam, unit was determined to be defective. I returned the unit to Amazon. Received my 2nd one through another seller on Amazon. Seemed to work well, besides the firmware allowing anyone access to the camera, even without a password... (see last straw below) we went on vacation and on the 4th day or so that camera was blank. I returned home to find the cable and camera both quite hot. So I unplugged it and let it cool down. I plugged it in again and it worked for another 30min or so. It has had spotty performance throughout the day as I have troubleshot it - so I am returning this one as well.Last Straw:I installed the latest firmware that was supposed to fix the security vulnerabilities. After install, it can no longer connect to WiFi connections... Seriously?Bottom Line:Foscam has put this camera out without thorough testing. How could you release a camera that can be logged into without a password? Then - how do you release a patch to that bug that breaks the WiFi capabilities?! On a positive note, the non-hd version of this camera is working well.

I'm not doing anything fancy - no recording, motion detection, or email alerts - just plain live video viewable from anywhere.Pros: Seems well built, despite the plastic housing. The pan/tilt motor runs quietly. Good quality picture. Easily set up to view from my Android phone and the internet (with networking know-how; probably not so easy for your basic user). Foscam support was friendly and helpful, but could have been better - more on that later. The web interface is easy to navigate (BUT...).Cons: The web interface is quite buggy. This is something that could be fixed in a future update, but it is a serious issue that needs to be addressed SOON. When I called support because clicking any camera control buttons on the webpage did absolutely nothing when logged in as admin (the \"operator\" account worked, but I needed to flip the view for ceiling mount), they attempted to flash a new firmware version to my camera. It didn't take. It would start applying the update, then kick us back to the login page. After several attempts, they had me factory reset the camera. We logged in and, viola! The controls worked! I thanked them and let them go. Fast forward 10 minutes, and I realize I need to mirror the image. It no longer responds. I wasted HOURS factory resetting, reconfiguring, encountering issue after issue. I still can't get the newer firmware 1.1.1.13 (current is 1.1.1.11) to install, but I also can't find it on their support page, so maybe it is pre-release or something. If you try to log into the camera's web interface  as a non-admin and you don't have the plugin installed, you will get a \"Permission denied\" error (I get why, but they should make the error more understandable, or allow login and redirect to an installation page). Also, if you are trying to read their documentation, \"Engrish\" abounds - have fun with that.TIP - THIS IS WHAT CAUSED MY INTERFACE PROBLEMS: Do NOT use special characters in your password!! It will let you do it, but it breaks all the controls on the \"Live Video\" tab and makes it so you can't change the video settings. If you already have special characters in your password, you can change it and restore the functionality. I hope I can save some headaches! :) I find it odd that Foscam support apparently did not know this, so I will be bringing this to their attention.Other: They provided a mount, of sorts. It worked well enough to wedge the camera into a drop tile ceiling, but it's a plastic bracket with a few predefined positions. It's a nice touch, but expect to find some other means to mount your camera.In short, if the buggy interface issues are addressed I will happily raise my rating.", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not ready for prime time", "Author": "Mary C.

I wanted a wifi device that I could display on my computer monitor, iphone, ipad, and access from the internet. This cam fits the bill perfectly at a very reasonable cost. Much of my experience with this is in relation to my two other cameras: IP cam Logitech Alert 750e Outdoor Master Security Camera System with Night Vision (961-000337) and baby monitor Infant Optics Add-On Camera for DXR-5 2.4 Ghz Video Monitor (DXR-871)What I like:* More than one person/device can access it simultaneously. My wife and I both like to keep an eye on our little one. Also, sometimes I'm watching him on my computer screen, but then I want to run downstairs so I can continue monitoring on my phone.* With additional software, it integrates well with other existing IP cameras.* Participates in my wifi network, instead of destroying it.* Pan and tilt are great features that I never had before.* Night vision is bright with great visibility.* Very nicely priced when compared to other wifi/internet cams.* Wide screen field of view is very appreciated after watching my Logitech Alert cam for the past couple of years.* It's portable enough to move it from room to room, but also versatile enough to permanently mount in the corner of a room.What I don't like:* Much more difficult to configure than a typical baby monitor or consumer oriented IP cam. They aren't too bad for someone with any kind of home networking experience, but if you don't it may be a little intimidating.* Apps for mobile devices require an additional purchase.* Included software is not good at all in my opinion. I'd highly recommend purchasing Blue Iris to manage it, especially if you have other IP cams.I made sure to update the firmware to the latest (v1.1.1.13 at the time) the day I received the cam.

I preferred the FI9810W view.* SMTP mail doesn't work for me. Mail functions do not correctly identify the camera after passing EHLO causing problems with some SMTP servers - FW 1.1.1.13* Device advertised WPS support but WPS is not mentioned in any of the documentation.* For wireless encryption passwords, \"System prohibits the & and = symbols\". This wasn't a problem on the FI8910W.* Ethernet cable provided was flat and recoiled into a spool making it only good for setup.

The three lights on the back that show power and Ethernet are quite bright. They actually light up the room at night when the lights are off. Also, the \"Infrared\" LEDs on the front are BRIGHT red and really light the place up. I have another infrared camera and you cannot see the LEDs at all whether they are on or off.

But I couldn't get the HD to alarm and trigger even when the older one worked fine.Pros:1. The image is bigger and clearer.2. The web interface is all new and has a few improvements.Cons:1. The alarm requires a minimum of 5 seconds of motion before it triggers; that's too long.  5 seconds gives an intruder plenty of time to run across the camera's field of view and not trigger.  The older FI8910W only needs 1 second.2. The alarm sensitivity only has 3 setting; low, medium, and high which is not granular enough. The FI8910W sensitivity was on a scale of 1 - 10 which allowed for more accurate settings.3. The web app login requires a media port which is pre-populated.  Sometimes, the field is blank and you can't login and you have to reboot the camera. This is not convenient if the camera is mounted in an inconvenient location.The 9821 needs for field testing and Foscam needs to work out the bugs a little more.

Unfortunately, this camera promises a lot more than it can readily deliver.After upgrading to the latest firmware and UI:1) Camera controls are SERIOUSLY laggy and fickle. Even connected to the LAN, camera responses can take upwards of a second before the motors engage, and the distance the motor travels can be arbitrary at best.2) low light images produce a LOT of noise. I know that this isn't a top of the line CCD and that the CPU is probably maxed, but under non-daylight levels, blacks tend to vary enough that my Linux Motion monitor triggers false positives from the distortions.3) MJPEG streaming output is limited to VGA quality (640x480). It does lossy conversion from 1280x720 to 640x480, so you get slightly more resolution thanks to pixel aliasing, but it's hardly what you'd expect.4) It is very difficult to find any information about the latest API. This means that the H.264 is useless for anything other than writing directly to the local SD card. And, no, there doesn't appear to be a way to access the SD card remotely, either. Granted, when you do find the docs, you'll see you need to send your user and password in clear text in the URL. Yeah, that's secure. \u0ca0_\u0ca05) You can only view the media stream via a plugin. If you can't run the plugin, you can't see the camera output. You can dig around and try to find the MJPG stream (provided you can find any API documentation to point you how to do that.), but otherwise, you're dorked.5) The camera crashes, a lot. Right now, it's locked hard and unresponsive. That means when it breaks someone will have to go and manually reset it. Not really a good idea if you're trying to monitor something remotely, huh?This is not a tool you can rely on. This is an expensive, persnickety toy. I'd do better with a raspberry PI and some LEGO than this.

Nowak", "ReviewID": "R82PJMMEVE0LV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "These things are frustrating beasts.  On the one hand, they aren't horrendously expensive, and it seems almost impossible to find a universally loved camera that doesn't cost a lot of money.  And when they work, they work well.  But, the reliability is very suspect, and the technical support very iffy.  This is my 3rd camera from them.  The first one was an MJPEG model (the 8910), and that ran into the problem of a bright/complex picture would crash the camera.  (Reading through the FOSCAM forums, that problem seems to have been solved by some enterprising contributors after about 6 months of work.  Although FOSCAM technical help is spotty, there are some very good people on their forums, so go dig through there for useful info on any of the camera models).  Luckily that happened quickly enough for me to return the camera for a refund.The second one was a FI9821 V1, which worked great for 3.5 months in a semi-outdoor setting (inside a duck coop, hanging upside down from the ceiling).  The other day when moving it, unplugging it and plugging it back in, it went into an endless cycle of rebooting.  This seems to be a known issue (hopefully fixed in the latest firmware, which sadly I hadn't installed).  The unit is basically bricked.  That seems to be the consensus of the forum, and from Foscam technical support.  And sadly, it wasn't purchased from one of their providers, so it doesn't fall under warranty and the money is a write off.So, I have replaced it with this one, which although not being listed as V2 actually did come that way.  (I assume that they have run through the V1 stock at this point).  This time I have immediately updated the firmware, and purchased from Amazon which allegedly should get me the full year warranty, which I suspect I might need.  Again, it's working great now, but I don't have a strong feeling that it will be that way for the long haul.But, the thing is, even having eaten the cost of the first one, I don't see anything else out there that, reading the reviews, makes me think would work any better or more reliably for anywhere near this price.

While googling for a solution, I came across quite a few customers who have experienced the exact same problem. While these cameras no longer (I hope) have the ridiculously gaping security holes ( [...] ), it seems clear to me that the firmware was rushed to market with some very serious bugs that have ended up bricking a lot of these IP cameras.I contacted Foscam via their website, and may revise this review upwards if they are willing to replace it with a functional one with minimal cost and hassle.If you're willing to be a beta tester for Foscam and put up with some annoyances in return for the cheap price, this might be a good choice for you.

They replaced all 3 cameras (version 1.0) with 3 new cameras (version 2.0 -- which fixed the overheating issue that damaged the v.1 cameras).  They have shipped the cameras and once I get them I'll reinstall them and see how long they last.  Foscam assured me that the overheating issue has been resolve.

The first one suddenly stopped working and looks like it keeps restarting itself (the same routine it goes thru when you first plug it in, but it's nonstop).  Within the next 2 months they all were doing this same thing.  It was nice while it worked, but having 3 with the exact same problems is telling in my humble opinion.

I rate this a one-star under protest.If you are looking for a camera that:- sometimes works in displaying an image- has certain functions that never work- has an issues list 84 pages long on the Foscam support forum- is rendered completely useless (bricked) after a firmware updatethen this is the camera for you.I've had this camera about 4 months.  The first month or two was awful.  The camera would not stay connected to a very strong wifi signal and did not have the smarts to reconnect on it's own.  Foscam released a firmware upgrade that helped it reconnect so that issue was solved for the most part.  I still needed to reboot the thing manually every week or so.  This is not a camera that is to be relied upon, so if that is your goal....do not buy this camera.  I bought it as a baby monitor so it only needed to stay connected through the night....which it rarely did.Foscam released another firmware update (1.1.1.13) in June.  I thought that maybe this would help with some of my issues.  I upgraded the firmware following their instructions exactly.  The camera interface stated that the upgrade was successful and that the camera was rebooting.  After that, bye bye camera.  It appears to be up and running and grabs an IP address from my router.  However, it cannot be connected to via any means (their MyIP Camera tool, the web interface, CGI commands).  No amount of factory resets helped.So now I have to pay to ship this piece of garbage back to Foscam so they can fix it.

Ferris", "ReviewID": "R11VXPE6JTVGRU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have an older PT Foscam that is not true color. After replacing some of my stationary cams with true color I became addictied to the idea that all my cams need to be that way.  I purchased this one and have had it about 2 weeks now.  Dispite having so much trouble with the Foscam's 18903's I am still riding on the idea that all my older cam's are Foscam and they worked great.I love my 18918w Pt cam but once again it isn't true color.Back to the new 19821.  It is a great cam.  The picture and the audio are fantastic.  I wish Foscam would work on a zoom but other than that it's just what you're looking for.  Now....this morning when I looked on my phone for this cam it was gone.  So I looked on my home network and it was not visable there either.  I powered it down and back up and it reappeared.  This is the same problem that I had with the 18903's that I finally replaced with Agasio 603's but with those cam's the reboot started from the very beginning.I don't want to have to worry about having someone reboot my camera's while I'm off on a trip somewhere.  The whole reason I have them is so I can monitor my home while away.  If they keep blinking out then they are of no use to me.  This 19821 has only done it once but now I'm suspious that it will do it again.  I guess time will tell.  I have a couple more weekd before I get to the poin that I can't return it.

It is basic due diligence when producing a device for the end consumer to ensure that firmware updates work. The user can go to a device admin page, check for updates, download updates and install those updates.This device fails at all three.1) Once on the admin page it will tell you what firmware version it is. But it won't be able to check for updates. It does not even give a link. Not even to a generic manufacturer support page. You have to google the device and then scan down the search results to find the manufacturer's page.  Then you have to browse around to find the download link.  Here is the kicker, when you click the download link they demand that you sign up your email for marketing updates before they give you the firmware.At this point there is no use going forward.  Any company stupid enough to require their users to sign up for marketing updates to simply patch their hardware is not worth doing business with.  I look at the bright side, I just saved you $110.Note: I got a ASUS (RT-AC68U) Wireless-AC1900 Dual-Band Gigabit Router and it does a fine job checking for, downloading, and updating updates all by itself.

Geddes", "ReviewID": "R2ABYKM9FWYQZ0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just got the camera set up after stumbling a bit in the initial set up process (camera should be at least 5 ft away from router). I called tech support (Harry Foster) who made it a breeze to get my camera working. They did everything by remote viewer so I was able to watch as Harry was in control of my computer installing the latest firmware and checking my ip address and router set up. If you are not a techie yourself, then no worries as you can just call them and they will direct you to a website, click a button, give them the code and they will do the set up remotely. The camera is great (love that you can remote control it). Home security is important and I already have external cameras - I bought this model for the inside. I like the fact that there is a sd card slot so it will record onboard as well. Great product (***wait, read updates below***) and as mentioned great tech support (only had to wait about 2 mins to get a rep).  Highly recommend.Update 10/25/2013I am sadly changing this from 5 stars to 1. I was impressed originally with how the tech support got the camera up and running remotely, however, out of 2 cameras ordered, I am now on my 3rd replacement and the wifi just cut out so I may be looking at a 4th replacement. I have tried calling tech support for the last 1 1/2 hours and I'm just getting a busy signal. The 1st replacement was due to the SD Card reader not working. The next two replacements were because the camera would not connect and when I tried turning off and on and resetting they would just continuously spin around. I hope this wifi issue I currently have will be an easy fix if I can get in touch with tech support. I would not purchase this camera again as they obviously have quality control issues. My second last replacement was Version 2 and it seems to be ok at the moment. I wish you all the best luck if you get Version 1. I am also a little angry at myself because the 3rd time I sent back the camera I forgot to remove the SD Card (32gb) and when I asked if they could send it back, I was told \"sorry, the box has already been opened\", so it cost me another $20 for a new card, that was my bad.Update 11/09/2013I did get through to tech support on 10/25 and they were as always very helpful and got the camera running again. No issues so far and both cameras are performing as they should.Update 2/22/2014Well, the wifi option of the camera konked out again and I called tech support. The first person struggled for a while and when I later mentioned this was the 3rd replacement the line disconnected or dropped, whatever. I called back again and got a different tech support guy who again went through various things. After a good 10 minutes he seemed stumped and again I mentioned this current camera is my 3rd replacement - the line dropped. I am giving up on the wifi which is the whole reason why I bought this camera. I am going to have to relocate the camera in a spot I really did not want to locate it to only because I will now have to rely on a hardwire (ethernet cable). This camera model was a nice idea but it always fails. I was tempted to call back and ask for another replacement (there is a newer version) but am tired of paying $15 postage each time and with this track record, could not trust it to be reliable. 0 out of 5 stars!Update 3/10/2014Hardwired my Foscam, external viewing still not working. At least the alarm setting with email is working or rather was - it worked for all of 1 day before the whole camaera went kaput! Now I get\" Oops! Google Chrome could not connect to (ip address)\". I called my folks who's last replacement was version 2  only to find out theirs had developed the same problem as a previous one of the camera continually swivelling around searching. We are fed up giving Foscam a chance and paying for all these return shippings. An original order of 2 Foscams gave way to a total of 5 Foscam units with the replacements, none of which now work.
