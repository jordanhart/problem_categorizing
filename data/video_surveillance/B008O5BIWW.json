This bug exhibits itself by either rebooting, black video or neon colors. Foscam has confirmed the bug and does have a repair procedure in place. Although, users have had varying degrees of friction in processing these repairs. Foscam has responded and claims that all cameras purchased from specific retailers as of November 2013 have the issue 100% resolved. However, new users continue to report faulty cameras from these sources.This bug affects multiple models of Foscam cameras. In an effort to better comply with Amazon review guidelines regarding duplicate information, the details of this bug can be found in the review linked below.http://www.amazon.com/review/R30GQV3F3C8KGX/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN;=B006ZP8UOW&linkCode;=&nodeID;=&tag;=", "Date": "November 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great outdoor PT IP camera", "Author": "Allan Ramiro", "ReviewID": "R3JN5OF3TNGYRZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had my share of experience setting up my zmodo ip camera and when i bought foscams, it was basically the same tango.  I also have a few more foscam  FI8918W whose setup is basically the same for this one. I have set up the camera in my front door so I have a good view of my front lawn and drivewayThe good: - set up was fairly easy once you have experience. but if you don't have any experience yet, be prepared to be challenged.  - I would recommend to watch the installation video twice before attempting to unwrap the package. - the picture is good.  IR is good as well at night. - Pan and tilt works fine and no problem. - Customer support at certain times is here in the US.  I am just amazed when the support is still here in the US! - it does take an IT background before you can set up the wireless settings.  However, by carefully following the installation instructions, you should be able to do it.  Do note that you have an option for foscam support to take over your pc and set it up for you.  will take time though, but they get it done. - As it is an outdoor camera, it should be prepared to get wet.  I have no issues with it when it rains.the bad: - the first i bought had hardware problems wherein the pan and tilt is limited (it would not go past 90 degrees in all direction)  Good thing is that I live in Houston and thus was able to visit their office and had the item replaced with no questions ask.  You do have to report the issue ahead of time. - the first few months was bad as the camera had to be restarted at least 2 times a week.  Imagine being disappointed when you view  your cameras while waiting for an important package.  However, after the latest firmware update, the camera is performing well.- The IR works, but since the IR LED are inside the housing and thus reflects back to the lens, but not that much.  its just like being foggy, but the perimeter is still visible.some tips:- before setting it up in places where you would need to use ladders (or basically before investing any efforts in installing it), or before you configure the camera, I would recommend to flash it first with the latest firmware.  There have been known issues with the earlier shipments of cameras that had issues with the firmware.- the tilt would not go beyond 90 degrees vertically (it can not look up)  so you may need to install it high enough to see around your area. - occasional cleaning of the lens casing may be required to maintain a clear view.  I do it every other month with eyeglasses wipes.  just be careful and do not put excessive pressure on the casing.", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Foscam FI8919W review & IMPORTANT SECURITY INFO", "Author": "Sandy S \"Sandy S\"", "ReviewID": "R3EO85QTHF319H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My Review & IMPORTANT SECURITY INFOI have 11 Foscam cameras (9 are indoor: Foscam FI8910W; and 2 are this model: FI8919W) I have them in 3 different locations/properties. Installation and setup were relatively easy and I HIGHLY recommend watching the how-to videos on the foscam.us site and search for: MJPEG Setup VideosOne of the locations that I installed this FI8919W camera is connected to the internet via a Telus modem. Between my son and myself, (both very computer literate), we must have spent a good 10 hours trying to get this camera to work ... in that we could have it recognized while connected to the network ... we had to use our iphones on 3G and then the software would connect to the camera. As soon as we switched off 3G and connected via wifi, the camera would disappear. Yes, we tried everything conceivable with respect to port forwarding; DDNS; etc., etc. ... in the end we had to create 2 installations - one for wifi and one for 3G. Anyway, that seems to be more of an issue with the Telus modem/router than with the Foscam camera, as all of the other locations (using different service providers) do not have this issue.So why am I only giving this camera 3 stars you ask? Well, for one thing, the more I learn about Foscam, the less I respect the company. First of all, while searching around for a fix to the above problem, I came across a site ( informationweek . com) (search for: Wireless Camera Flaws Allow Remote Exploitation) ... article written April 16, 2013 ... the article warns, in part that:  \"...Foscam have a firmware vulnerability that would allow an attacker to bypass security defenses and remotely steal credentials stored on the device...\"  \"...prior to firmware version 11.37.2.49...\"  So I checked my cameras and found that: 8 were running .49 / 2 were running .52 / 1 was running .54.  Okay, no big deal ... I went into the camera's software > Device Management > Upgrade Device Firmware ... and from there you find 2 options to browse your hard drive for the files to update firmware and web UI. Really? There was not link to the site to download latest firmware. There was no option i.e.: check for latest upgrade ... whatever. So the user has go to the Foscam site and *sign up* for the right to download the upgrades. In the authentication email that is then sent to your email address, it reads in part:****We received your request for the latest Foscam firmware.  Before we send you the download links we want to be certain we have your permission. Please note that by confirming you agree that, in addition to receiving firmware updates, you may receive emails regarding product updates and discount coupon codes.Please click the link below to confirm and then we will send you the firmware and discounts by email. Thanks!*****Really, Foscam? I have to agree to accept promotional emails from you before you will allow me to secure my camera from unauthorized access?  Okay ... whatever ... I hit the link and was taken to the site to download the updates ... BUT first I wanted to see what's new with the latest updates ... so I read the ReadMe.txt that was included in the download. One of the things that it fixes is: Fix the bug that no need to do authentication when using some CGI commandshmmmm.... interesting ... so I did a google search for [ Foscam Fix the bug that no need to do authentication when using some CGI commands ] and found a very interesting article written just one month ago - Jan 24/14 on pcworld.com. In that article the author writes about a search engine called Shodan (The Dark Google) ... and how this search engine can allow users to find and infiltrate various devices connected to the internet. Not only will the hackers be able to control your cameras (watch you) ... they can get access to your entire system. You need to take precautions ... i.e., download the latest camera firmware updates and be creative with your username and passwords. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you google the following keywords: [ CNN money Shodan: The scariest search engine on the Internet ] and watch the video by David Goldman.  Then if you have the cameras or are thinking of buying one ... be sure to immediately change the default username and passwords and fill in all 8 user/password options under Device Management > User Settings- also change the default port for remote access and regularly check the camera\u2019s logs, which can reveal unauthorized access attempts.So in conclusion, I will say that these are fairly good cameras for the money. I would probably buy more if needed, however, I wish the company made the upgrades more user friendly and not require the customers to jump through hoops to get the upgrades.", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great picture, but mine is wired.", "Author": "George Pinson", "ReviewID": "R1R4DB19VT7ZDZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "1st, I have not tried this camera in wireless mode.

Mr. Foster was very helpful and courteous. One small improvement to the product would be the ability to tilt the cam up 90~100 degrees so I can look up.

The first one worked for two days, I called Foscam support and they could not get it to restart so I had to call and get an RMA number and return it. I received shipping return confirmation and waited to receive email new camera was on the way. After multiple calls and emails proving they had received the return they sent a new one slow boat, so I was without product for 2 weeks.  I spent a afternoon reconfiguring the new camera and testing it in the house before I mounted it high on garage. Camera would move to a point and then would stop rotation, lock up and drop off line.  I rebooted many times all with same results, it would rotate to a point stop and disconnect.  I called support they confirmed and said camera would have to come down and be plugged into router to test. I had to climb up on garage to remove, so I told support to call me back in 10 minutes while I climbed ladder and removed camera.  Never got all call back, so I called them again got another person who went through test said camera was working fine, so I climbed ladder and reinstalled only to have camera freeze up again.

Beautiful clear picture like all of their cameras but the problem is in the pan-tilt mechanism. The lens will tilt to 90 degrees but cannot see the horizon due to the magnification of the lens. After multiple e-mails with detailed pictures and multiple calls I was sent a replacement that did the same thing, it is a design flaw. I have spent endless hours on the phone and sending e-mails to their customer support to return the 2nd camera but there is a severe language barrier that results in wasted time and frustration. I finally reached a supervisor after multiple days of waiting for call backs that never came and was told the issue would be resolved. When the support person e-mailed me it was the same problem.

I bought it directly from Foscam.  This camera was my first foray into security cameras for my home.  My concept was to install 1 camera on opposite corners of the house, thereby having a full 360 degree sight around the house.  I also purchased this model because it was wireless (WIFI capable) and as such all I would need to do is have electricity nearby to power the camera.  Additionally, I wanted to be able to view the feed, and control the camera remotely, either via remote PC, or smart phone.  Overall, the functionality is workable, but frustrating.Well\u2026 here is the stuff they don\u2019t tell you.  It\u2019s wireless, and so far seems to work fine with my WIFI, however, I needed Foscam to set up the remote access because the manual doesn\u2019t address that.  It locks onto to your WIFI signal fairly easily, but its the remote viewing/operation that is the problem (router, firewall, etc.).  Also, because its wireless, you can mount it just about anywhere.  I mounted the first one on the corner of the house, at the roof line, in order to get a good view of all surrounding areas.  It was a pain retrofitting a mounting solution because its not really made for mounting on a corner, and I had to buy a separate corner mount bracket from a 3rd party suppler because Foscam doesn\u2019t offer such a bracket.  OK, so I finally get it mounted (after major retrofitting) and all is well\u2026 until I discovered there is a hardware update available for the camera.  No problem right\u2026 wrong !  The update cannot be applied via WIFI.  Are you kidding me !  So, how am I supposed to update the camera???  I bought a WIFI camera so I didn\u2019t have to run LAN cable to the camera because its in such an out of the way location it would be nearly impossible to run cable to it.  That issue is still unresolved as of this date, and of course, its not been updated yet.Video quality.  Under ideal conditions, the picture quality is great.  The directional capabilities for viewing the surrounding area is great (in part due to the corner mount).  However\u2026 nighttime viewing is not so great.  It has infrared capability, and can see at night, but there are some challenging situations that make the feature less than optimal, or even meet some expectations.  First, there are halo type glow spots on the video feed in nighttime situations.  I was told by Foscam support that this is a result of the infrared lights reflecting on the inside of the glass globe protecting the lens.  I notice it more when the lens is pointed almost horizontal to level.  So, unless you are mounting this thing way WAY up high, you will likely run into this problem.  Its annoying, and could possibly obscure something you would want to see, such as a person\u2019s face if it were to be present in one of the areas obscured by the halo.  The situation is worse in the rain.  This issue does not affect the entire viewing area, but none the less, its annoying.Rain and snow\u2026 REALLY obscures the picture quality, especially at night.  Additionally, depending on the sensitivity of the alerts, will more than likely set off an alert if at night mostly.  If you are like me, I have the alerts sent to my email, you will be annoyed by the frequency of the false alerts.  One day I awoke to over 75 alerts in my email.  Yes, I could reduce the sensitivity of the alert trigger, however I have found that where I have the camera mounted related to the area I want viewed, I need the alerts set at #7 (out of 10) in order to trigger the alert of a human walking in that area.  Now, I turn off the alerts at night if its raining or snowing.  (note to thieves\u2026 pay no attention to the this).Also, I have a bird feeder in the viewing area.  During the daytime birds flying to and from the feeder will set off the alert.  One night there was some kind of bug flying around the lens setting off an alert.  Also, alerts seem to be triggered more by horizontal activity rather than vertical activity.  When the camera is pointed at my driveway, no alert is triggered by a car leaving the driveway, however cars driving down the street will trigger an alert.  The viewing area of the street is less than 10% of the viewing area (at the top of the picture), while the area viewed with my driveway is 90%... yet a car moving horizontally across the 10% of the area triggers the alert.  If no car is traveling down the road in front of my house, then my car leaving the driveway will not trigger an alert.I am also experiencing problems with alert video recording.  More times than not I will get an email alert, but no video is captured (only still pictures).  For instance, one morning I awoke to over 75 alerts\u2026 not one minute of video was captured, only stills.  However I have had the video alert recording to work, I just can figure out how to make it work on every alert.  Why have an alert if you can\u2019t record the event.  Stills are better than nothing, however the stills are sequenced at user defined intervals.  If I knew how long an intruder was staying, I could better determine how to set the interval frequency.  (note to thieves\u2026 please call ahead and let me know how long you will be staying).Overall I am satisfied, yet disappointed at the same time.  What I have now is 100% more than I had, however its frustrating that the problems cannot be resolved.  I can now view the video feed from any computer anywhere, and even on my smart phone, which again is a vast improvement over not being able to see anything previously, and for that I don\u2019t regret the effort and expense to install the camera.  I have yet to purchase the second camera for the other corner of the house.  I have seen they have a new model (F18928W I believe is the number), and I am likely to wait for that model in hopes maybe they have resolved some of the issues described above.  Perhaps if you purchased say the F19805W model you might not encounter the nighttime visibility issues I have experienced, however I wanted the pan and tilt capabilities and for that I needed to get the F18919W model.  Supposedly the new model also has a zoom feature.  A zoom feature would be a added bonus that I would find desirable.

With every loop the presets drift.  After an hour the presets are completely lost.  About 30 days later, the presets stopped working all together.  My guess is Foscam uses a cheap motor that is imprecise and does not last long.  Also good engineering practice would be to use feedback so that the software actually knows what direction the camera is pointing and then can close the loop to correct position.  But I think they don't use feedback, so the software does not actually know where the camera is pointing.  So errors just accumulate.  That is like blindly following turn-by-turn driving directions, but not being able see out the front window of your car.

The problem is there is no way to control how much data the camera sends over your wireless network (unless you want to spend the time setting up QoS on your router) so the cameras will flood your wifi network until there is no bandwidth left for anything else.They cannot use the 5GhZ band, so that means you are stuck using the already crowded 2.4GhZ band which (unless you are using two channels) tops out at 54Mb/s. I live in a suburban area that has free public WiFi so that leaves only 40Mhz (two full non-overlapping channels) for everyone else, which isn't too crowded. If you live in a densely populated area you will be lucky if you can get one of these cameras to run over wireless.The camera's video stream is raw MPEG with no compression, which is why they are such bandwidth hogs. I have three of them and I started out running them wirelessly but because they flooded my 2.4GhZ network to the point where it was unusable by any other device and they fight each other for bandwidth, I ended up running cables to hard wire them. Another thing to keep in mind is that because the network is flooded, sometimes the cameras seem to give up and Blue Iris will loose video. If you read the other reviews on here where people are complaining they have to constantly reset the cameras, most likely their wifi is flooded and the camera cannot maintain the stream. Rebooting the camera will fix it for a brief period. Reducing the resolution or frame rate of the cameras does not seem to decrease their network usage.Overall, I like the cameras but keep in mind that if you have more than one you should probably consider running the CAT 5 cable or your wireless network will likely be unusable.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Ehhhhhhhh", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "RQX8EV28OGIWM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Not too impressed with this guy here.
