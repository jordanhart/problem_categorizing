{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A camera that pans, tilts, offers images that show up on your PC or smartphone, records, and has night  vision...it does it ALL", "Author": "Chandler", "ReviewID": "R1HVTNMUQRL23T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very high-end camera in comparison to many I have tried. In fact, you can stalk your own pets while at work from your mobile device and find out which dog it was that really knocked over the trash can.  All kidding aside, you actually can monitor your home or work from your wireless device, making your eyes stay wherever you desire even when you leave.You can either capture images or you see them in real time.For remote monitoring, it captures images in the Cloud and you can view images on your PC, smartphone, or tablet...making monitoring more discreet and easier than ever and you are able to view the images instantly rather than having to download them and wait.This has motion detection so let's say your office is closed or you are away on vacation...it alerts you to motion detection and records.  Now you have far better protection to ensure you lose nothing to change and no belongings...you always have eyes watching, even after work hours or during travel.Even for monitoring your own office or a baby's room, having this feature gives you something you might not find in other units that may be very important to your peace of mind.This has both two way audio and night vision as well as day vision too...always covered.So let's get down to how it actually performs outside of the features it offered.  The images it captured for me, on the ceiling of a shipping department were clear, crisp and without fail.  The distance covered was actually greater than I expected with clarity and the install was a snap.  However, I had already learned to install surveillance units prior to this one but it had very precise directions.With night vision, it is often hit or miss as to the capturing of images as far as clarity goes but this pulled through and never missed the mark, offering performance in a wide variety of lighting situations from cloudy to sunny to night to morning.This camera tilts and does more, for more security.Camera provided by DB Roth.
