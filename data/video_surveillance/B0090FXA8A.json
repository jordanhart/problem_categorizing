The quality of the cameras and system are OK, but when you think you are getting Sony and receive Chinese knock-offs, it is a bit annoying.Don't buy if you are thinking you are going to get something high quality, but they will do the job...

I am not very good with electronics at all , I have to get my 16 year son to help me , but even he has trouble with this one . The Problem is you need a master degree to understand the manual , reads like submarine Manual . Can not understand it at all . Tried to record ,screen says recording but when I tried to replay it , it said nothing had been recorded . I went to Zmodo web site and tried talking online to someone I was waiting so long that just said please leave a email and someone would be in touch . Its been 4 days and still no response . If you can figure out hour it works please let me Know . As far as I am concern it has been a waste of my money !ZMODO 4CH H.264 Surveillance CCTV DVR System with 4 Sony CCD Night Vision Outdoor Security Cameras - 1TB Hard Drive Pre-installed", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great video picture.", "Author": "BillT \"BillT\"", "ReviewID": "R29XBJJ9F45937", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a nice system.

Maybe a little bit more in this case. Let me say, I maybe should go with four stars.The cameras and DVR are easy to install. Very easy. The DVR is super simple to set up. I had the entire system up and running in less than 3 hours. That is with 2 trips to the hardware store for wire ties and odds and ends finishing items (to hide wires and such). My wife was navigating the DVR within minutes if its set-up. In day light the cameras are ok...colors are close, one could identify a passing vehicle by color and model and even make if you know cars. It is definitely a starting point for detectives. At night , however, there are issues. Not any that aren't inherent in most IR cameras, but IR washout on two of my cameras are more than the other 2. In the end I am happy with the purchase. I would recommend it. I believe for under $250 it's worth having ANY evidence if you are burglarized or worse (I was shot at). Plus, cameras are a deterrent to theft at the very least. But lastly, if you want a 5 star system, they cost quite a bite more. As for mobile viewing (here is why I give 3 stars), getting your system to come up on your phone isn't hard if you are on your own wi-Fi (why do i need this. I'm at home) I cannot, after several weeks of trying different things, get it on 4g. Zmodo has tech support but after 18 minutes I gave up. Bottom line...it's affordable, it's easy, it's somewhat limited, but it is worth the investment.", "Date": "March 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "I really love this survellance camera very clear and accurate..
