It is well built, has lots of options.  I am super impressed with their technical support, it is second to none and USA based.  I would recommend anyone to buy this unit and your own hard drive and buy the cameras separately searching for Sony Effio 700 TVL.  The cabling is available separately too and the only other things you need is a power supply for the cameras.  All in all and awesome product.  Forget the rest and buy this one.Thanks, Steve", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great DVR", "Author": "E. Arquette", "ReviewID": "R3D4MCAO0XPUPS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We ordered this after our last Q-See DVR stopped working after 6 years.At first, we had a lot of trouble figuring out exactly how it works lol. We are computer savvy here, but this thing took a lot of trial and error to figure out what everything does. Also, we had a bit of difficulty setting up the LAN to it. That might have just been us though.Overall though, this DVR is great! I absolutely love how easy it is now to review the playback. In fact it's actually kind of fun. Only recording when movement is sensed makes it SO much easier to review your video footage. Our old DVR didn't have anything like that, and reviewing footage on that last one was a nightmare. This one is superb.The video quality with HDMI is great too. We use it at the lowest available HDMI resolution and with our decent Sony camera's, the picture looks great. In fact, we had an event last summer where vandals destroyed over 90 mailboxes in our area, and our footage ended up on CBS and ABC. The camera guys for those networks couldn't believe how great our cameras looked. Here's a link to that video - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzkPAJmRJ9AChecking out our cameras on our iPhones and Ipods is easy and quick, about 5 seconds from when you open the app on your phone or tablet.Also, I am amazed at how far back you can go with this DVR. We installed a 500 GB hard drive and we can seriously look over camera footage from early November and it hasn't wiped itself yet.All in all we are extremely happy with this DVR. We aren't professionals with this kind of thing, just a family that has had a series of events over the years that made us want to have surveillance... and this works great for that.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Faulty DVR, bad support", "Author": "sloop \"sloop\"", "ReviewID": "R3SINUGD7H52V7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The DVR stopped recognizing the hard drive after 2 days.  I tried other hard drives that were known to be good and bought new cables.  Support said they would 'escalate' to level 2 but they never called back.I bought from the manufacturer web site.  There is no phone number on the web site until you register a product which you don't have until you buy.  The support group sends you to pre sales that cannot help with returns.  Pre sales sends you to the 'web store' group who have no phone number.  The online RMA process gets you no response when you open one.  You pay for return shipping and wait a long, long time before getting your refund, minus a hefty restocking fee.I bought a Swann.  If i have problems with it, I know I can contact them for support.  I would not recommend this product or any product from this company.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$149.99", "Features": "8 Channel Smart DVR (No Hard Drive Included)^HDMI Output for easy connection to any TV or Monitor^960 H Recording Capabilities^No monthly fees^24/7 Technical Support\n8 Channel Smart DVR (No Hard Drive Included)\nHDMI Output for easy connection to any TV or Monitor\n960 H Recording Capabilities\nNo monthly fees\n24/7 Technical Support", "Name": "Night Owl Security PE-DVR8 8-Channel DVR System with HDMI Output and 960H Recording (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41hCYhYVhZL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00EDU4XVK"}}
