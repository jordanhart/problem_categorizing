{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Product - Free online cloud storage of video - BRILLIANT", "Author": "Coaster8717", "ReviewID": "R2LIM0CDOMVOX6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For years people have been wondering when a company will release a home surveillance solution that allows the recorded footage to be stored online without having to pay through the roof for it. Say hello to Y-Cam's HomeMonitor HD. Priced at \u00a3149.99 it is a little more expensive that the Dropcam HD but comes in much cheaper than Logitech's 750n Indoor Master System. One of the best features abut the HomeMonitor HD is that straight out of the box it comes with 7 days free cloud storage - absolutely no subscription or payment needed.--------------------------Whats In The Box?--------------------------- 1x HomeMonitor HD Camera- 1x Metal stand/wall/ceiling mount- 1x 3m/10ft power supply with UK/US/EU plug attachments- 1m/3ft network Ethernet cable- 2x 1-inch screws- 2x fluted plastic wall anchorsThe camera itself measures 3.3 x 3.3 x 1.2 inches (Height x Width x Depth) but also has a 1-inch wireless antenna on the top. The HomeMonitor HD Camera sits in between the HomeMonitor Indoor (\u00a3129.99) and the HomeMonitor Outdoor (\u00a3199.99), but all use the same online service.--------------------------Setup--------------------------Setting up the camera is an absolute breeze. The included documentation lists in detail everything you need to do whether you are going to be using the camera wired or wireless. It basically requires you to hook up the camera to a mains power supply, and also to your router using the ethernet port on the back of the camera. When creating an account on the HomeMonitor website you'll be asked to enter the Camera ID which can be found on the camera or on the information booklet included. From here you'll be taken through a few more steps where you can configure some camera settings.While I was setting up the camera I found it to be a smooth process and didn't run into any problems at all. I connected the camera to my router and after around 3/4 minutes the camera showed a green LED to show that it was connected and working correctly. One thing I would like to see in any future additions is WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) to make the process even easier.Among the settings that you can change are those for motion detection. You are allowed to create two motion detection zones wherever your camera is pointed. This means that any movement not in these zones will not trigger the camera to start recording. From our tests this can be very useful when you have multiple people moving around and can set the camera to start recording for example when a door is opened. Not only this but a slider can be used to change the amount of movement needed to trigger the camera. You can also schedule these zones so they will only be looking for detection at certain times.Once the setup is completed you will be taken to your homepage when you can switch between different tabs including Live View, Video Archive, User Manager and Camera Manager. Live View is exactly what it sounds like and allows you to see a 'live' feed from your camera. The only problem with this is that it isn't exactly live. We found there to be quite a bit of lag when it came to viewing the camera live, and although we knew that there would be some lag due to the video being sent via the internet we didn't realise just how much, but by no means is it a major drawback in my books.Using the video manager you can view all of your captured video's from the past 7 days that have been stored in the cloud. There are a number of actions you can carry out including deleting all clips, deleting an individual clip and also downloading a clip. All of the clips are arranged by date and it is extremely easy to navigate through them using the time-stamps and duration of the clip.The User Manager tab can be used the change your password but also add multiple emails which allows different people to log onto the dashboard and access all of this information including the video files - another nice feature.From the Camera Manager you can see all the information about a certain camera, and have the option to add more cameras. This is another great thing about HomeMonitor, you can manage multiple cameras from one account, even when placed in different locations.You can access your camera(s) from just about anywhere, with the quality apps that are available for iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Roku, which means you can watch your clips in HD on the big screen. The apps are clean and crisp and do exactly what they are supposed to. The UI works well and is easy to navigate even the first time you ever use it.--------------------------Pros--------------------------- Great night vision mode, thanks to the infra-red lights- FREE cloud storage for the past 7 days- Free companion applications for iOS, Android, Windows Phone & Roku- Add multiple cameras to one HomeMonitor account--------------------------Cons--------------------------- Live Stream lags- Only one way audio--------------------------Our Verdict--------------------------Overall the new HomeMonitor HD is a quality and solid product. It is meant to be a security / monitoring system and therefore the lag in the video feed doesn't really matter. The night vision mode thanks the the infra-red lights works absolutely brilliantly and you still get a clear, crisp image. The apps for all platforms are on par with each other and function exactly how they should. Overall I would recommend this product to anybody looking for an easy to set-up wireless monitoring system. Although not being cheap you would pay this money back to the companies such as Dropcam and Logitech when paying for their cloud storage subscription fees.", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Already buying a second one and will probably get a third", "Author": "J. Parnell", "ReviewID": "R13M00ZKO45MPM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I agree with everything the great review Roundreviews did.  I currently have one camera in my laundry room facing the back door. I like it so much I bought a second to monitor the front and garage door.  As the weather warms up I will probably buy a third camera to monitor the back yard and gate from a window.  One other thing I did in the laundry room is put an outdoor patio thermometer on the wall so I can always look in and see that my heat is still running. (Important on days like today where it is going to -12F in Chicago). These cameras give us some security without monthly fees, very timely since the police just alerted everyone to 8 break-ins in the area over the last few weeks.  I did have an earlier version of this camera that was returned because it stopped working after 24 hours, I am hoping they have all the kinks worked out in the new HD Version. So far so good.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "bad customer service", "Author": "CHARLES PRUITT", "ReviewID": "R3DYROYRQK0MME", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "One camera installed and worked fine.  The video and recording features work fine.The second camera was a dud, did not work.  You cannot call HomeMonitor, you can email only. If they deem your matter worthy of a phone call, they will email you a number to call, They trouble shoot with a series of emails from Customer Service.t's been 13 days since HomeMonitor Customer Service agreed I had a faulty camera and that I would receive a replacement, still no replacement.You can call their US based fulfillment company but they do not have any in stock to ship the replacement.You pay the freight to ship a return and then apply for reimbursement. Unusual.Customer Service for returns is far too slow for what Amazon customers are accustomed to receiving.Maybe I should have returned the unit to Amazon instead of listening to the manufacture's return instructions.", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "So THAT'S Who's Been Dumping the Garbage!", "Author": "MrJumbo", "ReviewID": "R1MGH4UVPL3MOZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Camera has been great. From a second-story window, resolution is good enough to recognize cars, not good enough to read license plates. You can recognize your neighbors from their clothes and how they walk. Since our camera is indoors, we don't turn on the infrared lights at night, and this picks up a surprising amount of activity, in surprising detail, with only streetlight illumination. (Still much better by day.) Built-in microphone picks up sound quite nicely, but again, since our camera is inside, we have the sound turned off. Setup was easy, and the camera is a good network neighbor, not hogging bandwidth or slowing down other devices.

This means no matter how many cameras you have, after the first camera initiates a push notification or email, your account is blocked from sending any more push notifications or emails for the next 15 minutes no matter how many other cameras are triggered. If you get an alert push notification or email, you need to manually monitor all of your cameras for the next 15 minutes till your account is unblocked.  I spoke to Tech Support and they said that they are working on changing this but it is what it is for now! Y-CAM needs to fix this right away, what the heck were they thinking?? I don't remember seeing this fact clearly advertised on the camera box or their web site.  If you don't like this either, please contact Tech Support let them know that this is totally unacceptable!!original review:These cameras were very easy to set up thru Y-Cam's home monitor web site.  They make it easy to access your cameras thru the iPhone app, including viewing all recorded events.  The cameras have 2 moveable adjustable size detection zones which is great.  You can set the sensitivity of the zones to be activated by small to large movements.  I currently have four cameras inside my home and two cameras outside of my house (in Y-Cam outdoor housings).  I am very happy with the camera build and video quality and the performance of the app and cloud service.  The free 7 day unlimited events cloud recording on each camera was the deal sealer for me.  I would recommend these cameras to anyone wanting a quality product with an app and cloud service that really work well.", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Day 1 - Staring at a blinking red light", "Author": "Colette Ivanov", "ReviewID": "R8FK8CD2UJJDG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "June 5, 2014Received the order in 2 days as expected (thanks Amazon Prime!).Hooked it up, waited for the flashing red light to turn green.

Such an easy setup, literally only takes 5-10 mins, and boom, your place is under surveillance! Hasn't let me down yet on detecting movement when it's on, and clearly capturing what's going on. Night vision works awesome too. Clearer than actual lighting footage. The best part though?...

Other wifi gadgets connect to my wifi without problems, this didn't. It detected my network but would not connect automatically. I fiddled with router settings as per the guidance. Eventually decided to connect using a wired TP Link nework adapter, instant success and a reliable connection that doesn't drop.Once connected the camera is excellent. The wide angle allows me to get good coverage. The 7 day cloud storage of video clips is a really useful service that works well. The mobile app lets me view the live camera, or the video archive while away from home. You don't need wifi for this, it works over 3G.  The camera has many uses: just checking the timestamps in the archive list to see when a family member arrived or departed; watching to see if the family pet is OK; checking on an elderly relative; oh, and of course spotting a burglar!Settings allow one to toggle on/off an email alert when the camera is triggered.  A useful addition would be the facility to specify a time interval and request an email if the camera has NOT triggered, e.g. no movement by 10 am. In this way it could be used to monitor whether an elderly person is up or not.All in all very pleased with this device.", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great product.", "Author": "Dave.

I bought it to have a extra camera i can move around the building as i wanted because all it needs is a plug in spot and it automatically connects and uploads to the website.  It also came with a 7 day recording loop for free which the other web cams wanted to charge for so that was nice.To set it up it was super easy, it took about 5 minuets because i was able to get at my router easily which you will have to plug it in for the initial setup.  I then set it up and played with the motion sensors which it give you the option of 2 motion sensor zones to activate recording.  Because it is so simple and user friendly it will fit the requirements i have for it but it in no way is able to capture sharp faces, or license plates on the street (30 yards away)  I put it up high in my building to capture the front door and the stair case and i like the fact that this camera will send me a message when it sees motion but not just any motion just in the zones i established which is over my door and the racks under the stairs.This evening it went in to night vision and the video is very basic, not very sharp but at a distance of about 60' i can see the shelves and the door, i may be able to recognize someone i know already but would definitely not be able to see a face or any license plates that pull up.I would suggest this if you want a simple quick easy camera especially if you can place it close to where you want to record, but for a overall security camera it will not work well at all.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "The best Home security camera IMO", "Author": "bill \"Pie Are Squared\"", "ReviewID": "R2CC4OPGPIWWF4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is just great!
