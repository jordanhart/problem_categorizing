You need a basic knowledge of port forwarding on a router or it will not work.The cameras are mediocre quality picture wise but you can see. I don't think they could last a month outdoors. If you need outdoor cameras, these will rot before sun up.So, the system works with your intuitive extensive IT abilities. The cameras work but don't ask me to pick someone from a police line up-they all look alike. Stay indoors.I guess the next option up will triple the price but they will see your face, last years outside and have trouble free viewing.", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "All 8 cameras were defective.", "Author": "DEBRA K.", "ReviewID": "R3CE4UO6FOEZLX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "All 8 cameras were defective.  I have been trying to get my cameras with this system along with 4 from another system replaced for over 3 months.  All the cameras and the VCR from the other system were defective.  You would think after purchasing two systems and receiving over 90% of it defective that they would be very cooperative in getting you replacements ASAP.  Over three months and many letters and phone calls and I still have a VCR that supposedly had the hard drive replaced that still doesn't work properly and can't seem to get the company to replace the cameras.  They currently have one of my cameras that they tested, which they lost at one time.  The agreement was if this camera was bad they were going to send me replacements.  They changed their mind.  There is a one year warranty on their product, but doesn't seem to be true.  Don't buy this system!!!  The product is lacking and they certainly don't stand behind their warranties.", "Date": "November 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "we caught neighbor breaking into other neighbor's car", "Author": "atireman4u", "ReviewID": "R1UKH1LTA3J630", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A must have for every home. if something happens then just view footage.  law enforcement liked it too. easy to use", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "EXCELENT", "Author": "HASSAN AYOUB", "ReviewID": "R2K7NEWF7FZZ6I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very good product, the cameras despite being small fully comply with its purpose, the image quality is unmatched, the DVR with 1TB hard drive is more than enough, the installation is easy, and also settings, cables electricity and video are of excellent quality, the only thing I did not like was the packaging of the cameras, very poor, should improve the packaging:", "Date": "February 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$444.47", "Features": "Long time recording: - Base on the H.264 Compression, maximize the hard drive's recording time, as well as transfer video for viewing over the internet.\nNetwork Remote Access - Access live video footage directly from your mobile phone or PC anytime anywhere\nAdvanced Motion Detection Recording - This allows you record only when motion is detected.\nInstant Email Alerts if Activity Detected - This system is designed to send an email alert, complete with photo of the activity, if any motion is detected, or if any camera experiences video loss.\n4 Professional Grade Weather Resistant Cameras - See in the Dark with Automatic Night Vision up to 65ft.", "Name": "Zmodo 16CH H.264 Video DVR Security Surveillance Camera System With 8 Night Vision IR Outdoor Surveillance Camera 1TB Hard Drive", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51jeQQX8iWL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00ABUOGM2"}}
