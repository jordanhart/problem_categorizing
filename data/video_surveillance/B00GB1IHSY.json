It seemed like the remote viewing didn't really work on droid mobile devices.I had enough of trying to figure it out and found the company website [...] and submitted a request for help.  It took a bit of back and forth, but they were able to fix all of the issues (happened to be outdated remote monitoring apps) and were very helpful.I originally would not have recommended this DVR...but, after getting some help and getting it up and running, I would definitely recommend it.Good price, good product...just be ready to maybe download / install a different app than expected / provided...and maybe keep their website handy!", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "With newest third generation P2P/ Plug and play in security industry, no need to set DNNS and network port\nyou just need to install the client application to remote view from PC, scan QR Code to view live video from Smartphone\nEmail alarm and SMS alarm function\nMotion detective\nWith HDMI Port", "Name": "SANNCE HDMI 8CH H.264 Realtime P2P&QR Code Standalone DVR with Phone View for Home Security Surveillance Cameras System (Black )", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31q5hVT2RUL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00GB1IHSY"}}
