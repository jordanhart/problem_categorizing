While I'm there, I'll take this camera back. Buying a security camera is like buying a mattress - there's a million models and everybody who buys one thinks it's great. My point is: you can't trust reviews. So you'll probably take this one with a grain of salt too. I have been doing video surveillance installations for about 5 years (I have been in the data / I.T./ Low voltage wiring trade for 20 years) and have used a variety of entry level cameras ($150 or less). So here's my honest professional opinion of this camera. Pros: The color rendering was good and it appears to have the stated resolution and lens. Cons: The mount won't allow the camera to tilt to compensate for a compound angle (can't fix the horizon line). The mount doesn't protect the camera cable. Night vision is atrocious - 15 feet at best. It should be priced at about $59.99 retail. Please don't buy this.

During the day the wide angle lense offers a sensational wide view of whatever you point it at with crisp colors and great view. This camera make no mistake about it is everything the ad says.

Davis", "ReviewID": "R3IC1WKK20MHB8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had 3 wide-angle black & white cameras on my home video surveillance system that I wanted to upgrade.  I decided to order one of these cameras to try.  The resolution is not outstanding, but is much better than my old cameras and much nicer to be in color.  I imagine the electronics in my DVR have some bearing on what the final resolution looks like on the monitor.What I am most amazed by is the performance at night.  I have one camera mounted in a side yard of my house.  At night the yard almost looks like it's daytime.  Two other cameras cover large lawn areas.  I would say that, if it was not for the fact that the cameras are pointed downward because they are wide-angle, they would probably illuminate out to nearly 100 feet.I noticed one of the other reviews made a negative comment about the picture at night not being in color.  It is important to realize that images from a camera that sees in infrared will only be in black & white.  The camera has a light sensor which obviously switches it to infrared when it gets dark.As far as construction quality, I have no complaints.  After I bought the first camera, I bought 2 more.  It's nice to sit at my desk at night and be able to see the areas that my cameras cover.  I am quite happy with this new addition to my home surveillance system.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Video security Camera", "Author": "JRM \"JRM in Ohio\"", "ReviewID": "R3KKD41KNCHALJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this unit mostly because of the wide angle and the high res features.  I'm using it to monitor my driveway and it's doing just the job I hoped it would do.  It does a fair job with IR, and very clear picture.  Will likely buy another one for another use.  Note that it does not come with long wires.  The power supply is about 5' and that's it.  Likely you'll need to explore some kind of cord to get the video output where you need it.
