Do not look here!This system is for those that are budget minded.The options are difficult and not intuitive but perfectly serviceable.Things are labelled with poor translations.The DVR is pretty good despite all that.Actually the DVR is the best part of the system.If they would just update the firmware to fix the translations and make it a bit more user friendly it would be a decent DVR.I wish you the world of luck trying to update the firmware though.The cameras on the other hand are just poor quality.They are loud when they switch from color regular light to b&w; IR night vision.The light sensitivity is way off with no way to adjust it.When it is perfectly light out it switches in and out of IR constantly.I am talking full blown daylight at noon and if a cloud blocks 1% of the light suddenly its b&w.;That is going to play havoc on its durability to be switching modes every couple of minutes.There is NO adjustment for that.The remote viewing stuff took a good bit of firewall work.Port mapping, port forwarding, etcI would suggest it not be behind a firewall if your not technical.There is different versions of the plugin for it.You might have to search quite a bit for the newer version that works on newer OSs.Having said all that you get what you pay for and if you need a cheap system it is workable.It would not have taken a huge amount of effort on their to make this a much better system..", "Date": "March 14, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00I1UCZOA"}}
