I bought one for myself and one for a family member.  When I received it, I put it in an upstairs bedroom and partially opened the blinds.  I plugged it in and set the timer to dusk + 7 hours.  Other settings are dusk all nite, dusk + 4 hours, dusk +7, or always on.  That evening, I was outside and was amazed.  It looked like there was a tv on in the bedroom.  It changed light intensity and colors like a real tv.  My wife was appreciative because it gives her an added sense of deterrent which means a lot to me.  What is impressive is that the lighting of the faketv can be extremely bright like any tv would be.  However, the fake tv utilizes intensely bright LEDs that hardly uses any electricity but is a lot less than a regular tv or the high energy consumption that high definition tv uses.  During the day, about 3 blue leds are always on to let you know that it is operating and will turn on at dusk.  I am going to order another one for my mother because I know she would appreciate it.  I would suggest for the best location would be in a window that is not near a street light.", "Date": "September 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Kept My House From Being Broke Into", "Author": "G. Hect \"Retired\"", "ReviewID": "R2E3Y70KXSHTFF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought a Fake TV last year when we went to Florida for the winter.  I also bought/installed 2 Barking Rex motion sensor alarms and installed 4 electronic light timers.  The Fake TV I set up on an electronic timer.We live on a private road with several summer cottages.  While in Florida the neighor across the road (full time resident) and the one next door (summer cottage) got broke into.  Our house was not bothered! When our neighbor came to check on our house he said the Barking Rex scared the crap out of him.  I credit my passive security measures as keeping us from becoming a victim too.The Fake TV and 1 Barking Rex was passed on to my son.  So this year I bought 2 Fake TVs and 2 more Barking Rex alarms while we take an extended vacation.  The new Fake TV now has a timer installed, new and improved.  It can be on full time, come on at dark and stay on for either 4 hours or 7 hours.  There is no need to hook it into a timer.  Nice touch.As a retired police officer I strongly recommend this to anyone that wants to imrove the impression someone is home.  Set it up as instructions indicate to get the best benefit. Add Barking Rex and some light timers and only your neighbors will know you are not home.  We are trying to keep the stranger from breaking in, we trust our neighbors.  The stranger will see the lights coming on and going off, see the Fake TV lights in the window, and if they approach the doors hear a dog barking at them.  Enough to make them move on to a different house.", "Date": "September 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Incredible realism", "Author": "The WB", "ReviewID": "R2MVXDXBB9FC2J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read about this product a number of months ago, thinking this is a great idea in night time home security.  If it truly worked, as claimed, it would be a great devise to deter someone looking to break in while you are away from home overnight.  I just couldn't see how such a small devise could pull off the illusion quality of a television at night convincingly enough to be accepted as real.Taking the plunge, I purchasing one locally and set it up at home.  My son and wife were also present when we did the first round of testing.  Baseline was our 27\" color TV (what the company claims FakeTV is designed to replicate) on in two different rooms.  We went outside and watched for about 5 minutes to see the patterns and brightness of the television coming through the window shades.Next up was FakeTV.  To our amazement, we couldn't tell the difference!  The brightness and patterns looked just like a television being on at night.  The best part -- almost NO power usage, since FakeTV uses hi-intensity LED's for light power.  The timer mechanism of selecting its use are:1) Off totally2) On at dusk (photo-eye operated) for 4 hours3) On at dusk for 7 hours4) On continuously (24/7).I have mine aimed away from the windows, bouncing off a white wall, so there is no way to see the actual unit in operation.  Stealth is the name of the game with this unit.I highly recommend this unit to anyone.  It works so well, I'm going to buy a second unit for a different room in the house.*******4/6/2011 - UpdateI have owned these units for just over a year.  Between my neighbors and myself being out of town for extended periods of time, we have clocked up well over 200 days of use.  The longest was 4(+) months straight this past winter.In a nutshell -- they worked flawlessly. In fact, my neighbor drove to their house from their extended vacation when fake TV was on and commented to his wife \"Did you leave the TV on the whole time we were gone?\"  He forgot all about setting it up in the front bedroom.  They are still that bright, even after all this use.BTW, my neighbor just bought 2 units for themselves.If you are concerned about durability, our long term test has shown that they will last for the duration. My FakeTV's are just as bright today as the first time we used them.", "Date": "February 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "This thing is GREAT!", "Author": "S. W.

What I found though was that it didn't seem as bright as I thought it might be.

Although my intended use for this is not specifically what it was designed for.  I am using it as a prop for television and independent film.

It really does look as though there is a real TV on when viewed from outside.  My wife wasn't too impressed when she first saw it, but then it went on and she's now a believer.  I do wish it didn't need the room to be quite so dark before it starts though.  I can see where this really would work as a burglar deterrent given that any little doubt would cause the thief to move to an easier appearing target.  A red LED status light when in the dusk + 4 hour mode, and blue when in the dusk + 7 mode.  I would purchase this fake TV again.________________I recently loaned this fake TV to my niece who went to family reunion in Minnesota for five days.  She set it up, in an upstairs bedroom. When she returned one of her neighbors thought she had canceled the trip.  This because of what appeared to be activity in the house.  She also had a regular light on a timer downstairs.

I was thinking it would be the size of a toaster or toaster oven but it's more along the size of a Rubik's cube. But don't let the size fool you! After I set it up, I went outside to see how it looks and it looks exactly like a TV is on! I actually bought 2 units and I have them on at different times -- one for the main floor and one for upstairs. The great thing about this device is that you don't have to set it up where there is a real TV (someone from outside doesn't know which rooms you have a TV in!).There are a few settings for how long the device is on based on the built in light sensor. I can't completely recall from memory but I believe they are dusk + 4 hours, dusk + 6 hours, and always on. I have my downstairs unit set to dusk + 4 hours. And I have my upstairs unit set to always on, but I have it plugged into another timer which has it come on around 9pm and off at midnight.Anyway, if you are worried about home security and want comfort when you are out of town -- BUY THIS PRODUCT!

I don't like wasting energy but who wants to deal with a burglarized home?  I was skeptical but pleased to find the fake television device.I use the device on the second floor of my home and, from the outside, it looks like a real television is on inside.  The flashing colors are completely randomized and fade in and out and resemble the workings of a tv.  One of the negatives of the device is that if you had the device on a first floor, I believe it would be much easier to identify that it wasn't the real deal.  On the second floor, however, it is not possible for someone to analyze the shape of the fake tv (which is quite small -- see image gallery for a better idea of what I mean).Another potential negative for users is the thickness of your curtains. My curtains are thick and thick curtains will obstruct the light from the fake television.  You will either need to open the curtains partially or utilize curtains that are of a less dense material.Yet another consideration is that the fake tv requires an outlet to operate. You cannot place batteries in the unit.  If you are going away for an extended period and the electricity goes out, the device is not going to be operational.Despite the issues raised in this review, I do like this tool.  I like that it saves electricity and that it is easily portable. Initially, I was annoyed that I spent so much on something so small but it does seem to fulfill what it is made to do. It has three settings of operation so you can set it and forget it.  I would consider buying this for someone with an unrented property or vacant/vacation home.This product is made in Malaysia.", "Date": "November 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Plenty Bright", "Author": "Patrick Laughlin", "ReviewID": "RU1X961WY56FK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Perhaps because I have just ordered the fake TV and the company now has a brighter version - mine is plenty bright.

This will definitely work a lot better for those that have an upstairs. The downfall I see with this product is that you would need to have your house lights go out at night, so if you're away for several days you'd need a timer, so you could have your interior lights on during the day.Note: in the brief demonstration, I pointed the FakeTv at about a 60 degree angle away from where I was filming.

The patterns of the faketv are not as rapid and quick changing as a real tv, blame it on MTV for the quick changing patterns of modern tv programming.

There's also a regular \"on\" setting for timer use or manual operation. the unit also lights an LED depending on the timer switch (one is red LED and the other BLUE LED) so you can confirm at a glance that you have it set the way you want it.the look is extremely realistic and the light is plenty bright.  and, the unit is nice and compact and the power cord is sufficiently long.one key is to make sure you can't see the unit directly from the outside. I ended up placing it on a window shelf in a 2nd floor room, and placing a box between it and the window, and then one on either side as well (I suppose I could just cut one side off a single box and use that as well, like a diorama would be) -- this ensured the light was not directly visible, and casts a shadow on the window that looks like the light is coming from the back of a TV.  I'm sure you could project it onto a wall facing the window, or other possibilities as well.sure it could be a little less expensive, but the price isn't prohibitive, and the company seems to promise great support as well (e.g. will send a new one if there's any trouble, etc).  and, for the money, it's a great additional deterrent and good value.highly recommended!!!

I walked out to the street and watched my dark house from several locations(much like a home invader or thief might do ). I was very impressed with the look the unit gave and i am pleased with it 100 %. A fake TV playing in the house is much better than a light on in a window. A potential thief wants to hit fast and go.........with the possibility that someone is up late watching TV that may not happen. It makes a person wonder if you are awake versus being sound asleep.We now plug it in and it operates from when we retire for the night until we turn it off in the a m . I realize that it is just one of many steps you can take to keep your name off the victims list. If it keeps a home invader from targeting my home it will be worth much more than the list price.

However, around the edges of the blinds I could not see the light directly, and the flicker off the walls was an exact mimic of a TV set.So, I decided to turn the light toward one of the inside walls...90+ degrees away from the front window, and I placed a potted plant between the light and the window (sitting on a coffee table).  From the outside all I could see then was the flicker of the light as it danced off the walls, and the potted plant covered any direct view of the light.  It works perfectly...!!!A few days ago my motion sensing barking dog, REX, arrived from Amazon.com (read my review).

But sometimes, you've got to out-smart the bear... or find somebody else that is to help you.  If you think you can just take this out of the box, plug it in, slide a switch, point it at a blind or draped covered window 20 feet away, leave all the lights turned brightly on in the room and expect this to make people in the next county believe you're watching TV... you might want to think again before purchasing this!  This item takes some planning and common sense to use properly.All kidding aside (actually, I wasn't kidding)...  If you've got room-darkening blinds or drapes, you'd probably not even see a spotlight through them, let alone a Fake TV.  This produce is meant to be subtle.  If you can't even see your own TV operating (flickering) from outside any way, this definitely won't work for you.  What makes you think this product would do any better?  C'mon... use that noggin on your shoulders.  Some planning or \"arranging\" may need to occur in your specific setting to make this thing \"believable\" to those thinking about using your keepsakes to pawn off for crack.  Thieves still are typically lazy and will move on to an easier target if you do your part, first, and take a little time to set this up properly.  Even just a little flicker might save you from having to make that 911 call when you return from your Bingo night or church's pot-luck supper.In my application, which I use for extended vacations, or even just an evening that I'll be returning after dark... I plug it in, of course, placed on the entertainment center or a stand less than 2 feet in front of the window, angled about 45 degrees off to one side.  It's aimed (up) towards the wall that has my window(s) that I want its blinking to be visible from.  I don't leave any other \"glaring\" lights on in the room either... but there still are some dimmer lights on in the room.  I have only blinds and I \"crack\" them open slightly so the light goes up and through them.  I also have (the advantage of) a gable window that allows the blinking Fake TV's light to reflect off of the vaulted ceiling and this is the most effective application I've found although I've used it successfully in other rooms.  Anybody on the street would think there is somebody home here with the TV on.  You also may need to obscure the area around the sensor (block off with books or a newspaper crumpled up) to ensure it comes on in a lighted room.Try different angles, tilts, blind/drape openings and/or reflecting off ceiling or walls to find the best results.  Of course, if you black-out your windows completely (or don't have any), nothing will work for you.  Then again, a little thought process before you purchase this may save you some trouble (or the need to write negative reviews).  This product may not work in your environment or setting.I've used this product for almost a year now.  It works suitably for my situation and it DOES look like a real TV operating in the room from outside.  There are, however, a couple items I'd like to see changed or added to it.  Of course, these would increase to the already reasonable price this thing now sells for.1.  Have a \"random\" on and off setting still retaining the 4 and 7 hour relative timeframes.2.  Have a variable sensor sensitivity like high, medium and low.3.  And this is really picky... have a 5 or 6 hour setting.  7 hours is still too long even for our winter's early sunsets.  It will remain on till well after midnight here, which is a dead giveaway that I'm really not home if you already know my \"pattern\" or observe my other light timers.Still, I love the Fake TV.

If a burglar were to walk completely up to the downstairs window and listen, and hear no sound, he might realize something isn't quite right.  But for the average troublemakers cruising around in a car looking for an easy target, this would cause them to think twice and probably move on.  It is very small, and very bright.  It does require the room be pitch black before it automatically comes on, or you can use the \"always on\" setting, although I think that would look unnatural if it were on til dawn every single night.

I've actually done surveillance (as a licensed private investigator here in Texas) and have written in reports and synopsis that residences where surveillance has been conducted, \"revealed television set was on, inside the house.\"  I was even able to tell what TV station the set was on... long story and you don't need the details...To me, as I set this device up inside my home and went outside to monitor the effectiveness of this device, IT LOOKED REAL TO ME!This tiny unit flashes illumination inside the room and colors change (from greens, to white, to blues and others) and it perfectly imitates a television being viewed. The trick is to place it so it illuminates a wall or drapes and make certain it can't be seen by a passerby.It was so convincing to me, I ordered a second one to put in my 5th wheel RV. Now, when we are gone, it looks like someone is not only inside our home watching TV, but it also appears we have guests staying in the RV...I am delighted in this product...

Its operation would be similar to night lights you might have plugged in around the house. When you have it on the dusk + 7 hour setting, it has a low blue led always on to indictae that it is in that mode. If you choose the dusk + 4 hours, the led is red. Very useful setting to now that the unit is operational when you set it and leave the house.If you do not like those options you can set it on a timer plug and have it set on the always on mode so when the plug switches on, the unit will go on.For power consumption, the unit barely registers on the killawat in standby mode and when its on, it consumes less than my 40 inch lcd tv (granted, if it was an led tv, my tv consumption would be even less).I checked it from the outside and the light switching is random as if you were watching some intense action flick. At moments its super bright and others its quite dark. I have always used lights on timers and some timers are even a bit more random than just turning on at specific times (anyone remember home alone where the burglars knew the times the lights to deter burglars would go on?).

If I had this unit on a timer, this is the setting I would use.  The other 2 settings are \"dusk+4 hours\" and \"dusk+7 hours\".  The first setting is meant to be used in the summer time when it gets dark later in the day so if it gets dark at 7pm, it will turn off at 11pm approximately.  The other setting is better for winter use where it gets dart at around 5pm which will mean it will turn off at about 12 midnight.  The only bad thing about those 2 settings is that it seems to get confused by lights.  So if you go into the room and turn on the light for an extended period, it seems to reset itself and will then go for darkness+4 hours again based on when you turn off the light.

One important thing, test it first to get the best location for your house.  Also, if you have it set to dusk for four or seven hours, you can't turn a light on in that room or it will think dusk happened later than it really did.  For example, if you turn a light on at midnight, when you turn the light off, it will start again and be on for four or seven hours depending on your setting.

The most important thing is to install this in a room where it CANNOT be seen by anyone peeking into any window or door from outside - preferably on a second floor in the front of the house.  If it's on a first floor, make sure that any nearby \"real TV\" set cannot be seen as being \"off\" while the light show is running.  That would be a dead give-away.  And yes, it is bright enough to see its indirect light reflecting on walls, ceilings, etc.  I live in a rural area with no streetlights, so I'm not sure how it would perform in a bright city environment.

This isn't just a collective of flashing lights, there are pattern algorithms that cycle 12 bright LEDs to make it look exactly like the light output produced by watching TV. The color cycling is extremely realistic when looking at a room from the outside as long as the unit itself can't be seen. Personally I think there's a slight bit too much green instead of blue, but that's just my opinion (how many burglars are that smart, anyway).The light sensor works well, and doesn't turn the unit on until it's pretty dark. Usually won't turn on during light rainy days, for example, if you want to use it with the +4 or +7 hour option and are concerned about it turning off too early.Pair this with a tuner like http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DVZXC0/ and an antenna like http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008ATNW7G/ with some computer speakers like http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R9AAJA/ and you've got a cheap and extremely realistic simulation (an RCA to 1/8\" / 3.5 mm audio adapter is needed for this solution). Of course you need to be in an area that receives TV over the air for this to work, otherwise you would need some more expensive equipment (produce recorded TV or have an active cable network provider and the associated tuner).", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nifty device, works great!", "Author": "ParanoidGeek", "ReviewID": "R36CNXBPTE5DU4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I played around with the FakeTV a couple of times before I set it up to use when we were traveling.

However, since we travel a lot, and we work a lot when we're home, we wanted the extra layer of security for the house (we do have a monitored alarm system, but we don't want to tempt burglars either).We decided that, for the price, we should give it a try.  It is definitely not a cheap item (pricewise) so, if it were to not work properly, we were planning on returning it.Once we received it, it did look and feel cheap (qualitywise) but, then again, it is an LED lamp, and all of those are always light.  The power adapter is definitely a welcomed part of it, since most LED lamps on the market are battery powered and we didn't want to have to worry about batteries.We placed the lamp in an appropriate location (following the guidance from the manual), plugged it in, and waited for sunset.I must say that we were very pleasantly surprised by the outcome.  It does exactly what it says it will do and it does it very well.  We have had friends ask us who was in that room with the TV on (we've kept the secret, so we tell them we have visitors).As long as you follow the guidelines from the manual as to how to properly position the lamp to achieve the desired result, it works perfectly.We are even planning on purchasing a couple more for our parents and siblings.", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product", "Author": "Chucky", "ReviewID": "R2MNKXSY41IUVS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was amazed of the reality that this divece projects, I install de FakeTV in a room on the second floor and went outside from accorss the street, it was as real as if a TV was on.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "great, inexpensive product", "Author": "Ms. Bargain Finder", "ReviewID": "R6TKKFGVCO9HC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "we use this in our bedroom whenever we go away.  neat product!  recommend this to others for nice security when away", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Looks Can Be Deceiving", "Author": "keno", "ReviewID": "R1DN6J03PYDA8L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hard to believe that a little cube can simulate the look of a television 10 times it's size, but it does it with ease.

In the testing process, I did notice that the Fake TV went on late on a gloomy afternoon -- so a dark room might possibly fake the devie into thinking it's evening. Because of that, I'd chose to use the dusk +7hrs option in case it went on earlier than dusk.

Note that it mimics only the light from a t.v., not the sound.  As long as you follow the directions provided (don't have a light on in the same room, don't place it so you can see the device from outside), you really can't tell the difference between a t.v. and this device.  It is light weight, and has about the same lengthy cord as your t.v.  It is entirely easy to use because you just plug it in and set it by clicking on one of four switches.  It turns on with the sun going down automatically, and runs for either 4 hours or 7 hours--- your choice.  I have an exterior light on, and that didn't seem to bother the light sensor at all.  It is very much worth the price. I believe that it likely doesn't use all that much power either, because the lights are led. Don't use it on a timer, it takes care of itself with the automatic light sensor.  I also had a light on a timer in an adjoining room, where the light was not blocked by a wall, and it didn't effect the automatic light sensor either.
