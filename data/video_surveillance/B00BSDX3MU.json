{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great packaging, very hidden and \"reasonable\" performance.", "Author": "Peter Gabriel", "ReviewID": "R3DR9U5GAN7NJE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, the packaging.  The exterior box is just like any alarm clock box.  It's got security (clear circular) adhesive patches where the box opens from.  Only once the box is opened and the \"ip cam software\" disk is seen would someone know what this product truly is.You really can't tell this is an nanny cam.  Unless someone picks it up and unscrews the back little cover (see product photos) and sees the network (RJ-45) jack, would they know.  Even under that cover the WPS button is labelled with something innocuous as is the sd slot.  The only other thing that could give it away is that the power cord is white, most clocks come with black cords.  Also, the power cord is transformer and plugs in (basically looks like an external hard drive power cord).  Lastly, the display on the clock is a little curious.  The time display is BLINDING white.  But, they've covered that too, as there is a display setting with 4 modes, 3 different intensities and \"off.\"  These are minor issues.  A nanny would never look twice at this in the daytime.Now performance.  I've been in software and networking for 15 years, but I am by no means a \"video\" or \"surveillance\" expert.  There are three possible video stream styles for different performance and for each of those, there are 3 real time streaming feeds and three http streams.  And each one can be configured separately.  Users can change, frames per second, video bit rates, audio bit rates, etc.  However, no matter what, I can't seem to get more the 15 fps, no matter what settings I choose.  Also, it comes with the standard, night/moon light/IR settings which can be set to on/off or auto.  All of this is done through an http interface the clock runs.  It's fairly elegant.Here's a note about the night/moon light/IR settings.  There is a audible click when those are changed.  If someone is next to the clock and the settings are changed, the gig is up.  This isn't so much a flaw of the product, I am sure there is some switch in there that has to go on or off for the additional power, it can't be avoided, but it's something to be aware of.  For example, if you have it on \"auto\" and some one comes into the room and turns on the lights, there will be click from the clock and then again when the person turns the lights off.I have also been using \"iSpy\" (freeware) for recording, that's it's own thing but works well with this unit.There is a number for tech support, I never needed to call.  But I would have liked a \"webpage\" somewhere out there for secure4less, where I could look for updated firmware, report bugs, etc.  I am sure that if I called there would be something like that, but the camera has a \"support\" page and it's completely blank.Lastly, cost.  For four hundred and eighty through amozon, it's a little pricey.  If it were one hundred less, it would get 10 stars out 5.  As it is, I had to go with 4.  But is that isn't an issue for you, take the leap and purchase this.", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product, Easy Installation, Surprisingly Great Quality", "Author": "Reviewer25", "ReviewID": "R1EDVV6SFRGRMH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this Camera Clock after doing a search on variety of products offered on the web, and I'm really impressed with the performance so far.Got it today in the mail and installed it really quickly (the company provided a very user friendly installation guide, took me about 5 minutes).The hole for the pinhole camera is basically invisible, and the clock looks like another clock radio on the market.Once I got the product I gave a call to the company and asked a tech question unrelated to this particular product but in the field of video cameras and they helped out - very rare to see a service team help out when it's not their product they're talking about. The tech person was super helpful.", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BSDX3MU"}}
