{"Reviews": [{"Title": "great unit", "Author": "James A. Maloney", "ReviewID": "R2Q5BVFW15IJP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Does great with analog cameras.  Still trying to get a couple non-zmodo ONVIF cameras to work (using latest avail firmware as of 10-15-13).  Works well (very quick) with iphone and ipad, using the zviewer app & vMEye+ app.  Had to strip IE9 of all security to get the web viewing/interface to work, but it is snappy and has never crashed.  Have yet to pull video/audio files off, but was able to with the older model, so I assume it can be done without too much hassle.  Found the zmodo interface software to be much more intuitive.  Also, Typing in ip addresses & passwords (with the mouse) is much easier now.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$689.99", "Features": "Supports Remote Viewing from Smartphone and 3G Mobile Viewing\n2TB Hard Drive Preinstalled\nWeatherproof: Indoor/Outdoor use Cameras\n1/4\" Color CCD Image Sensor\nNight Vision Distance up to 65 feet", "Name": "Zmodo KDK6-NARQZ8ZN-2T 16-Channel Security Surveillance High-Performance DVR System with 8 CCD Bullet Indoor/Outdoor Cameras with 2TB Hard Drive (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NnSLxWEbL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BOL5XI8"}}
