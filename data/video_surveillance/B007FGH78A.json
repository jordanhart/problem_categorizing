With older firmware, it would not work on Macs with quicktime ( the fast high resolution camera modes. )  But with the latest firmware, all is well.  Only issues I have with it are the controls for PTZ are sluggish to respond and buffer your clicks so clicking a lot results in endless panning.  Advanced features like motion detection and movie capture and transfer didn't work when I tried to play with them, but I didn't spend much time with these features as they are not something I was planning on using.  Big plus is better video quality and frame rates - which is the reason I bought it.Overall good camera considering the market and other cameras in this price range.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Image, Great Price", "Author": "John Lindsay", "ReviewID": "REYPAL2VE3UKZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is fantastic. I have two - one for my main floor in my house, and another in my garage. The night image is unbelievable - very clear, and very bright. As long as you do not have any kind of reflective surface near the IR LEDs at night (like a close wall or window) the image will be great.The app for the phone works very well too - I just wish they would allow the \"presets\" in there as well, as panning and tilting over 3G can get a little slow.", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Indoor Camera", "Author": "Frank1040", "ReviewID": "R29OZVVQDA4U5H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Works well and is easy to set up on home wi fi network.

If it were not for the setup and lack of instructions to get you through the more difficult parts like configuring your home router to send the proper ports back the correct IP, etc. I would have given it 5 stars. I am a network engineer so it was not difficult for me, but others may have to do some research, to access it from outside your home network.Great quality of image, and love the camera. It even recovered from a power hit, that jumbled the image until we could power cycle it. Works great on LAN and WLAN. This is the one WITHOUT the IR LEDs. My wife uses it to look out our window at the bird feeders remotely, so at night the IR LEDs would just reflect off the widows, so we are happier with this model.", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera works well", "Author": "Frederick W.

Pearce", "ReviewID": "R3TK7GVUPQRDAF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "[Pan/Tilt]- Terrible Pan/Tilt controls in web interface.  You can move the camera a tiny bit at a time in 8 directions, or send it to the home position.  No preset positions in the web interface except \"Home\".  At the very least they should have supported keyboard input.+ Higher than average Pan/Tilt speed.  Useful if you have good compatible 3rd party software.* I didn't try the included offical PC software, which might be better (I doubt it, though!).* I reverse engineered how the pan/tilt commands are sent. The camera can accept commands to move MUCH farther than the web interface exposes.  Surely there is some 3rd party software out there that can take advantage of this and take some of the pain out of moving the camera.[Image Quality]+ 1280x800 resolution at 30 frames per second (H.264 encoding).  This is slightly taller than 720p video.+ Low latency video (which is crucial for Pan/Tilt cameras).+ Automatic and/or manual day/night mode with built-in Infrared emitters.+ Supports configurable-resolution jpeg captures (~5 frames per second at native resolution).  Great for compatibility with simpler or older programs and for publishing to web sites.[Zoom]- What zoom?  All zoom is digital zoom, which your browser can do better anyway using its own zoom controls.[Audio]+ It has a built-in microphone.+ It has a line-out jack so speakers can be plugged in (untested)[Other Notes]I did not try the built-in motion detection.", "Date": "April 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent for the price", "Author": "S.

So far I've had a ticket in for over a month asking why Macs can not view either MPEG4 or H.264, just the seriously lousy JPEG. I was given a quick \"Use Firefox, it won't work in Safari\" answer (which of course was bull), and when I kept up the inquiries they said they would look into it with the Mac in their office... which as of this writing was 2 weeks ago. It requires Java, but also must install an additional Trendnet-specific plug-in to work at all. Quality of the camera itself is very good. No way to allow casual guest access without a user/password. Has trouble saving settings on occasion. Loses wireless connectivity easily, just for the heck of it.I spent a lot of money on this camera, and to me it's useless. Nowhere, and I mean NOWHERE does their site or documentation say anything like \"WILL NOT WORK FULLY ON A MAC\".

In other words NO useless and a bad implementation of DDNS.- I had to factory reset the camera several times because when I make a change to any of the parameters the same, the camera simply records but the change does not work, try changing eg the mail recipient and even taking change, not the email sent to the new set.The image is decent if inside a house, but if you place it inside a porch overlooking your yard, too much light makes the image of false colors and image quality is lost in general .After I bought 3 cameras brand Airlive WN-200HD and I are but far better than this, everything works correctly, are completely stable, no crashes, DDNS is always updated, etc..The only good thing and so has a star, is that the manufacturer answer me and I agree that the camera is bad and accept change by warranty, so far I have not sent but soon I will.", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$299.99", "Features": "See more with Megapixel resolution up to 1280 x 800 (WXGA)\nPan 340 degree side-to-side and tilt 115 degree up-and-down\nHigh speed wireless connection\nProgram motion detection recording;recording schedules;email alerts and more with complimentary software\n2-way audio", "Name": "TRENDnet Megapixel Wireless N Pan, Tilt, Zoom Network Surveillance Camera with 2-Way Audio, TV-IP672W (White)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ESieEMHFL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007FGH78A"}}
