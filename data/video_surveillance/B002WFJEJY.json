{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A little disappointed", "Author": "Product Tester", "ReviewID": "R201DIRRZVGIWK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The sticker is about the size of a dollar coin; therefore, the writing is very difficult to see. Since this is a surveillance system decal it should be visible to see from at least 5 feet or so. The shipping cost is also on the high end since they charge $4.00 to do so when it actually costs 44 cents (first class mail envelope). Overall, I would not recommend this product from this seller at all.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Appears Sturdy and Durable", "Author": "E. Fisher", "ReviewID": "R8VZQOEBKMW8Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These stickers appear sturdy and durable.  They are reasonably thick and the ink is on pretty thick so they may last.  I put one on the glass block windows next to my front door a couple of months ago and it still looks new.  No pealing around the edges so far.Maybe in a couple of years I could update this review with information on how the sticker wears, but seriously, how much time can one spend reviewing stickers?  :-)", "Date": "November 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for home security systems", "Author": "Item Seller", "ReviewID": "R1ZLKYC4791T31", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Most of the surveillance stickers I found were large and would dominate the window.

They appear hardy, but I wish they attached on inside of glass as opposed to on top of it, outside. So far no fading, other than a metal or plastic sign, these are as good as it gets,  I would buy again from this company, of course just wish they were less costly, only reason for 4 and not 5 stars.", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "great stickers", "Author": "Design Diva \"Design Diva\"", "ReviewID": "R3A3YKTSIGSS3O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We used these stickers in addition to the matching sign after a theft in our driveway.  Although the theft was caught by our cameras, I think if we had these to begin with, it would have deterred the kids from coming into our yard.  I placed this on the mail box in the street and have been surprised how many neighbors noticed it. I also placed them in other locations around the outside of the house.  They are nice quality and have endured the elements. The color has not faded and they have not peeled back or bubbled.
