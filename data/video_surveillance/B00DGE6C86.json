{"Reviews": [{"Title": "\"Set and Forget\" Security Solution Requires Some Set Up", "Author": "Lisa M. Hendey \"Mom, Blogger, Podcaster, Author\"", "ReviewID": "R3CP5U62MCH30", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received the SwannSWDVK-825554-US 8-Channel DVR and 4 x 540 TVL Cameras (Black) system as a part of the Amazon Vine program. Overall, the system is very high quality and seems well manufactured. The packaging is sound and the instruction manual that comes with the product is clear and comprehensive.The system offers many options which can be used according to the needs of your home or business. Some of these options include:* 1-8 cameras* High or low definition* Ability to view one, all or selected cameras on an external monitor (monitor not included)* System can be hooked to the DVR or to the Internet on enabled devices such as smartphones and tablets* System comes with softwareA few comments on the positive aspects of the system:* The night vision is excellent and the system switches automatically from color to black and white for night/low light conditions* The system affords the option for audio recording, but the cameras we received for review did not include this option* The system can be hooked to an external drive for extra memory if needed* The system comes with information for arranging professional installationThe only downside that seemed evident in reviewing this security system is that it requires wired connections, making installation much more difficult than if the system used wireless cameras. It would be much easier and more flexible to configure if the cameras could connect directly to the DVR or your computer wirelessly. This \"wired\" factor should be a consideration when you are deciding where to locate the cameras.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great but could be a little better.", "Author": "Bone \"JLLaser-net\"", "ReviewID": "R3VSF6NBH4X26P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've got to say this is one of the better systems that I've come across to date but for the price it really should have had mics in the cameras...The menus are quite nice though and there are so many different ways to configure the cameras to record only when there is motion at certain times or normal recording for other hours and even black out certain hours when say the store is closed and there is no need to have all the cameras on.I've been using it for a few weeks now and it's been rather nice and a great addition to security system. Another thing is the remote viewing is quite nice as well.It came with a 500GB drive installed, there was no need to do anything other than plug it in and start going through the menus. It will take some time to setup the different hours to record and learn all the different functions of each menu but the included mouse does make moving around the menus a lot easier. The cameras can even be renames as to their locations in the building.The night vision works rather well but is a little limited for outdoor use but that can be easily fixed by just getting a couple better longer range cameras meant for larger outdoor areas.This unit only allows for 16:9 video which is a little better than standard video quality (standard is 480p) which is actually pretty good compared to most other systems as the frame rate is higher (can be adjusted to be a slower frame rate to save space on the hard drive).One thing I would certainly suggest is to set it up to only erase the hard drive once it is full. If you have it erase as it goes it will cause a lot more wear on the hard drive and it will fail a lot sooner. I've had this issue with other systems so keep that in mind with this one. With 4 cameras and lowering the frame rate I was able to record for about just shy of 3 weeks.I was quite surprised though as the quality from the system but also it should have had some better features for it's price. Overall it's quite a good system and anyone should be happy with it and you will certainly get some rather nice video quality you just don't get audio with the included cameras. That can be added though with different cameras.Could make for some rather interesting videos for some amateur movie making also... security system feeds for stuff and it does let you export video files as well to make things easy. You can even select from different times and tell it exactly what you want to export to a flash drive.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice home system with easy setup", "Author": "Water Monkey \"Marc B.\"", "ReviewID": "R248CXXAQZU4EV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like this Swann security system.  I have found it was easy to set up and get running.  We are using it as perimeter security around our house and it does all we wanted and more (with it's Internet capabilities).  Not only has the system provided the needed recorded security we wanted, but it has become useful in other situations. Depending on how you aim the cameras you can monitor deliveries and/or monitor pets in real time (with the free phone app).  The key to all this is the camera placement.While set up is simple, we had to carefully consider camera placement in order to deliver the feeds we wanted.  Make sure you place the cameras in a protected location (like under the eaves). Make sure that nothing will obscure the view. Consider redundant camera angles (multiple cameras focused on the same location from different angles). Also, consider if you want to conceal the cameras so no one knows they are being monitored.For us, the biggest concern was wiring.  It is nice that Swann provides ample cable for your cameras.  A single wire will provide both power and video connection.  Each camera has two jacks (power and video), it is simple once you see it.  We did not want the wiring for the system to be visible (mostly for aesthetics). This meant drilling into the walls and running the cable through the attic, this is something to consider when installing. It took a few hours to set it up the way we wanted in order to give us the video feeds we wanted.I really like the system and I love the fact that I can expand the system to 8 cameras simply by buying the new cameras and plugging them in.  Replacing a damaged camera will also be a breeze.I would recommend this system to anyone who is looking for this level of security.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice option for home owners or small businesses...", "Author": "Angela W. \"bookangel\"", "ReviewID": "R3R2EV5YIAVY3L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this because we run a small business out of our home and would like to have more security.  My husband and I set it up ourselves, and we have about average technical ability, haha.  We noticed that the users manual is VERY user friendly - it has written instructions as well as great pictures and charts if you are a visual person - and they automatically include a spanish manual too.It took us a few hours to set up, with our average technical ability.  It was tedious at times.  If you prefer there is a card included giving you a phone number and information to pay for a professional to install it for you - it's your choice.We think the 500 gb hard drive is very nice because of vacations - there is enough space on that hard drive to record for 15 days straight, or longer if you use the motion detection method.The HDMI cable plugs into the computer monitor or TV for viewing.  The other cable plugs into your internet router.There are 4 cameras included and each of them needs to be plugged into an electric outlet, as does the main unit.Each camera comes with a nice length of wire - I didn't get the exact length but thought it was a generous amount.There is no USB cable included, but if you want to get a USB cable you can use it to connect and backup to your computer.  Or you can also use a large flash drive.We have it set up to record video only but it seems like there would be a way to set it up to record audio as well although it would require additional purchases.We've only had it a couple weeks and fortunately there have been no prowlers or break ins but we are pleased with it and glad to have it.  We would recommend it for other small business owners or home owners.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Professional quality", "Author": "Miss Kitty \"Timid Observer\"", "ReviewID": "R30TIGQ391QIL3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The  SwannSWDVK-825554-US 8-Channel DVR and 4 x 540 TVL Camera is the affordable security solution.
