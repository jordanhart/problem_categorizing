If you login into the camera's software, there is a box to click for \"Outdoors\" and it works perfectly.  The sun will white wash out the picture if this box is NOT clicked.Does not have night vision, but works well with just the porch light on.  The software that comes with it is just okay.  I use ispy connect which is completely free and has lots of features.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Work Fine", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3JH6JQ9IBUZNQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "They work fine and the price is right. I have two of these and they work with an Android app remotely - setup is a little tricky if you don't read instructions - but if you do read the instructions carefully it's easy.", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Met my expectations", "Author": "Norm Hansen", "ReviewID": "RSAX4VOH4SKGQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had a little trouble getting the Wi-Fi set up, but Rosewill provided good support to get it figured out.  I am pleased with the camera and it works as expected.  The included software enables recording onto your PC to serve as a security camera if desired. One thing to note is that it is set for indoor lighting levels.  I intended to use it to view outdoors through a window, but sunlight is too bright and it washes out the picture.  Changing the brightness settings did not help, but putting a tinted lense in front did.  Good camera for the money.", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not bad, but not great, either.", "Author": "Michael Livote \"dragon2knight\"", "ReviewID": "RR30W3S4L07WC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this to monitor my hallway in an apartment building for extra security(I don't live in the greatest neighborhood).  It's is sitting quite a ways from my router, and the signal has to penetrate a total of three walls in the process. The pic returned to my computer is decent, clear and with a wide enough angle to allow me to see whats going on outside my door pretty well.Getting that signal requires a bit of knowledge about router settings and how to access them, though, so keep that in mind when buying this. All of these IP cameras require you have some experience with that, not just this one, so I'm not going to hold anything against this for that. The included software is basic at best, but it does allow you to capture and record video with little fuss, so at least it's good enough for what I bought it for.The only real problem I'm seeing is the signal does drop a lot, causing a lot of skipping in my recordings, it does reset itself each time it does this, so at least it's still usable. All told, for the price, I got exactly what I paid for, nothing more, nothing less, and that makes me recommend this one.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00A15H4IA"}}
