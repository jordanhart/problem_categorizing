{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great picture quality and works on my Apple iPhone!", "Author": "E. Kim", "ReviewID": "R4T209RYKFYNT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a \"nanny cam\" to monitor a new nanny, but felt a little uncomfortable about having one of the hidden ones.  I felt that having a visible camera known to the nanny was a more respectful approach, although I would need several of them to monitor multiple areas since the locations would be known (and could potentially be avoided).The Panasonic BL-C230A seemed like a great choice as it is from a major international brand and the reviews of its other wired and wireless cameras indicated that they were well received.PROS1. It's cute - It could star as a character in a Japanese cartoon.  The nanny cam is a cube about 3\" x 3\" x 3 1/4\" (approximately) and actually looks cute with its single eye and single antenna that looks like an ear.  It has a high quality look to it with its high gloss white finish and reminds me of a smaller version of an old Sony Dream Machine alarm clock.  It actually looks like it belongs on a nightstand in the bedroom or in a kitchen.  It does not look out of place in a home and does not have a \"tech\" feel to it.  I think this is a major plus as I really don't want the nanny to feel like I'm trying to determine if she is a terrorist.2. Uses Wi-Fi 802.11 b only, g only, b/g both3. Free lifetime use of Panasonic's \"dynamic DNS server\" - (more on this later)4. Easy setup (maybe) - Easy to use paper instructions limited to 3 sheets of paper (of which only 2 are necessary).  Sheet 1 shows step-by-step instruction on how to plug the camera into your router with a cable (not supplied and necessary even for wireless in the setup phase) and to connect the power cable.  Sheet 2 is the sheet on how to configure the camera using your computer.  This is the part that has the potential to be alarming or at least uncomfortable if you're not lucky enough to have UPnP (universal plug and play) on your router.  (More on this later.)5. Great interface with web browsers - Once your device is set up for internet access (more on this later) it has a fairly intuitive interface using Internet Explorer with an Active X control (and also on my Apple Safari although I used my PC with Vista for the camera setup with my Apple Mac for the router changes).  There is a viewing screen that allows for 3 resolutions (192x144, 320x240, 640x480).  There is a graphical control on the left of the viewing screen with arrows up/down and left/right for tilt and pans.  What's nice is there is an auto tilt and auto pan button that will cause the camera to sweep back and forth quickly to give a quick overview of the room.  Clicking on a part of the viewing screen will redirect the camera to focus on that spot.  There is also multi-camera support for what appears to be up to 16 separate cameras.6. Fantastic image quality!  (It is definitely grainy in low-light, but that's to be expected.)7. Infrared body heat detection system - does not work if using only browsers but works well using the optional record software install8. Sound detection - Camera can be set to record not just with body movement triggers but sound triggers.9. Zoom ability - Only with the optional recording software installed.  Does not zoom using browsers only.10. Audio - (Not on iPhone browser or Google Chrome, however)11. Mountable - Comes with mounting screws and a safety wire in case it falls from your wall12. Seems to be Apple compatible (except the initial setup and for video recording which appears to require installation of software different from using just a web browser, although I have not yet tested the video recording feature yet) - Works on my Apple Safari web browser as well as Internet Explorer (with Active X).The system requirements written on the outside of the Panasonic box seem to indicate only Windows XP SP2 and Vista with Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8 are compatible, but this may be true only for the additional software to set up video recording and the initial camera setup. The browsers seem adequate so far for just watching streaming video and taking still photos as well as maneuvering the camera. I cannot get sound, however, using my Apple iPhone Safari browser or Google Chrome on my PC.  Sounds works well on Internet Explorer with Active-X.CONS1. Setting the camera up for internet access outside of your home can either be very easy or can be scary for technophobes.  Your router must support something called UPnP, Universal Plug and Play for this to work smoothly (I imagine).  When I say smoothly, I mean, being able to follow the step-by-step instruction on sheet #2.  If you do NOT have a router that supports UPnP then the step-by-step instructions basically tell you to go to the manual on the CD which gives a great introduction on private IP addresses, WAN addresses, static IP addresses, and the usefulness of something called a \"dynamic DNS server\".If you are now thinking that you will be over your head by all of this jargon, realize that most routers support UPnP and thus you can follow the step-by-step instructions which use an \"automatic\" mode in the configuration steps using your web browser.  I am using an Apple Airport Base Extreme which does NOT support UPnP.  My experience was that it required about 10 extra minutes for me to figure out that I needed to set up something like \"port mapping\" for my Apple router.2. Although this is a \"wireless\" network camera, the description is slightly deceptive.  It is wireless only in the networking sense.  I should have thought about this more carefully, because what I really expected was a \"cordless\" camera.  This camera has a powercord attached to it, although is \"wireless\".3. It seems that there are 2 versions of video recording software that is an optional install. Oddly, the one for single camera support versus multiple (16) camera support are compatible with different Windows versions.4. I have installed the optional software to my Windows Vista PC to support up to 16 cameras and found that the software works well and is intuitive to use for motion-detection recording.  The software appears to be fine for my uses, but you have to pay for a retail version of the software if you want expanded features such as the ability to export their video data files to JPEG or MPEG format, or if you want to use their video backup feature.  (I have separate third party software that mirrors my internal hard drives to external drives, so the lack of a built-in video backup feature is not critical to me.)  I have not yet tried to see if this optional recording software will work with Bootcamp or VMWare on my Apple Macbook Pro.TIPSFor those of you who also use an Apple Airport Base Extreme (which does not support UPnP), here's what I had to do:A. Launch \"Airport Utility\" software from my Mac then select \"Manual Setup\"B. Select \"Advanced\" from the top tabC. Select \"Port Mapping\" from a sub-tabD. Click on the \"+\" to add a device to this mapping so that an outside computer can access my device and is thus \"mapped\"E. In the drop-down menu select \"Personal Web Sharing\"F. Make sure the \"public\" and \"private TCP\" ports have the same number such as \"80\" in the text fields (which they do by default if you selected \"Personal Web Sharing\"G. Save and update the modem (requires restart)H. Go to the installation CD for the Camera and using Internet Explorer to configure the camera, choose \"Setup\" from the top in the web pageI. Select \"Static\" and NOT \"Automatic Setup\" and type in a number such as \"80\" into the \"Port No.\" field, and saveJ. Go to the \"Internet\" tab of the web pageK. Select \"Disable\" from the \"Auto Port Forwarding (IPv4) option.  This is DIFFERENT from the step-by-step instructions given which only work for those who have UPnP.L. Select \"Register with ...........com\"M. Select \"Save\"N. You will then be directed to the \"..............com\" website which is Panasonic's \"Dynamic DNS server\" which basically will allow your router if it does not support UPnP to work.  This website is also how you will be able to view your camera using a web browser outside of your home and local network.CONCLUSIONI am impressed enough to have ordered two additional \"wireless\" cameras.  Its ease of use with the iPhone's standard web browser is simply awesome.  My colleagues at work were so impressed by it that they have also placed orders for the device within hours of them seeing for themselves the streaming video on my iPhone and on my desktop at work.I also suspect that my nanny will not feel like I'm some crazy overly zealous parent either, but that I just want a logical way to check up on the kids.  It is a non-intimidating appearing piece of houseware that just seems fun and entertaining while being a legitimate surveillance camera.I hope this review was of some help!", "Date": "February 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Replaces the BL-C131, but not everything improved", "Author": "George Robbins", "ReviewID": "R35H8MO9VRU3JL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my eighth Panasonic camera of this type.  I started with the BL-C30, then the BL-C131a, and now this BL-C230a.  Some things have been improved, others have not:Improvements:  - Clear cover over rotating lens assembly should help keep dust and dirt off lens and out of internal gears.  - Audio alarm options (although my last C-131 had a similar capability).  - External connection for NC or NO relays.  - The buffer memory has been increased substantially. The camera can store 3 to 4 times as many still shots before filling memory and/or overwriting the earliest captured images.Disappointments:  - Tripod threads were non-existant on my BL-C230a.  The insert where the threads were supposed to be was a plastic insert (similar to my last C-131 - the earlier C-131s had a tapped metal insert), but the threads were not cut into the plastic insert.  I tried using various bolts and self tapping screws to no avail. Don't know if this is a defect in the C-230a I received, or is representative of the majority coming off the assembly line.  - Night vision in low light is much worse than the C-131.  Even with the option set for color low light, the picture is terribly grainy when compared to my last C-131 sitting side by side under the same lighting conditions.In general the 230 is similar to the 131.  Setup and connectivity are the same, the daylight images are good.  The 230 now offers H.264 video, but I don't see that as a major draw.  For my viewing I use predominantly JPEG and rarely JPEG4. The focal length of the lens has been changed - it provides a wider angle view.  Also the panning and tilting limits are reduced, but coupled with the wider angle view, the total pan and tilt viewing limits are the same as the C-131 - at least as cited in the specification.  In reality, the total pan viewing range (left to right limits) is slightly less than the C-131. I'm not too thrilled about this.I do use my cameras for low light and night time monitoring, and the quality of the low light images of the 230 is much worse than its predecessors. By low light I mean viewing an outdoor scene illuminated by flood lights.  In reality, it's a well lit area.  The C-131 provided pretty good video and captured still images well, and I was expecting the same from the C-230.  I was sorely disappointed to see the very grainy images.  I hope Panasonic will improve this aspect of the camera.", "Date": "June 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great replacement for the BL-C131A", "Author": "scoosdad", "ReviewID": "R3EU03GC7B2CH6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Last year I purchased the BL-C131A camera that has similar attributes to this model. When I went to buy a second camera, it had been discontinued and replaced with this new model.For anyone like me who's considering purchasing a second camera, don't hesitate to pick this one up.  It sets up almost exactly like the previous model, comes with the same DDNS service so you can easily monitor and control it from afar, and if anything the picture quality has improved greatly, something I didn't think would have been possible given the excellent quality of the BL-C131A.A couple of physical differences to be aware of, and also something that is left off the documentation:  if you're using a tripod or tripod screw on your present camera, you know there are holes for that in the back and on the bottom.  On this model, the tripod threads are only on the back, so if you are planning on putting it on some kind of tripod threaded device, keep that in mind.This camera comes with a clear plastic cover over the front of it that looks like it was put there for shipping and might be designed to be removed in use.  No, it's a permanent part of the front of the camera and keeps dust and other hazards in your house from messing up the front of the camera.  Don't try to pry it off, it's meant to stay put and it doesn't impact the image quality one bit.The wireless setup is the same as in the BL-C131A but they forgot to mention one thing in the documentation that was required of the BL-C131A and left me wondering if it was needed here-- if you use MAC address filtering on the wireless of your router to limit access to your network that way, you need to not only list the MAC address of the camera so that it can gain access to your network, you also need to add a second MAC address to the \"admit\" list that is one digit higher than that of the camera.  So if your camera's MAC ends in \"CC\", you need to also admit the same MAC again but with \"CD\" at the end of the second address.  It's a minor fluke in this camera that they did mention for the previous model, but neglected to say anything about with this model.  I set it up without the second MAC, and it didn't work. Added the second MAC, and everything started working perfectly.  And don't forget like I did on this one-- you'll need to specify a different port to forward on your router than you set up for the first camera.  I did set up the different port number on the camera itself, then forgot to tell my router to forward that port from the outside.  Once I did that, I had instant access to it from outside the house via the Panasonic DDNS service (you need to register a new unique URL for this camera just like you did for the first).I'm currently also using a Total Control software app on my Blackberry to see both of my cameras while on the go, and that works great.The other feature that may be of interest to some do-it-yourselfers is that the camera has switch closure output terminals on it that can be triggered from the web control panel (as well as a remotely controlled buzzer in the camera that I haven't figured out a use for yet).  So if you're handy and can wire those switch contacts to an external relay or device, you could turn things in your house on and off remotely.  I have an electrically operated pet door that leads out to my (fenced) back yard which I'm considering interfacing to the camera, so I can decide if I want to let my pets in and out when I'm not home.  All I need to do is install the camera with a good view through the pet door (it's clear plexiglas), wire the camera's trigger up to the door's switch, and I'm good to go.  You can also use the trigger to unlock an electrically operated door latch in the entryway to a secure office, for example.  There are also additional external sensor input terminals on the back for things like door switches and motion sensors that you might want to place in a location not covered by the camera's own internal sensors and use the camera's email feature to alert you when something happens.Finally, even if you think you won't use the included camera recording software on the CD provided, install it anyway.  Its monitoring feature, allowing you to see all cameras in your network on one screen, and to click to select one of them to be viewed as large as you like, is much much better than opening up multiple browser windows on your desktop to accomplish the same task, or using the \"Multiple\" tab on the browser app.  It's an evaluation copy for the full version that lists for $399, so its recording features are pretty limited (no export allowed to standard JPEG or MPEG formats, for example).  But install it anyway to have a one-stop place to see all of your cameras by opening one application.  I also installed it on a PC that is off my network, and after inputting your standard DDNS URL's in its setup and storing your usual login information, it provides the same monitoring function on a remote machine, same as you'd get inside your network, and the login process is now automatic.", "Date": "February 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "nice camera but lousy documentation makes setup a pain", "Author": "Erika \"Erika\"", "ReviewID": "R20X68TQ1YOLVU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Once I had the camera up and running I was pleasantly surprised by all its features and functionality. It took me 3 days though to get it up and running (I'm just your average computer savvy user). I had it running in wired mode within 15 minutes by following the instructions. Getting wireless to work, make it accessible over the Internet and setting email notifications up was painful though. The explanations, documentations and screen notes added by Panasonic to the camera software are clearly designed to drive anyone nuts. After I finally figured it all out I realized that it could have been very easy. Panasonic should just have provided decent documentation on how to set it up manually - instead of relying on the \"Plug & Play\" functionality of routers (aka UPnP). Others here have done a good job reviewing the camera features so I'm just going to add some notes on the setup that I hope might be helpful to other \"not so technical users\" like me.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Setup Notes:The automatic setup worked until I got to the part  for wireless and Internet access (to be able to connect to the camera from outside via Internet). If you have the same trouble I would suggest making first sure that all the following settings are correct even if you THINK you entered them correctly (no typos etc.).***********************a) Most important: Network settings (all kind of problems derive from having these wrong).Go to > Setup Tab > Network(IPv4) > Connection Mode > Static > open the link and check the network settings. If your connection mode is set to Automatic then first restart the camera (Maintenance tab/Restart). Once it's up again put the Startup CD back in > start the setup program > search for the camera > select the camera > press \"network settings\" > check \"specify an IP address\".The following settings have to be filled in correctly here: 1) IPv4 address (this is the IP address of your camera on your local network and should have already been filled during the automatic setup (e.g. 192.168.0.253)), 2) Port Number is 80 by default.  80 is fine if you don't have any other device on your home network that you want to access from outside. I changed the port number to 8001 to avoid conflicts.3) Default Gateway & DNS server 1 should both be filled with your router's local IP address (e.g. 192.168.0.1).  That's the number that you use to access the settings of the router (e.g. by putting[...] into your Internet browser.3) Subnet mask is usually 255.255.255.04) I filled DNS server 2 with 4.2.2.1 following a screen shot that I found on the Internet. Honestly: I have no idea why but it seems to work.*************************b)  Set up port forwarding on your router. Usually you log into your router by typing the local IP address of the router into your Internet Browser  (e.g. by putting [...] into your Internet browser.)Somewhere on your router should be a setup form for port forwarding. It might be called differently though (e.g. Virtual Server, Address transalation).Setting up port forwarding only means that you map the port that you've chosen (8001 in my case) to the local IP address of your camera (192.168.0.253). For protocols choose \"both\" if there is a setting like that. Port forwarding will allow you to access the camera from the Internet.***********************************c) Go to > Setup > Dynamic DNS and register with [...](don't use the Internet tab). If the account link under \"account\" does not get filled then that means that your network settings are not correct (see point a, ignore the notes in red on the top of the screen, they refer to the online registration form that you haven't opened yet). If the account link gets filled then you have to click on the link to get to the [...] website and register. Once you're finished you can find the new Internet address for your camera on the Maintenance > Status tab. That address might not work if you are connected to the Internet through the same local network as your camera (ask someone else to test).***********************************d) Check your wireless settings (tab setup > wireless). After checking the wireless settings I noticed that the SSID said \"Netcam\" instead of having the name of my home network. I'm pretty sure I never entered that.***********************************e) Try restarting the camera after you made changes if it still doesn't work.***********************************f) Email notifications: that might only work if you use the email and the mail server that your ISP gave you (for the outgoing mail). I have Comcast cable Internet so I'm using [...] as server and my Comcast email account as login. If you want to get SMS text notifications then you have to find out what your phone email address is. It's your phone number followed by a specific domain that your cell phone service provider supplies. E.g. I have T-Mobile and so it's my cell phone number followed by [...].************************************The Panasonic customer support number is difficult to find on their website. It's 1-800-211-PANA (7262).I found these websites more helpful than the Panasonic website: [...][...][...]", "Date": "June 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great pan/tilt network camera - excellent image quality", "Author": "BuyerOfThings", "ReviewID": "R2CJ0MBF7LFQ1K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned various network cameras over the years, from Axis, D-Link, and Linksys.  This Panasonic camera is by far the best one I've used to date because of its excellent image quality and good pan tilt feature, all at a pretty reasonable price for what you are getting.  The camera itself is very compact, it's about 3x3x3, and the white cube design makes it reasonably attractive (in other words, it won't stick out like a sore thumb).  Images and video are all very good in daylight conditions.  Compared to the cameras I've had in the past, the Panasonic images are incredibly sharp and clear (with no manual lens focusing required).  The video streams smoothly across my 802.11g network.  Low light video, on the other hand, is not that great.  This is a great daytime camera, it's not for you if you want to do nighttime monitoring, such as in a nursery with a night light (which I am not).  The camera also streams audio, and this feature works very well.  Audio comes across smoothly and clearly.  The audio feature is one-way (listen only), however you can trigger the camera to sound an alarm if you want to get someone's attention on the other end.  Pan-tilt feature tops off this camera's feature set.  It's not 360 degree pan/tilt, but this camera also doesn't cost $1000+.  You can get about 90 degrees panning left to rigiht, and about 40 degrees vertical tilt.  The 90 degree pan is sufficient to cover a normal room, just place the camera in a corner and you'll be able to see most everything in the room.  The movements are pretty responsive, there's maybe a 1 second lag between issuing the command and seeing movement.  The pan/tilt camera movement is pretty quiet, but not 100% silent; you can hear the lens moving when it is dead silent, but otherwise it's not that noticeable.  The zoom feature on this camera is digital and not optical, so basically there is no zoom (which is pretty standard for this price range).  Setup was very easy and straight forward connecting to a Linksys WRT320N - no problems out of the box.  Just follow the instructions.  The wireless range from camera to router seems to be about the same as from my notebook to router.  As with all network cameras, users view the live image or video by connecting to the camera's internal web server through any standard web browser.  The Panasonic web interface allows you to view a single camera, or multiple Panasonic cameras at the same time.  If motion detection is something you are interested in, you'll be happy to know that the camera's built-in web interface captures and will send still images or a notification message to your e-mail when movement is detected.  It also records a few minutes of the most recent movement activity detected.  The motion detection works very well and is reliable.  I have not looked at the software on the CD that ships with the camera, but reviewer Scoosdad has helpfully commented that it ships with video recording software that is functional (see comments section).  Overall, I am very happy with this pan/tilt network camera.  There are other pan/tilt network cameras that cost less than the Panasonic, but network cameras are really one of those things where \"you get what you pay for\".  Great job Panasonic!PS: The number of shills on both sides (positive and negative) for this particular product is getting pretty ridiculous.  Read through all the reviews and comments, it's not too hard to pick out who the paid reviewers are.  For example, there's the non-native English speaking guy who makes the same spelling and grammatical mistakes in every review using his twenty accounts.  I won't name names, it's pretty easy to figure out who it is.  And then there are the pro-Panasonic guys who are maybe a little *too* into this camera.

The router through which it would send images is a Belkin wireless 802.11g that's a few years old, connected to a cable modem.  The home hardware is currently Mac Pro, and this product must be configured using a Windows machine, although it's claimed that once it's configured it should not matter which web browser is used to view images.  Fortunately I had an old Windows computer available to do the one-time configuration.I was able to get the Windows software running, which showed the camera images when the camera was direct-wired to one of the router's ports (that is, using ethernet cable).  I was also able to tilt and pan the camera in this mode.  However, once the camera was moved one floor down, no wireless signal could be received.  This in spite of the fact that a Macbook and iTouch both get a strong signal in the same room, indeed everywhere in the house.The camera was then re-connected with ethernet cable to the router, and I proceeded to follow directions to make the camera internet accessible.  This process failed on two attempts.  Neither Safari, nor Firefox, nor IE made any difference.  Not only did the camera and/or configuration fail to perform, the process of making it internet accessible left changes in the router's firmware that \"broke\" it.  The router had to be reset to factory settings and laboriously re-programmed with its encryption password and the allowed MAC addresses.Panasonic's installation and user documentation is a pathetic four pages, only two of which will be relevant for 99% of users.  This, for a highly complex device that can fail to work in so many ways.  I did not expect it to be automatic or idiot-proof, but with a Ph.D. in computer science (and I'm not kidding here) I should have been able to get this working.

I purchased the unit as new, but technical support tells me that the unit had been previously registered to a previous owner, which I can verify from the setup screen - apparently it was a returned unit resold as new!!

It runs day and night, capturing time lapse and motion and is always accessible and responsive both from inside my home network (based on an Airport Extreme N) and outside my network via port forwarding.So, I thought it would be nice to have a couple of additional cameras as I like being able to check on my cats and so I bought two of this newer model, BL-C230.  Good grief, so much grief! They were a hassle to set up even using a Windows environment and the native software.  It took a great deal of fussing and troubleshooting but I finally got them working.... for minutes at a time.  Yeah, no kidding.  They do sometimes seem to stay up and running for hours or even a few days, but they're incredibly unreliable.  You check back and find that one or the other of them have gone off-line again showing an amber light rather than green and being completely unresponsive to web access.  I can power them down and get them up and running again but it doesn't last long.I've tried them both in wireless and wired mode.  It seems like the trouble is in wireless mode, as they seem to keep working in wired mode.  Meanwhile, the BL-C131A just keeps on humming just fine in wireless mode.  I've upgraded these two new ones to the newest firmware but they're still not any more reliable.  Next up I'll see if Panasonic tech support can help but from the sound of reviews from other owners, there seems to be one or more serious flaws in these camera's firmware.UPDATE: Tried some suggestions from Panasonic tech support which did have an effect but ultimately both cameras continued to go unresponsive at times.  However, some time later I received and applied a new firmware update for my WiFi router (an AirPort Extreme) and... lo and behold, these two cameras stopped misbehaving completely!  So apparently there's something finicky about the new model's WiFi support since I never had trouble with the older model.  Anyway, at least it's all working now.  Beware that setup can be a bit of a hassle and this model may have trouble with your WiFi network where other devices, including the older model did not.Also, note that the audio support still relies on ActiveX which means it's not available for many devices/platforms.", "Date": "August 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Panasonic network cams keep getting better and better", "Author": "J. Phillips", "ReviewID": "RLS953UZTGI10", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my fourth Panasonic IP/network camera.  They have progressively improved with each generation; I'm really impressed with the improvements.  All of these camera work flawlessly if you configure them in your home network correctly.  It does take a bit of IT know-how to get everything from these cameras that they are capable of.I started with the Panasonic's first generation and got a BL-C1A and BL-C20A. These allowed me to see what was going on at my house while I was away, notify me if motion detection was triggered, view the cameras from outside my house and also send captured images off-site to other computers/servers.  When viewing the camera remotely, the Panasonic web server software only refreshed the image every three seconds; it did not have streaming MPEG functionality. The fixed CMOS sensors in this first generation have very good low-light ability; but the image quality overall is average (but sufficient).I then purchased a second-generation BL-C131A. This camera has the same CMOS sensor as the BL-C1A and BL-C20A but it is now pan-and-scan.  That is really nice to be able to look around the camera from different angles.  It also added MPEG4 streaming video which is a huge improvement over refreshing the image every 3 seconds in the first generations. The web server software was also much faster in this second generation camera.  When viewing remotely, I can get 2-3 frames per second on a PC browser or about 1 FPS on my iPhone when streaming MPEG4 from the camera.I purchased this third generation BL-C230A camera and am really impressed by it. It also has pan-and-scan functionality. The CMOS sensor is very different in this model.  It has about 2-3 times the effective resolution when streaming MPEG4. The frame rate is noticeably faster and the image quality is superb. It really looks great.  Low light ability has virtually disappeared, however.  It doesn't work well in low-light at all. If you need a low-light camera, you really should get something else.  I do not need a low-light camera however, so that doesn't affect me.  For the price and how much Panasonic has improved these cameras' functionality, I'm extremely pleased, especially with the newest, 3rd generation here.If you have issues with the cameras on your network, you don't have your router and client devices configured correctly. I use static IP address assignment so that I can connect to the camera from outside my home. You must set the port forwarding to the camera from the WAN (outside from the internet) in your router so that the port is forwarded from the internet to the camera's IP address.  You also must enable UPnP in your router.  If you want to access your camera from the internet, the easiest way is to set up a free account with DynDNS.  I can't tell you how to do this, as Amazon has edited my post, removing the URL formatting with the port info. But you will be able to access your camera from any browser on the internet if you use a free DNS service like DynDNS and make sure you handle your ports correctly.If you have an iPhone, there is an app called Mobiscope that allows you to easily view these Panasonic cameras remotely. You just enter your DynDNS URL, port and login information and it will automatically bring up your camera's view screen. It's really nifty. It's also very easy to log in and remotely view the camera using the Safari browser in the iPhone. You also can configure the camera to send you text messages whenever it has detected motion.I've never had a problem with these cameras at all.  They work exceptionally well. I use several Linksys WRT54G/GL/GS routers at my home because they are so stable. I installed the powerful, free Tomato and DD-WRT firmware on them. This firmware makes it possible to very precisely control all your networked devices, especially these network cameras. These cameras, the Linksys WRT54G* family of routers and the Tomato firmware makes for an especially stable system.

I could not find another internet-ready camera that has BOTH audio and visual capabilities that was remotely reasonably priced. And I scoured the market. I have no idea why it's so difficult.I say I reluctantly purchased this camera because it is extremely painful to setup if you have a MAC and therefore cannot use the easy setup install CD that is - inexplicably - only created for PC users. I am minimally tech-savvy and have had to learn far more than I felt necessary about my router, etc.After having to setup this camera several times already (due to power outages, etc.), I have gotten the system down. I never would have been able to do so if it wasn't for the kind people like E. Kim who posted a thorough review with tips right here on Amazon and blogs like Society9.com. I would like to 'pay it forward' and help others with the insane install process as I have learned it.INSTALL TIPS & STEPS IF YOU HAVE A MAC (AND THEREFORE CANNOT USE THE EASY SETUP CD FOR PCS)NOTE: If all goes correctly, it should only take 10-15 mins. Needing to troubleshoot can add hours.  1. Plug in camera to router via LAN wire and AC adapter (make sure camera is set to \"wired\" mode to start).  2. The light must be solid green for the camera to function. If it's not green, check out the troubleshooting here (supposedly Panasonic has good customer service to help with setup but it's not 24/7 customer service so I've never been able to use it as someone who works full-time):[...]  3. TROUBLESHOOTING: I have found it to be utterly disappointing when we do not get the green light right away because it inevitably means hours of troubleshooting ahead vs. a very quick setup. When I had a FLASHING ORANGE LIGHT (2 second intervals), the following worked for me: Unplug the AC power cord from the camera, unplug the LAN cable for camera from the wireless router (instead of from the camera), hit the factory reset button underneath the camera with a pen, then plug in the LAN cable again and finally the AC power cord to the camera. After a few minutes, I finally got the amazing solid green light.  4. Once you have the green light, go to your router home page/IP address (I have a Cisco Valet so may be different on other routers - see E. Kim's review for Airport Extreme).  5. On your router home page/IP, click on DHCP reservation on the basic setup page and look for the \"extra\" connection labeled LAN IP address.  6. Go to that IP address and create a user name and password and then enter that information again when prompted, then follow the steps.  7. Your SSID is the name of your wireless network (e.g. the name you and your neighbors see on your/their list of available connections when connecting to wifi)  8. Then click on internet tab on setup page, enable auto port forwarding (to view on another computer), register for View Netcam (it's the easier IMO), and enable \"allow access from internet (ipv6)\" - that's the key  9. To change from wired format to wireless, go to wireless tab, reconfirm the info and set the switch at the bottom of the camera to wireless, then restart the camera (which means unplug the LAN wire and the AC adapter and plug the AC adapter back in). It will take a couple of minutes to get back to green so don't panic.

And though I have a Computer Science degree, who works as an engineer, I had problems setting it up myself. It took me 2 days until I finally got it going.Thanks to those who have already lavishly provided detailed instructions for others (including myself) who had problems getting this cam set up.I would like to pay my due here by detailing out the steps that I took in order to get this IP cam up and running:I configured it using Windows XP:1.) hook up the ethernet cable from your cam to the router using a free port.2.) connect the ethernet cable from your desktop (or laptop) to the router to another free port.---- up to this point, please note that both of your PC and your cam are not powered on ----3.) connect the power adapter to your cam, wait until the LED indicator blinks green.4.) power up your PC.5.) Insert the manufacture installation CD.6.) Click \"Search/Look for IP CAM\" (forgot the exact name of the button, but it is the first button on the page you see once you inserted your installation CD). If all goes well, you should be able to see both the MAC address (i.e. XX.XX.XX.XX.XX) and the IP address (i.e. 191.168.0.xxx) of your Panasonic CAM.See if you can access your cam by viewing it from a browser by clicking on \"view\" button from the installation CD Configuration Page.7.) Log onto your router configuration page (usually 192.168.0.1).8.) Go to the status page (it might be called something else due to different routers)  and see if your IP Cam is picked up by your router.9.) If your router sees your cam, assign it (your IP Cam) with a static IP Address (if you are using DHCP) by:On my router, click \"DHCP Server\", specific a range:example:\"IP Address Start: 192.168.0.xxx\" and \"IP Address End: 192.168.0.yyy\"xxx: specified by you, for example: 100yyy: ending address also speificied by you, for example: 150Hence, your IP Address Range begins from 100 - 150 (i.e. from 192.168.0.100 to 192.168.0.150)--- Assigning Static IP ---10.)Once all the above steps are done, go to \"DHCP List and Binding\" (again it might be called something else due to different router, but it is usually under \"DHCP Server\" Tab) on your router's configuration page.Once there, from the \"Static IP\" Section, put in both the mac address of your Cam and an IP Address for it:For IP Address, you could put in ex: \"192.168.0.150\" (or one that is in between the range of the IP Address you set up from the above step (step 9), which is not in used by other machines on your network).Then, click \"Mac-IP Bind\". Finally save all your setting on your router.--- Port Forwarding ---11.)Once a static IP Address is created for your IP Cam from the above step, set up a portfor your IP Cam (so that it can be viewed remotely).Again, go to your router's configuration page, click \"Virtual Server/Port Forward\":a.) Set up a starting and ending range for the port: example: 10001-10001 to the IP Address of your IP Cam (from the step above, I used \"192.168.0.150\". But yours may be different depending upon which numbers you specified it to be).b.) Portocol: use both \"TCP/UDP\"Now, go back to your Panasonic Installation Page, and click on \"Network Setup\".There you should see a pop-up page that says:\"Port NO.\" <--- put in the port number you specified from the step 11 above (ex: 10001)\"IP Address\" <-- put in the Static IP Address you specified from the step 10 above (ex: 192.168.0.150)\"Subnet Mask\" <-- 255.255.255.0\"Default Gateway\" <-- 192.168.0.1\"Primary Server Address\" <-- 192.168.0.1\"Secondary Server Address\" <-- 4.2.2.1 (important!)12.) Then click on \"Network IPv4\", and from \"Connection Mode\" choose \"Static\".Once this is setup, your Cam should restart itself and when you click on \"view\"the browser address should become: for example:\"192.168.0.150:10001\"From your Cam's Page, click on the \"Setup\" tab:a.) Then, click on uPNP and Disable it.b.) Then, click on the \"wireless\" (we are still on the \"Set up\" page)Put in your SSID, Communication Mode = \"802.11b/g\"For Cipher, use the one that your router is using.For Network Key: Put in the password.!!! If your network key contains spaces, you MUST re-set your password for the network key to another that contains no spaces !!!For example: \"PasswordToMyNetwork\" will work, but: \"Password to my network\" will not work.The last step:Go to \"DynamicDNS\" (we are still on the \"Setup\" page\")click \"Viewnetcam.com\", then click \"next\".From there, set up the name and the password to access the camera remotely.Once that is done, then your camera should be able to work remotely by typing in:\"(The name you chose with viewnetcam.com)\".viewnetcam.com:(port number you set up from step 11 above)Example: MyBabyCam.viewnetcam.com:10001From my experience, I never even used the \"Internet\" Tab to configure.EDIT:For Wireless Setup, if you have followed the steps above correctly:Simply power down your Cam, and flip the switch to \"Wireless\" andpower it up again.ALSO: If you have previously tried to set this cam up without success and would like to give this setup instruction a try: reset your IP Camera first.Should you become frustrated whilst getting this thing set up, walk away from it.Grab yourself a cup of coffee, then come back at it later.I am relocating overseas; as a result, I understand how some of you might feel, whoeither want to keep an eye on your properties or on your pet (my case) while you are away.

One area of our business is security cameras for commercial facilities, generally retail stores and small offices. This camera came up on a Gold Box deal and I wanted to give it a try and see how it would perform as a one-off system for quick surveillance applications and for those on a limited budget.  Here's the findings:Setup - Found it worked best if you used a hardwired internet connection to do the initial setup and configuration. After that the wireless worked well.  Save yourself some headaches and just plan to do the initial setup hardwired.Image quality - This is a pretty low end camera.  It gives a pretty grainy and noisy image.  I would say it's fine for general monitoring but if you want to catch detail you'll be disappointed.  NIght vision capabilities falls off pretty quickly.  Plan on this in areas with good lighting only.Features - The web interface is very nice and is fairly intuitive.  It's easy for novice users to pick up quickly.  To have PTZ capability in a camera at this price point is really nice.  Overall, I'd say the features for the price is this item's strongest area.Idea Uses - This would be good choice to monitor an area for general activity.  It's a little large and conspicuous for a \"Nanny Cam\" but could work in this application.  If you want to cover a large area and need PTZ capability on a budget, this is a pretty economical setup. I could see this used to watch over a warehouse space or monitor a remote facility. Could also be used to see if kids are home from school and what they're up to. You might also use it if you need temporary or moveable monitoring of areas with wireless network coverage.  Just set it up, plug it in and you're good to go.Overall it's a nice unit for the price.  That's why I gave it 4 stars. Cameras with these features can cost hundreds more.  If you're on a budget and need to have a way to watch an area, this could be a good choice. The camera quality is the only area where I would say it fall short of expectation.  I would like to see a little better camera even at this price point.  Right now, we have this set up on our delivery door.  We use it to see if we've received shipments as our delivery drivers know us and leave packages right inside our door.  Good example of a perfect application for this camera.  Plan on spending a little time getting it set up and forget the wireless to start.

An \"Important: Read This\" in the manual would have helped a lot.The manual also says that the MAC address of the wireless interface is 1 more than the MAC address of the wired interface (there is a wired/wireless selector switch, so only one of the MAC addresses should be active).  Since the wired MAC printed on the camera ended in 7E, I configured my wireless router filter to allow 7F, but my router has never detected a MAC ending in 7F.  This made solving the SSID problem even more frustrating, since I could never be sure if the router was blocking its actual MAC address.A lack of a built-in SMTP e-mail test added a few more days of troubleshooting, since my ISP seems to be discarding all of the notifications/screen shots and I couldn't determine if the e-mail function wasn't working or whether the ISP was trashing them.  I finally figured out that my ISP was treating incoming e-mail from the camera as spam.As others have said, low-light images are very noisy/grainy.

We finanlly figured that it was because the two ports assigned to the two cameras were closed by our ISP carrier (internet provider) which is RCN.We called RCN, apparently they closed the two ports due to security reasons as they were listed as bad ports meaning some virus may attack through the ports. That is where the ball-kicking back and forth started. RCN refused to open any ports for us, and requested that we rent static ports at about $20 each port a month. For two cameras it would add up to considerable amount of expenses ($480 a year that's crazy). RCN also stated that the Panasonic technology of using static IP address (port number) insteading of using dynamically assigned port number is hugely flawed technology. While when we called Panasonic with the feedback from RCN, Panasonic said our ISP carrier should be able to just open ports for us at no cost.We considered switching to other ISP carrier, I called a number of other internet providers, it seems for some reason they couldn't confirm they are able to open ports in new york area.For almost half a year we have spent countless number of hours on the phone, with RCN, with Panasonic, but were only kicked back and forth.Both my husband and I have long hour type of jobs, not a lot of time is left at the end of day to spend with our 4 year old.

Unfortunately, all of the forces applied to the button get funneled down to a tiny surface-mount switch, which is edge-mounted to a circuit board.  Couple that with the fact that due to RoHS requirements, the switch is attached with lead-free solder (brittle), and you have a recipe for disaster.  If you have one of these cameras and the switch has not broken yet, consider yourself lucky, and use a very light touch when you turn the camera on and off.", "Date": "June 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very poor low light camera and a pain to setup", "Author": "Speedy \"Speedy\"", "ReviewID": "R1QIIXLQ0HHCGC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After 2 hours messing with this I am going to return it.

Works like a charm.I use an AT&T; wireless 2wire router and thought I would have more difficulty setting it up based upon reviews but it worked after about an hour.  I spent more time trying to get the \"internet\" portion of the camera working (i.e. not the LAN portion).  After calling support, they said that you cannot be on your LAN when trying out this \"internet\" feature.  I had the support service rep try it from his end and he said it was working fine from the internet. I probably spent the majority of the time trying to figure this feature out so just be aware of this fact.  By the way, I used the DSN service provided free by Sony.I have been successful using the features:  sensor trigger, sound trigger, movement trigger, email images, download images.  I decided on the sensor trigger stand-alone because it provided the best type of trigger for my outdoor environment.  I set up emailing but soon became overwhelmed with \"jpeg\" emails even in the separate email account I established.  Also, when you set it to email, you cannot download the images directly.  So I now have it set on download only.  The only problem with this is that the images are in a Sony proprietary format so I had to find a viewer on the Sony website to view these images.  They are not in JPEG format when you directly download.  I have my trigger settings at 1 sec, 5 sec before and 5 sec after.  640x480.  I get about 18 hours of images before they start to be overwritten.  The images at night are all right for me.

It was the best tech support experience I had.  I bought two BL-C230A cameras and spent 4.5 hours to get it to work in wireless mode and with internet access with no luck.  Although there are hints and tips on comments from reviewers, I couldn't understand all the descriptions given.  Some of the good instructions I received from Panasonic are: First, connect camera to router with ethernet cable, then run EasySetup after you've run the \"search for camera\" with Panny's provided software.  Look in your router to see what address was given to the cam.  Take the address given and use to gain access to and setting up the camera.  Cut and past your wireless router SSID and key from your wireless router's screen onto the camera's setup screen for wireless setup.  Use 4.2.2.1 as secondary address, which is Panasonic's server address (DON'T use your internet service provider's server address).  Use static IP address.  Go to your router's \"port forwarding\" tab and select your device's IP address and change the TCP port to 80000, for example.  check your router encryption setting and set the camera accordingly so that it can connect to the router. After these steps are done, then switch from wired connection to wireless connection. Panasonic tech support helped me set up 2 units step by step, and they finally work.  If you do everything properly, it would take less than 10 minutes.  You need to know your router's SSID and key and to access your router's as an admin.  The next step for me is to learn how to access my cameras using an iPhone.  Some people seem to be able to do that.UPDATE:  After a few days of use, I find that connecting to the camera via internet is too iffy.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  Each of the two cameras I set up has the same problem.  It's nice to be able to view the cameras using iPhone or iPad, when they work properly.  For the price, I expected it to work flawlessly once setup is completed and the cameras are up and running.  This is likely to be returned to Amazon.com.UPDATE #2:  It appears that signal quality of the BL-C230A camera degrades as it is kept powered on.  I have been puzzled as to why the cameras would stop working after short while.  I pinged them and discovered signals were at 25% to 75% loss.  I then unplugged/plugged their power supply to reboot the cameras.  Alas! After rebooting, signal quality was at 100%!  I think there is a serious bug with this BL-C230A cameras.  I need to call Panasonic and consult with them on this.  Maybe there is a firmware update.

It is not always easy to find a surveillance product that works in a web browser and does not rely on Windows Internet Explorer plug-ins. This one uses Java which is universal. One caveat: Ubuntu has switched to Icedtea/OpenJDK from Sun Java, and Firefox crashes when accessing the netcam using icedtea. You can find out which Java you have by typing \"sudo update-java-alternatives -l\" in a terminal. The easiest way to make sure that you have Sun Java is to completely remove Icedtea/OpenJDK and then install sun-java6-jre. Make sure you also install the sun-java6-plugin as this is what enables your web browser to run Java apps!The wireless setup was pretty straight-forward. You plug an Ethernet cable into the cam and configure the cam with a web browser. This was the only time I had to look into the installation manual. In retrospect, of course you have to tell the cam the wireless password for your router before it can connect, so you need to plug in the cable once-duh!

Updated firmware to v4.31R00 (from v4.13R01) using the browser (not from the setup app). Changed IP to Static. Setup Wireless (SSID, WEP). Everything was fine and dandy until it came time to switch to wireless mode. First I unplugged the power from the camera then flipped the switch from Wired to Wireless then plugged the power back in. The camera went thru its usual initializing mode but then the Power LED just kept on flashing in amber and never went to green so that meant it was never ready.Several things went thru my mind at the time. 1) It couldn't establish wireless connection with the router (wrong WEP key, wrong SSID etc.) 2) It's not compatible with my AirLink N router 3) Static IP conflict...I then tried pinging the camera's IP and the reply was coming from the IP of the laptop I was using to do the setup (the laptop auto obtains IP and is wireless) which was very strange.I decided to reset all back to factory default settings and restarted the setup over from scratch - this time I used a Wired PC to do the setup. I went thru the same steps as before this time I made sure to match the Router's SSID exactly caps and all.

If you select email as the method of image transfer, you will receive an email for each image captured (with image attached) during that event - typically 9-12 images/event.And finally, the included DVR software causes a 'blue screen' (BSOD) about every 48 hours on my Windows 7 laptop.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Impressive little camera in a compact package!", "Author": "RKA", "ReviewID": "R3LN3YGX82EG6M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I picked this up to use as a pet cam.  Amazon delivered it last night, and I had it up and running within an hour, including setting up access from a web browswer outside the network.  Honestly, knowing little about networking and knowing how troublesome some of these internet cameras can be, I was dreading this part, but I followed the instructions and it was a breeze.  Picture quality is grainy, but I wasn't expecting miracles under a $150 budget.  I will say under average lighing it's worse than the sample puppy pic Amazon uses to advertise this unit.  If image quality is important to you, I would suggest you spend more for one of their other cameras that offer a larger CCD sensor which should give you dramatically better picture quality and the ability to use it in the dark.  In any event, I feel I got what I paid for in picture quality and wasn't willing to spend more for something better.  The camera works great!  There are lots of mixed reviews about this cam which made me a little uncomfortable spending the money.  To be fair, the networking issues can happen with any of these cameras and I think it's a bit unfair to fault the makers for things outside of their control.  For this camera in particular, installation is quite easy if the stars align.  If they don't, Panasonic supposedly has great customer support (which I thankfully didn't need to call).Other stuff:  The video wouldn't play on my smartphone when using the URL I set up.  That's an issue with my phone, not Panasonic.  However I was able to download an app from Android Market that would allow me to view the video and control the cam.  Took 5 minutes to set that up.  Video gets choppy here, but that's expected with mpeg and smartphones.  Haven't found a way to change to H264 through this app (on my computer I can change between mpeg and H264).

Access over the internet is obviously key for this.The installation went without a hitch, once I figured out that the initial hardware connection to the router for setup apparently means just that, not to the local network but literally to the physical router.  I then followed the instructions, with some trepidation (based on some of the other reviews here) to set up the DDNS service so that it could be accessed over the internet.  Everything proceeded smoothly, and I was soon looking at pictures on my iPhone over the 3G connection and with my laptop's WWAN card.

It still works fine over the LAN.

From other reviews, I knew that the camera wasn't going to excel at night vision.  That's an understatement. Picture quality in low light is poor and very noisy (think speckles all over the picture).  I usually leave a floor lamp on, which for me does the trick.  Picture quality in the daytime or well lit environments is stellar using the H264 setting.Audio quality is also great using the H264 setting, although I can only see and hear simultaneously when using Internet Explorer.Setup can be tricky, so get some help (or call their tech support) if you're less technically inclined or have a complicated home setup.  I purchased an app from the Android Market (called IP Cam Viewer) which is incredible and works flawlessly for streaming this and other cameras to my mobile phone (Droid X).  I can also click and drag using my finger to move the camera.Viewing using any internet connected computer is great with Panasonic's easy to use built in interface.  There are lots of menus, but underneath all of them are a plethora of options for customizing everything including when you want the camera to operate, who can access the camera remotely, alarm sounds, triggers for when it will store a photo in its internal memory, etc.Panasonic's Dynamic DNS feature was a breeze to set up, and works like a charm.

I work in IT, but not in networking, and I know I am network-challenged!  So, with taking pieces from the various postings, I have now gotten the camera working wirelessly with my Airport router.  The next piece that I don't understand so well is the Port Forwarding piece - but I'm sure I'll figure it out.  If it helps anyone, once you get into the camera's firmware setup (by entering the IP address of the camera into your browser's URL), there is a lot of diagnostic information there showing you how things are set up.  It appears that the PnP piece is not enabled for the Apple Router simply means that if you have an apple router, it won't automatically set up port forwarding for you - you have to go into the router setup and do it.  This is the piece I still haven't done, so I can't see it online yet.The biggest mystery to me was being able to have it hosted online - and Panasonic has taken the mystery out of it for me by offering the hosting service, and setting THAT up was easy....  but I can't see it yet because of the port forwarding settings....  I am optimistic, though.I first attached the camera with an ethernet cable to my router, and then (on a PC, not a Mac), put the setup disk in the drive, and was able to \"find\" the camera on the network, and then go about setting up the wireless settings both for the camera and router.  Once the IP address of the camera is established using the PC-based setup software, the setup for the camera can be accessed using Safari with no problem.  At one point, I had the camera talking wirelessly to the router (green light on the camera), but I couldn't access the IP address....  There IS a little hole in the camera that you can insert a paperclip into in order to reset the factory defaults and start over....  I had to do this only once!  (Yay). At each obstacle, I realized the problem was a setting I had a typo in, or that didn't match from router to camera.  Even not putting the correct name of my wireless network in at one point. But there are so many factors, one little thing can catch you up - and once you get frustrated, it's all over!  (walk away and come back to it instead of spending lots of time frustrated - you'll only make it worse!).The picture quality is fine for what this is - no - it doesn't have IR for low light.  It DOES have 3 resolutions to view at, the pan/tilt works fine - and you can choose the picture quality if you are willing to sacrifice frames-per-second (motion fluidity)....  There are some options there....  As far as the documentation that come with it - they do give a lot of information to guide you in the camera's setup (descriptions of what fields are in the margins, etc).  But knowing the nature of the setup - and that I was using the Apple router, I kinda knew I was on my own....Overall, I give 4 stars because it really is a nice camera.  Whether it's \"too hard' to set up, is relative to how much you have dealt with this kind of setup.  If you still can't program your VCR (vcr? what's that - DVR, I guess), then you'll need help setting this up.  If you set something like this up maybe every year or so, you'll spend some time doing it....

This isn't unique to panasonic as I can't find any other camera who's audio will play on a mac. The audio requires active X and active X is PC only. It's a shame because the audio is quite good.

Got it hooked up in wired mode just fine, but it wouldn't connect in wireless mode.  Finally figured out (on only second try), that I needed to use the drop-down box to select the specific type of wi-fi encryption we have.  Once I did that, everything went like clockwork.  Web setup is great...the interface was pretty straightforward.  I'd say even with the false start, it was up and web-accessible in maybe an hour or so (and some of that time is b/c our router is a pain to deal with).I would note as others have that the picture gets very grainy if the light is low.  That doesn't bother me b/c we'll mainly be using it during the day anyway.  I imagine the few reviews that complained about picture quality happened to install theirs when the light was low.I would definitely recommend this product for someone who is at least moderately tech savvy.

If it were me, I would get a cheap desktop computer and put a couple terabyte hard drives in there and let this puppy just record away at will.

However, through my windows laptop, the video works really well. I've used it to monitor my house when we are away on vacations.The installation, together with wireless connection, was very easy. Basically, you just plug in the network cord, the power cord, and wait for the led to turn green and that's it. For the wireless connection, you do need to connect it first on the wired network, then set up the wireless authentication via your web browser. After that, you can just place the camara anywhere in the house as long as there is a power plug in reach.A very nice thing that Panasonic has done is that the camera comes with a free Dynamic DNS service FREE FOREVER. This means you can create a DNS name you choose to connect to your camera anywhere on the Internet. Yes, a password is required to access the camera.You can set up triggers (motion detection, timer) and response actions (image transfer, notification). Image transfer supports email, FTP and HTTP transfer. Notification supports email and http notification. It means that when the camera is triggered by motion detection for example, the camera will notify you and send you the captured images right away. With email SMTP services that mostly comes free with your Internet Service Provider and others that offer large amount of free online archive storage nowadays, what I chose is email image transfer and email notification using my Verizon SMTP service and Yahoo email account.To set up the motion detection trigger with image transfer and notification with Verizon and Yahoo, follow the following steps: (I'll skip some steps that are already explained well by the on-screen instructions)first connect your browser to the cameraset up > trigger > motion detection > enable image buffer/transfer >choose 'send email notification' at the bottom of page >Email Transfer'SMTP server IP Address or Host Name' > outgoing.verizon.net'Port number' > 587'Reply Email Address' > xxxx@yahoo.com'Destination Email Address1' > xxxx@yahoo.comHow to Authenticatechoose 'SMTP authentication''Login ID' > your Verion id  without @verizon.net)'Password' > your passwordthen 'Save' and that's it.Now you will receive email notification and images sent to your Yahoo email everytime there is a trigger. Besure to tune how many images you want to transfer. If not, you can get over 100 images in just few seonds. The camera also has built-in memory buffer that stores captured images. So, you may just choose to receive email notifications and then access the camera for the captured images.The camera also comes with a PC application that you can install and runs on a PC. It can be set up to stay onnected to your camera all the time and it has a separate motion detection machnism. You can save and archive catured images as well as save the live video feed around the clock if you choose (only limited by your harddisk size) as a surveillance camera.The image quality is very good and sufficient in my opinion for general requirements. You can monitor the audio input from the camera as well, and its quality and sensitivity is amazing. I can monitor the conversation from people 20ft away from the camara.There is no infra-red on this camara. Even it does, most of them normally won't work well beyond 10 ft. However, the image at low light condition is actually very good. Of course, this is all relative to your requirements. Without comparison, it's really hard to say it's good or not. I can only say it is sufficient for general requirements.There are two things to remember, if you use it as a survellance camara. 1) turn off the blinking light on the front face of the camera via set up so it's not so obvious to the thief you are watching, 2) don't pan/tilt the camera when you are watching, because it would create a noise audiable to anyone in the same room.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "A couple of hours invested security", "Author": "Film n File", "ReviewID": "RC1YSNAI8SQSC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only tried one other brand.

Since it is an INDOOR camera, I mounted it on a tripod looking out the window and found that the set up process was relatively straight forward for my experience level.  I'm not one to do port forwarding and making other changes to settings I know nothing about so this walked me through step by step and I had the camera running in less than 30 minutes.  I installed it in the \"Wired\" mode despite the fact I had wireless in the house.  A decision driven mainly by the fact I wanted to minimize any future problems while viewing from afar.  Some observations: After going through the install process, I unplugged the camera from the AC outlet and moved it to its current position.  Once plugged back in, it came right back on line indicating that during power outages it may do the same.  I did NOT unplug the CAT-5 cable during the relocationhowever so don't know what impact that might have had on moving the camera.  The camera microphone is very sensitive and picks up many of the mundane noises within the house.  I also get feedback into my computer and constantly have to turn the sound down on the camera control page but one could also simply move the computer further away I suppose.  I don't fully understand all the capabilities or operational points on the camera yet but will try to study the manual a little more to see what the characteristics are and how I can use them.  The manual, like many is not that clear in some aspects.  The biggest complaint I have however is that the 3X zoom is worthless to me.  When you attempt to zoom into something within the camera's view, you immediately begin to loose resolution of the picture and it quickly becomes a gaggle of large pixels where you cannot distinguish anything in view.  I like the snapshot feature (better than my Samsungs)and I like the tilt and pan ranges along with the pre-sets (you can establish your own preset points which is another plus for the system).  Once the sun goes down however, the camera is not worth much at all.  Other than a reflection in my window, the camera sees nothing outside!  Not even the trees 3 feet outside the window.  Some of the alarm sounds are hookey....dog barks that sound rather rediculous.  Another plus though is that my family and friends can operate the camera via the internet once they are set up to do so.  I'm not dissatisfied with the purchase but wish some of the things I thought were inherent in the camera were better engineered (like the zoom and night vision limitations).

This may have helped our installation, which went off with no problems.  The only part of the procedure that we needed to modify was when the Panasonic software filled in a default value of the SSID and the instructions never mentioned filling in the correct value.  But since we had read the reviews here, we knew to watch out for that.  We filled in the correct value and let the automatic setup handle the rest.  So far no problems.  The night vision is about what you should expect from a camera in this price range and is much better than the Dropcam.  Also the motion detection works much better too, even in low light.  The viewnetcam sofware is quite powerful, but you made need to spend some time getting it set up just the way you want, especially having it send out email based on a timer (a nice feature) or from motion detection.

That was it for wireless. It still works as a wired camera so I may add it as a second camera at some point. I spent much time researching whether to buy a refurbished 131 or to try the 230 at the same price. I decided to give the 230 a try.The 230 set up is exactly the same as the 131. I did a print screen of all my settings on the 131 for an easy transition. There was one exception - I had to completely remove any trace of the 131 from my computer, my router firewall settings (including user-defined port forwarding), and cancel my existing viewnetcam.com and register new (which stinks because you have to get a new URL). I learned this with the help of Panasonic tech support. No wireless issues for me as other reviewers have mentioned.Viewing the 230 is slightly different than the 131, but something I can get use to. The video quality is better, almost HD with standard image (even our tech people at the office are impressed). The movements of my cats are fluid on the 230. With the 131 the movement was almost stop action. Changing the camera angles moves faster too. The night viewing is almost non-existent (on both cameras) unless you have overhead lighting and a bunch of lamps on. I have not tried or set up any recording other than for viewing. All I had to do was change to the new URL and password on the recording software; no having to uninstall and reinstall the recording software.For both the 131 and 230, it would be nice if you could move the lens more to the left and right. Also, it would be nice if they had an outdoor version of this camera (perhaps they do but probably out of my price range). But, other than night vision, I get a good shot when its in a window facing outside.I had problems with accessing it via my droid phone. I found out after I got the droid that viewnetcam is not supported with a droid and the only support is with an iPhone. However, if you use [...] you get a live image (I don't think it's a stream).When I purchased the 131 almost 2 years ago, the Panasonic tech support was outstanding. Not anymore. I recommend that when you first encounter resistance, an inability to be cooperative, or a distracted tech, politely end the call and keep calling back until you get someone that sounds, and is, professional. When you get the right person, everything falls into place.All in all, for the money, this is a great camera. I hope to have it for many years.

It was a little difficult to setup on an iMac using a linksys router so I used my work laptop PC and the installation CD.  I had some problems with port forwarding (not sure what this is used for).  When I enabled it, it was accessing port 50000 and even though I have done tech support for years, I am not that network savvy to know how to allow access to this port with my router software, so I disabled it.  Now it accesses port 80.  Another hurdle was that the SSID gets assigned by the camera software to some version of \"NetCameraXXXX\".  When I went to the online support, I realized that the SSID for the camera must match the SSID for my router.  Once I fixed these two issues, there are no problems using the camera in wireless mode except that I cannot figure out how to use the triggers (sound, motion and heat).  I set them up to match my email SMTP and POP settings, however no emails were triggered and the error log yielded numerous errors.  I suspect it may have to do with that pesky port forwarding.

Motion detection works great!Some minor issues:(1) I am an Apple Mac user and had to borrow a Microsoft Windows machine for the initial set-up.

I purchased a standard digital timer that 'resets' the camera every 8 hours - so I no longer have to worry about not being able to connect to the camera.(3) It's a little tricky to get the trigger configuration settings correct to send e-mails when motion is detected.  By default, the camera will send a large number of e-mails to you - be careful!!  Tweak the number of pre and post detection e-mails to a small number.  Your 'inbox' will appreciate it.

The camera software is not supported on MAC.  If you do not care about the camera software, I advise that you do not buy if you have a home network with printers, bluray players, internet TV, smart phones, sling boxes, etc.  The reason is that the DHCP home router will assign an IP address to your camera, and with the MAC installation process, the camera can only be found by trial-and-error of entering each possible IP address until you are lucky enough to find the right one ... Again, the MAc installation process can not automatically find the camera.  When you have 20+ devises on your home network, the Panasonic camera randomly selects an IP address.What did I do - I spent all day saturday trying to make it work.  I design IP networks and i still had all these problems.  On Monday, I spent 5 hours with Panasonic.  Very nice and helpful people, but they simply did not know what to do given that I have so many devices  on my home network .. we could not find the camera.  We gave up.What did amazon do - they were perfect.  They gave me a full refund.Though the process was very disappointing, everyone was professional and very helpful.

The list price for this camera is 199 but I bought one on a Gold Box deal for 149 and another one as a refurbished unit for about $140 and for that price, this camera is an excellent deal. The web page to set up the device is a little bit complicated and you do need to know how to set up things such as port numbers, dynamic dns etc but if you can (or have a technologically aware friend who can), this unit is excellent. Once the setup is done, you can simply plug it in anywhere (it does need a power outlet btw) and leave it on the whole time. I have set it up to trigger and send e-mails with pictures to my cell phone so I do need to remember to sneak under it and turn it off when I get back home. There is any option to limit the trigger by time but then it will turn off at a specified time when you may not be home for one reason or another. I can check the live feed on my desktop @work and also on my cell phone without any issues. The other good thing about this camera is that even though it does not have night vision, you can set it up to send mail if there is too much sound or a temperature change in its scanning area. I also like the camera's ability to pan and zoom via the web interface so you are not limited to looking at what the camera is pointed to.

Adding to this is the fact that when you do have troubles, Panasonic has no end-user tech support, leaving you completely on your own.After doing quite a bit of homework on these types of devices, I settled on the BL-C230A to help me monitor my aging mom in her guest house about 50 yards from my router in the main home. Not being familiar with these sorts of gadgets, but being a software engineer for over 25 years now, I figured it would take a bit of learning and fiddling to get these two cameras set up, and I was right. But after a couple of hours both were working fine in wireless mode. Or so I thought.After a couple of weeks, camera 2 started to lose reliability in connecting -- sometimes it was there, and sometimes not. I would take it back to the main house, test it, and sometimes it would just \"wake back up\"; other times I had to reset it and reconfigure it from scratch. Then it would work for another week or two and then \"fade away\" again. I thought distance from the router may be a factor, so as a test I ran it in my main house not 30 feet from the router for over a week. No change -- it went brain-dead by day four, again requiring reconfig to restore it from it's self-induced coma.But that left me with camera 1, which overall seemed to be better behaved once I got it located in a spot it liked. But this morning it too, finally went dark, and no matter what I tried with this unit, it simply refused to work in Wireless mode. With the cable attached, no problem, but the second I detached the RJ45 cable, engaged the \"Wireless\" switch and powered it back up, it would go through its standard start routine, but when it got to where the LED went from blinking green to steady (indicating it had a connection and an IP address), it would suddenly start blinking orange on and off, and did so for the next hour until I finally powered it down. I wasted about 3 hours on it before I called it a lost cause.So I'm once again looking for a good wireless IP camera, maybe one that actually works as its manufacturer claims, doesn't need constant fiddling every other week, and maybe even is made by a company that knows what \"tech support\" means.

They have outstanding customer support.  They give you FREE model specific router instuctions. And if you still have problems they will do it for you for a modest charge. I had them set it up for me, saved countless hours setup time. I do reccomend this camera but be prepared to use a vague set up procedure per instructions. From what I have read in these reviews, its going to be easy and go smoothly or be some what of a nightmare. Nothing in between.

It has died and is no longer working. No clue why because I only used it 3 times. What a waste of money of $300. I just bought it last year! So my 3 star is now a 1 star.The camera itself is great, better images and sound quality than at least 98% of camera's that I have used or view. The part that kills is installation. Sure they offer help with an IT tech for 140$. The camera is $299 why should I have to pay that much more for installation? The videos are good but don't help with features like recording and storing images. The directions are hard to read.My boyfriend is a computer science major and graudates in 3 months but had a hard time setting it up.

We use a Siemans SE-567 modem/router for our home wireless network and was unable to get the camera connected to work in wireless mode after about 10 hours of trying.  I read all the operating, setup and troubleshooting manuals provided by Panasonic and online forums to try to figure out what was wrong but was unsuccessful.  I did like the camera, its price and the thought of having a nice wireless system for the house and something I could access from any computer but hooking up this system can be very frustrating to the average computer savvy user. Unfortunately, Panasonic doesn't provide any 800 number to call for help, so you are pretty much on your own with any problems you may run into.

Don't confuse this \"DIGITAL ZOOM\" this with \"optical zoom\" which DOES use the lens for zooming. If you are using fake zoom (digital), you would get better results on zooming using post-processing video software.  It is reported, that the software to make this camera useful over the Internet has to be purchased separately at an additional cost of $400 for the Internet software! That's right, additional cost!  That makes the total cost around $700; this camera is a very costly.  Please correct me if I'm wrong, but if you do so, please site your sources.  Other wireless Internet cams COME WITH THE INTERNET SOFTWARE FREE OF CHARGE.  Can someone please provide video and still shots from this camera to prove the image quality if this \"tiny \" lens? Post same here for a video review.  Why are the no personal photos or video posted if this is so good?  I would watch out for \"review-writers\".  I hear \"review-writers\" are people with home computer that have fell for the \"work-from-home\" gimmicks and get paid to write 5-star reviews for various companies.  I was interested in this camera until I found out about the \"surprise\" cost of the Internet software to make it actually useful.  If I were you, I would read about the many other cameras on the market that do provide the Internet software before this purchase.
