Terrific Customer Service.", "Author": "alliesmom", "ReviewID": "R1XEIS3RVGE3Z5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the second set of camera's I purchased from Sharx Security installed at 2 different homes.  This model is the newer model, has outstanding resolution and is very easy to set up. Not only is the camera top notch and highly recommended (no DVR required and smaller camera footprint than other cameras I compared), but the support team is SO accessible and helpful that any questions I had were quickly and professionally resolved.  I made an appointment with them to help me and when we found out that one of the camera's didn't have power and needed to have the electrician return to fix it, the support team checked in with me multiple times to see how the work was progressing.  Then when power was restored, the 3 camera's were set up in less than 30 minutes.I highly recommend Sharx Security camera's.", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera!!", "Author": "Robert R Schmitt", "ReviewID": "RWS8ZJIIMM7DP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera with amazing resolution.  Physical installation is easy and everything is provided.  I have ATT Uverse with their latest router.  Once I found its IP address I simply followed the instruction booklet, which was very accurate, and the camera became operational.  Daytime color and nighttime IFR vision is outstanding.  The camera is pretty far from my router with several walls in between so I will likely install a WiFi range extender so I can get the full 5 bars in reception.  My next step is to do the port forwarding, etc., for offsite access on my iPhone and iPad.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very good resolution and easy access to the recorded videos and stills", "Author": "Rubing", "ReviewID": "R11YW7UNT5LDD6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have crazy neighbors. I feel safer now that I have one of these cameras watching the front of my house from the balcony. If one of the neighbors is up to no good, the camera resolution is enough to identify them without a doubt. There are lots of features. The one that matters most to me is that the recorded video can be downloaded easily from the MicroSD if you need to send it to the police. My previous system with separate CCTV cameras and DVR box could only play back the video on its own screen but there was no easy way to get the video out. Another thing I like about the Sharx camera is that they don't charge you a monthly fee or put limits on accessing your own video. I will never buy another system that keeps the video locked up in a proprietary box. Some companies are advertising cloud servers, but I don't ever want to pay monthly fees or be dependent on anyone else to get my own video.", "Date": "May 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Solid Construction & Great Video Quality", "Author": "mike lancsek", "ReviewID": "R2QX3L2H9TU5N6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You get what you pay for!  When I received my first Sharx SCNC3605N in 2012, I wasn't so sure (there were similar specs from other manufactures for less money).  Well, I wound up going through 3 other outdoor camera manufactures to finally find the simplicity and picture quality of Sharx.  I have now upgraded to the SCN3905 and the image quality is superb!  These cameras are really thought through; including the manual and camera software which are easy to use and read.  Super solid construction with a weather proof connection box, and a mounting bracket that actually locks in place.  Tech support has been very responsive and courteous to any concerns with their products (local US company). Combine quality, support, and a company that stands firmly behind there cameras, and you have a great product.  These cameras are worth every penny ... period.  Highly recommended!", "Date": "April 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great HD camera from a great company", "Author": "mister_t42", "ReviewID": "R2C06PO6MZ0RFV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera.  I upgraded from an older Sharx camera with a lot lower resolution, and the difference is a significant improvement.  I can now read license plates on cars as they pull down my driveway, where before I had no hope of doing that.  Installation was easy; just connect camera to your network via Ethernet cable, find the IP address that gets assigned, go in and change settings, then setup wifi and it is ready to rock and roll.  It took me all of ten minutes to have it ready to mount.  Since it is mounted outdoors, I used the supplied weatherproof box for the connections; this is a nice improvement that the older camera didn't include.  BTW, I used Blueiris software as my DVR; it works great with Sharx equipment.  All in all, this is a great camera and I highly recommend it.  PS. My old camera was blown off its mount in a hurricane and Sharx repaired it at no cost; this was a big factor in why I stuck with this particular brand.", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent security camera and works great with linux", "Author": "Bob S.", "ReviewID": "R3BFR8YBJP9DWD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very satisfied with camera and wifi performance. Mounted camera under an eave about fifty feet from the wireless router with a reinforced concrete wall in the way and still have 5 bars signal strength. Even before buying, Sharx provided quick answers on mounting questions. I spliced about 15' of low voltage wire to the transformer's low voltage side to avoid having to wire house current to a new exterior outlet. Works great with a linux computer and firefox (no sound which is fine with me). Only installation glitch was the low voltage power cord plug separated from its socket while mounting the holder under the eaves, so don't let the mounting holder dangle by the power cord. Would definitely buy again.", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent!", "Author": "Just Another Old Fart", "ReviewID": "R1KQUFPOHCJPCA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Most of the time you get what you pay for, and this is one of those times.  It is a bit expensive but it is also a very good camera.  I had a bit of trouble getting my gmail account set up to send out the pictures taken by the camera when it detects motion (a very handy feature, btw), but the support from Sharx has been outstanding!  I plan on getting another one for the back yard.  One other thing, the wireless set up was a breeze because my router has universal plug and play (UPnP), if your router does not have it and you want to use it in wireless mode you might want to upgrade your router first.", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wireless camera with SD Card means this is truly a standalone all in one system.", "Author": "Matthew L. Jackson \"dub\"", "ReviewID": "RJ3OGZC567GXB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You have a few options when selecting a security camera.  You can go with a wired system where the camera connects directly to a DVR.  You can POE (Power over Ethernet) where where the camera connects to your network router.  Or you can go wireless (assuming your wifi can reach outside to the camera).  I went with this camera because it has wireless and a built in SD Card slot.  So it just sits there and records all day long.  I don't have a DVR or wires to my router.  It a stand alone system.  All I had to do was run power to it.  Sharx online support is very very helpful.  I had two networks and they helped me get everything setup so I can view the feed over the web or smartphone.  The video and audio is very clear.
