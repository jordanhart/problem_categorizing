{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The best bullet camera Toshiba ever made", "Author": "dmbTank", "ReviewID": "R1MNP5R6V3YUZ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well thought out and executed!I have continuously ran Toshiba outdoor cameras since 2004 without ever one incident.  After 8+ years of harsh life outdoors, I am upgrading my old tech cameras.  I decided to stay with Toshiba because of proven reliable service.The WB81A is one of Toshiba's newer cameras and features some nice improvements.1). The lens housing is now configured in a way to reduce/eliminate the internal ghosting from IR led reflections, Now a physical barrier between the lens element and the IR LEDS.2). Not new but certainly appreciated is the remote focus and zoom, making setup painless.3). Fully support for Power over Ethernet.  Forget the power cables; supply the necessary power over the same ethernet as the camera. You can get one for as little as $19.00 or buy a POE multi port switch, and power all your cameras from one central power source.4). Clarity and high def, This 2MP camera with wide dynamic range supports about 12ftps at the higest res. Wonderfully and beautifully rendered.5). Low light IR down to .004 lux, yes, true night vision out of the box at about 80 feet.  If you need supplement IR lights, to increase coverage, go for it, they run around $100.00 and up.6). Easy discovery and network setup, using the supplied wizard software.7). Supports mic and speakers, plug and  play, just make sure they support outdoor life.8). Multi Stream, see below.More details:The camera arrives with everything you need for the hardware install. Templates, weatherproofing, wrenches, etc.  I installed mine in 30 minutes,  I already had the Ethernet ran to the location.  Camera comes with sunshade.You will require a drill, with screw heads to bolt it up.Fully adjustable housing support. up, down, left and right - no worries, with a safety catch for the camera body, to fully disengage, unplug the Ethernet, remove two screws, and then the safety catch.Powering your new monster: You need a POE switch or injector, I bought a switch supporting my 4 cameras, works perfectly for my 200+ feet of Ethernet runs.Software: The included software is basic at best, but supports everything the camera offers; motion detection, alarms, sound, recording,  For the money I recommend BlueIris, the best 50 bucks you will spend to support most all your cameras.This camera supports multi streams: One stream URL can be the maximum resolution, while another can be for your iphone.  Multi stream allows you to set up multi views from the same camera; one zoomed in, the other wide., etc. Trust me, this is something you want in a camera.This camera supports open source and therefore software such as blueiris works very well with it.Overall this Toshiba Camera is ROCK SOLID in build with die cast aluminum, sealed from the harsh elements, and ready for action.", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$867.20", "Features": "Remote optical zoom and one-touch remote auto focus for faster installation.\nFull 1080p HD video high resolution image capture. 3.7-9mm varifocal lens.\nAdvanced SRLED technology providing 53 degree illumination angle for edge to edge lighting.
