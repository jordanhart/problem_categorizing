{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great system with very few flaws", "Author": "W. Nichols", "ReviewID": "RB41CJZWD6BVW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I try to keep up writing reviews for products I buy, especially the items that I myself do a lot of research on, before buying. So I'll break this down as best I can. I live in a 2-story, 2800 square foot home. And for the longest time, I've wanted a surveillance system to make me feel safe both when I am at home and away. The Logitech camera system and software does it right, with only a few minor issues, and I stress minor.I have an Apple router but run Windows 7 on my PC; I'm also using the free application on my iPhone. I had zero problems with the software install, even when it came to Window's firewall. I'm currently running 2 indoor cameras and 1 outdoor camera...but, I actually plan on using nothing but outdoor cameras for my entire system (to include for inside surveillance). And that's about the only real issue I have with the system. The indoor camera works awesome and does what it should. It delivers good quality color video and even over the iPhone application or over the web (from Logitech's website), all of my friends all have said, \"Wow, that looks awesome!\" BUT, and it's a big BUT, once the sun goes down, the indoor cameras are very limited. Shy of the bad guy turning on all of the lights in my house, then committing his crime, the indoor camera is of little use during nighttime hours. And at first, I was okay with that because I'm home at night and it's actually the daytime when nobody is home. But then I bought the outdoor Logitech camera and WOW, what a difference because it holds the very same quality as the indoor camera, but also does a phenomenal job at night. So with that, I'm going to return the indoor cameras and use the outdoor cameras for outside as well as inside. But I still want to give my review on the indoor camera as I've been using it for about a month now.Pros:Color Quality. Again, great color quality. Even using the digital zoom, I was impressed at how good it looks. My wife being the glass half empty type of person commented that you can't see the face of the person all that well. But my reply was - but you can sure as heck see his race, clothing description, weight, height, hair color and most importantly you can see if he is or isn't wearing gloves...hence, you could see clearly where he may have left evidence (fingerprints, DNA, etc).Included 2GB media card. This is a great feature!! This means that if bad guy breaks in and thinks he's outsmarting you by stealing your computer (with the footage of him), you can still revert back to the camera itself to retrieve the footage saved to the media card. Another great thing about the camera media card is that your home computer does not need to be always on to be recording. For example, my computer goes into sleep mode after about an hour of inactivity. So if my computer is in hibernate mode for a full day, the cameras are still recording footage and will sync to my computer when it awakes. For it to work seamless, I just leave the Logitech software running in the task bar (background).Software. Logitech did it right with the software. It was a very easy install, features are clear and I love that you can customize each camera you have on your network. For example, out of the 3 cameras I have, I only want 1 of them to send off text message alerts. Again, it's nice that the alerts are not just a system feature, but rather an individual camera setting. You can also adjust the duration of alerts to save yourself from getting thousand texts. For me, a 5 minute window is perfect, just as long as I get the initial text, I wouldn't be concerned about getting 20 more in under a 5 minute or however long of a window you choose. I also like the way the software saves all of the recorded video. With 3 cameras going, I've been getting a lot of recorded footage. The software not only allows you to use choose a given date and time to research, but if you were to search out for that file in Windows explorer, the software does a great job by saving the footage under the name of camera (for example \"Living Room\"), then the month (10 for October), then the day within that month. Being a police officer, I really like that if I had to turn over crucial footage (if my home was burglarized, etc), all of the footage would have clear a folder structure and time stamp that would make sense to any other investigating officer.Alerts. This feature sealed the deal for me buying this system to begin with. You select a zone in which if motion occurs, an alert will be sent. For example, although my camera has a pretty wide shot of my living room to include front door, my only concern is if movement is picked up at the front door. Once motion is detected, a text message is sent to my phone. The alert text message is awesome; it says what camera picked up what motion and at what date and time...simple and efficient. BUT, I will mention alerts in the Cons section, so please read on.Camera size. Again, I have both the indoor and outside camera and was very impressed by how small they were. I also lucked out that I have power sources on top of my potter shelves, so I was able to plug in the cameras without any wires being run down walls, etc. And because the cameras are small, I've actually told friends that I have the cameras and it still took them a while to actually figure out where.The \"wow\" factor. I'll admit it, I'm that guy who loves his tech toys, who loves showing off new technology and how I make it work for my family's safety. The first day when I showed all of my police friends the system, everyone was amazed. I should get a kick back from Logitech on all of the potential customers I made for them. Being able to open the iPhone app and show my friends that I have 24/7 surveillance of my home, felt very cool. The iPhone app also works very well over 3g cell service (not just wi-fi).Cons:Price. Well I mentioned the \"wow\" factor when I showed off the system to my friends. Well, I got the same expression when I told them how much. For me to get 6 cameras, all of them being the outdoor cameras, is a bit pricey. But, I will say that the software being free is nice. It's also nice to know that each camera comes with that 2GB media card (another plus that make the high costs seem understandable). And although I'm not that interested in audio, again, if you're going to pay the big bucks for a camera, at least it gives you color and audio as an option.Night time quality. Again, if all you care about is crystal clear footage in the daytime, then the indoor camera is for you. But for me, I began to get frustrated that for so much money, I was only getting daytime footage. For a bit more money per camera, I feel that it was well worth it, to be able to see what's going on in my home 24/7.Logitech server. This is a tough one to explain, but I'll do my best. When you install the cameras and software, the alert system is dependent on Logitech's servers / service. In the month that I've been using the camera, I only had 1 time that their servers went down. In that time, the cameras in my home were recording as they should BUT the alert notification system will not work if Logitech's service is down or disrupted. Although it was only down for a few hours, I was still very unpleased given the fact that the alert system is what it's all about. I don't want to come home to find my house has been burglarized and didn't get a text because the servers were down. Instead, I want to get a text message telling me someone is there, that way I can call the police and increase my chances of getting the suspect while he is still in the residence. The alert service has only been disrupted once, but makes me nervous for what's to come down the road as these cameras begin to sell.Alerts. Again, read my Pros section about the alert function. Where I had a problem is how long it can take to get the alert text message. I've done some very extensive testing and it ranges between 40 seconds to 4 minutes from when my phone gets the alert text message. Now 4 minutes may not seem like a long time, but a skilled criminal can do A LOT in just a few minutes. I'm not too happy about the variations on alert times, especially since there appears to be no rhyme or reason as to why sometimes I get the notification in under a minute, but other times over 3 minutes. Clearly, it has to do with Logitech servers.Plug outlet requirements. Although I get why you have to plug in your unit to the actual wall, it doesn't mean I have to like it. It's been a little bit of a challenge with some of my cameras to find a good discreet location coupled with having an available outlet there. I'm guessing that at some point, Logitech will begin selling overpriced extension cords or power bars that allow the cameras to work even without being directly plugged into the wall. I believe a read few reviews from people that have done this though; I would live to get their reply or feedback in this review thread.Thanks for reading!", "Date": "November 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "The most hassle-free remote camera setup available", "Author": "James Beswick \"Thanks for your time\"", "ReviewID": "R254M5CEQQY7TD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been trying to set up a remote monitoring system for a while now, and have experimented with a few different solutions including webcams and other stand-alone cameras. The same problems problems occur over and over:- When the router gets rebooted, invariably you can't connect to the camera without going back and fixing some part of the configuration.- Remote viewing through dynamic IP addresses is flaky, and many DDNS solutions don't work very well. And do you really want a static IP address just for this?- You need a computer switched on near the camera, or a web-server that the camera can stream to. That's somewhat awkward.- The image quality is so-so, and tends to be good enough to see a person entering a room, but hard to identify who it is.I'm pleased to say that the Logitech Alert system beats any of the others I've tried hands-down, and it's clearly designed with absolute simplicity in mind, together with the need to connect with the camera system remotely without a degree in network engineering.Everything is provided in the box, including various mounts, network cables and software. It took more time to individually unwrap each component than connect it together - the whole system was live in under 5 minutes. The software updates itself in seconds, and even setting up user accounts on their website took no time at all. In terms of positioning the camera, it's possible to place it on a stand, screwed to a wall, or attached to a window using the suction cup provided.This package does several things (very) well:- The software is extremely simple to use, yet offers some bells and whistles such as motion alerts by email, live recording and playback, and basic controls such as zoom. It's also written in English, and you'd be surprised how many other systems are not.- It handles Internet disconnection gracefully with an on-board SD card, and doesn't need any user action to help it 'remember' any IP settings.- Talking of IP settings, these are all under the hood so you can be blissfully unaware of how it works - which is such a major benefit that I'd buy this package for this alone.- Viewing remotely through a desktop browser in another location is as simple as visiting the website and logging in.- Viewing from a smartphone is even better. I used their free Android app, and the speed and quality surpassed my expectations.- The audio broadcast is very clear.- Adding additional cameras is straightforward, although you have to make sure your Internet bandwidth is capable of supporting the number of cameras you need.- You can switch off the LED lights that might give away the location of the unit - what a nice touch.But this package is NOT:- A completely wireless solution: the camera connects to an outlet unit and communicates to your router with another outlet unit. Although wiring is really minimal, there is always the one cable needed on the camera side.- A replacement for a multi-camera professional system - though it comes close, and for a fraction of the price might suffice for some commercial users.- A way to spy on your neighbor's license plates across the road - why would you anyway?Still, even with those caveats it's a remarkably good solution if you want to view a location remotely with a minimum of hassle.", "Date": "September 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Hands down better than Wilife", "Author": "Tim Carter", "ReviewID": "R1I5NA144P2VB1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I moved from the WiLife system to the Alert about 3 weeks ago and could not be happier. The enhancements and improvements make the system what I have been looking for. Video quality is much better and now you can zoom and pan without paying extra.

We will see how the system holds up over time.", "Date": "August 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great and reliable Logitech Alert system provides security and peace of mind", "Author": "I'm not an internet shopaholic - \"thebanker\"", "ReviewID": "R1QP8XZ69SM6Q3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have already purchased 2 indoor and 9 outdoor Logitech Alert cameras to keep an eye on the house. Created 2 site profiles (indoor and outdoor) to view the 11 cameras.  Since I was extremely pleased with the IR \"night vision\" capabilities of the outdoor camera, 3 of the outdoor cameras are installed indoors to capture things that may bump in the dark.  Only cautionary note - the Alert system will only support up to 6 cameras to a single site profile that is registered to a single computer designated to download the recordings from the microSD card located in the camera.  Did I say that one really does not need to have a computer to record the video?  The 2Gb microSD card in the camera will perform all the necessary recordings and once full, it will override on a FIFO (first in first out) basis.  You can also upgrade up to 16Gb of microSD card capacity for longer record times.  Turning on your computer will provide the convenience of online live viewing and at the same time, downloading the data in the microSD card to that computer.All the cameras are connected via 3 TrendNet PoE switches which have been tested to support up to 4 cameras with no drop in power or video quality. The Alert Commander software is still in its infancy (sufficient for me) and I am certain Logitech will provide improvements in the future including the ability to customize an alert schedule instead of a simple turn on/turn off mode.  The motion sensor is still being tested for its sensitivity and reliability but the ability to create zones of the viewing area is a nice touch.  Audio feature is also nice but not available with the iPhone/Android viewing.Love the ability to view over the web as well as with the Android app on my smartphone.  For longer viewing time over the web or on your mobile (Android, iPhone and soon to be released Blackberry), one can subscribed to the $79 annual fee.  Otherwise, one needs to click on the refresh button every 90 seconds to continue viewing remotely.  Both web access and smartphone access can view both my site profiles with a click of a button.  Very clear (not clear to view the license plate as advertised by Logitech) when using the Alert Commander software on the computer.Overall, very pleased with this out the door solution after researching multiple vendor surveillance websites as this solution takes advantage of my home's existing Ethernet network.", "Date": "September 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Security System with 1 Exception", "Author": "C. Smith \"Electronics Fan\"", "ReviewID": "RAM23KFOTGDL3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This system for the cost and ease of installation is one of the best out there. I moved up from the Wilife security system and this is worlds better. It is more reliable than the Wilife system, has a better picture, and your computer does not have to be running 24/7 to be able to view you cameras from the internet.I am not sure what the last reviewer is doing wrong, but I have had no issues installing, adjusting settings and viewing the cameras over the internet. I have not paid for the premium service nor do I intend to do so. That being said the one issue I have with this system is the software. It is sad to say but the software for the Wilife system worked heads and tails better than this. There is a plus side though. If you don't feel like paying $80 per year for additional functionality, mainly being able to watch recorded video playback, then you have a choice.After researching the web trying to find a better option I found a thread on Logitechs support site talking about a program called Blue Iris. This camera monitoring software is amazing. It gives you increased functionality like the ability to playback recorded video, watch recorded or live video from ANY web browser. The best part is that there is a 30 day free trial and if you like it there is a one time cost of $50.00. 30 dollars less than logitech offering and a one time fee not an annual charge.You can check out the thread here:[...]It may take a little effort to set it up but once it is done you will have once of the best security systems for the cost.", "Date": "November 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Still Improving, but some degradation too.", "Author": "Bruce Ostrout", "ReviewID": "R2VYG54CWV1ZNM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "UPDATE 4/25/13 Decided not to renew the $80/yr service since I couldnt justify the cost of the service since I only had to use the features it a few times a year which basically meant I was paying approximately $4/use which is exhorbitantly expensive especially considering the high initial investment into the system. I went back to my old system of remoting into my main computer to administer the cameras and unfortunately there has been little evolution in the poorly designed desktop software.Besides being ugly and not scaling its text and menus properly therefore if you are using this on a htpc and have text scaled at larger than small the software is less functional because you cant access a lot of the items. The one \"upgrade\" they added was scheduled alerts, which is a nice addition but unfortunately on this windows 7 box as of this past feb update the scheduler component is terribly broken. Cant assign to cameras and doesnt list the schedules you have made, so in effect you cant even toggle alerts to individual cameras.Scheduled alerts is nice but should be a subset of more basic functionality that this system lacks which is separate motion zones for recording and separate for alerts. I would imagine the most common scenario is someone has a camera capturing the front of the house and would want the camera to record anything that occurs on camera for more than 10 seconds but doenst necessarily want to get an email alert. But if someone comes up the driveway aor approaches the house, they would want to mark that zone for an alert to their email as most likely that is activity they want to know about. For example... They want to record every car that comes down the street but be alerted only when one enters their driveway.Currently if you want to record all activity then you will get an alert for every recording therefore you literally end up with THOUSANDS of extra unecessary emails a year. You do however have the option to only send one alert during a specified period of time. I have it set to no more than once every 15 min so I am not bombarded with emails, but this is actually worse because basically I get an email about every 15 mins of a movement event and miss all the other events for the next 15 mins for a total of 4 emails in an hour instead of getting around 360 emails an hour to catch the one important moment that an intruder may be entering my home. Even though there is a good 15-45 second delay in the system, on a gigabit network with a 50Mbs internet connection, so even if it properly alerted by the time you got it you're probably already being raped or killed...a superset of scheduled alerts should even be snoozed alerts. i.e. say you are going to be out front playing with the kids for an hour. You pull out your smartphone click the front camera and click the snooze dropdown and click 1 hour then you wont get emails for one hour and once expired the alert turns back on so you dont have to remember you turned it off.After those basic features then add scheduled alerts..... I just have to believe that for the few years this system has already been out that Logitech engineers just don't use their own products.So basically I feel like I spent $1500 for a 4 camera system, two that cant even see in the dark, and that it is really only an after the fact documentary system definitely not an effective ALERT, system. Also that Logitech is FALSE advertising because to take advantage of their advertised features you have to get the $80/yr service. With their service you can go to any previous recording and view it fairly quickly. The desktop system if you want to view a time from yesterday. you have to go to the timeline click on the timeframe and then the system has to download all of the footage from now all the way back to then, so if you have 4 cameras it literally takes hours if not a day till it downloads the small clip. To me that is almost negligent. Why not only download immediately the clip selected, the only way you can do it is use the $80/yr service.CURRENT RECOMMENDATION: only consider this system if you are ok with the additional $80/yr cost and potentially tens of thousands of emails you must get to be able to have full recording of movement events and alerts when someone is entering your most important zones. Until they separate alerts and recording zones this system should not be marketed as an Alert system.Update 2/2/12 for the past few days my email alerts are taking about 3 hours to deliver. Logitech has made several updates to software firmware and iPhone apps to \"increase performance\" which is great but performance has not improved and seems to just keep getting worse.Update 5/9/11Still happy with the system overall. There have been several updates (although I haven't noticed any features added, but assume functionality locally is improved)but I have noticed over the last month or two that the alert lag time has gotten quite a bit  longer. I used to get an alert as soon as a car was coming up the drive, where now the alert almost always comes many minutes after i.e. before if the UPS guy was walking up the drive you would get an alert and could catch him before he got back in the truck, now he'll be long gone. Alerts need to get faster as the system improves.... When I make CC purchases with my Paypal card I get an email alert before I have left the counter, literally within seconds of the swipe. This system should be faster especially if they are charging a premium price and especially if they charge a yearly subscription, maybe they could give premium priority to subscribers. i.e. If you are not a subscriber your alerts could be 1-5 minutes like it is now btu a subscribers traffic should be prioritized to guarantee a 30 sec or less response time..I'm running 2 cameras and might get another but am unsure of which one.. The low light sensitivity of the indoor cameras is not that great so basically they are good for 50% of 24 hours. The outdoor can definitely see awesome over 24 hours due to night vision but is bulky and often gets so hot you can barely handle it, whereas the indoor camera is compact, easy to mount and only gets slightly warm.So overall I'm still happy and plan to expand but I get a bit of a sinking feeling as the live performance and alerts begin to get more laggy since it is tied to the logitech's online service for functionality and lthough it seems like Logitech is supporting the system with firmware and software updates I feel like they have a history of abandoning their premium quality/priced products too early. Come on Logitech exceed our expectations!Update 1/8/11Continues to improve as logitech continues to update the firmware. Many of my issues still exist but I still am irritated by the lack of remote alert control. When checking out the upgrade I see it has the ability to hard toggle alerts globally, which made me consider buying it, but when you drill through to the purchase page the info along the way is scarce at best. The item lists remote commander as a product purchase but nowhere along the way does it tell you if it is a 1 time purchase or a subscription. a 1 time purchase for $80 to get the ability to remotely toggle annoying alerts is expensive, per year is exhorbitant, not listing it as a reoccuring subscription is absurd at best. For a premium product the text/email alert logic should be more robust in the included comander then i could iTeleport/remote access easily on the iPhone to change the settings. I have to drop my rating until the info is listed more clearly that the upgrade is a one time purchase or subscription.Update 10/27I must say historically I have loved Logitech products but felt they were a company who put out products close to cuting edge but would abandon them not long after release.  So far after the first month the Alert team has put out several software and firmware updates. Now I have ben able to connect through the iphone to remotely view, quickly with no errors.I am close to pulling the trigger on several add on cameras but am still a litle hesitant. Things I want to see fixed or added:The PC interface does not scale. I use it on my HTPC and Windows 7 allows you to make text more readable for this type of setup. With the text larger it causes many of the option dialogs unable to be accessed because no scrollbar or window sizing is available, so that is a UI design flaw.You should be able to prioritize bandwidth (like google's free picasa does) where you can check a box to say conserve bandwidth, so when files are transferring they take a lower priority. Wehn the commander software first comes up it automatically transfers all the videos since last launched, or if active. This eats up your badwidth so all of your primary badwidth on the network like video streaming/recording or transfers become choppy or slow until the videos complete transfer, where you should be able to easily prioritize that.The iphone/remote interface needs to have an alert snooze button for the times you are workin in the yard or you know there is known activity that you dont mind being recorded but you dont want 1,000 emails flooding your inbox to needlessly alert you. Just click snooze and a preset interval 5min, 1 min, 30 etc etcFeature that would be nice to have:Alert zones and record zones. I should be able to easily set rules that i can select zones that I dont mind recording. Scenario: Record activity like my yard and my neighbors yard, or any motion at all in the neighborhood, but only be alerted to my zone that I mark as my driveway or better yet if my zone gets triggred then email me and my wife and if my neighbors is triggered email to their email....SO far I can definitely recommend this product for overall quality and ease of installation a hearty recoomendation remains to be seen but with Amazons awesome return policy it is definitely worth a try.OLD ReviewWas definitely easy to set up. Camera quality is decent but definitely not a good quality HD no way you'd be able to read a license plate. The Software looks to be the wilife software and not as robust as it should be for a company as big as Logitech who has had this type of product for years. The alerts and motion detection should have rules and more flexibility. When you log in from the remote apps you should be able to turn alerts on or off for each account and camera. Motion detection is sketchy and connecting to live view remotely often gives a C5-3 error. Support has said that the initial setups have strained the system causing the errors but this is a terrible excuse. a security system should always have 0 downtime. Murphy's law says that the events you need recorded will happen during a malfunction or server downtime and there are too many motion detection misses and inability to remote view that the percentage is high. You'll get 10 alerts in an hour where nothing passes through your detect zone and then your kids walk by or the UPS guy walks by and no recording because the motion detect didn't work. This should be fault proof. An innovative company like logitech really needs to have a product like this with truly impressive advancements.....", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Looks great - and NOW WORKS GREAT", "Author": "T.

I have been looking for a good indoor network camera for a while.  When you receive the package and pull it from its Amazon protective stuffing, you will see that Logitech spared no expense in designing the device and accessories.  The setup and software are easy to configure and the camera was up and running in 8 minutes.The picture was very, very good.  I was impressed with the amount of flexibility in the control and the overall thoughfulness that went into the design.Here is where the problems begin... unfortunately, the camera would lose its connection to the network after about 10-15 minutes continuously.  This could have been a defect with the camera itself but in the past, I have had similar issues with other logitech products.About a week or so ago, I receive an e-mail from Logitech that they had updated their software to correct reliability problems.

So when I saw the great reviews for this product, I assumed this was another great Logitech product.  But unfortunately I was mistaken.Got the package on time, and I was eager to set it up.  I'm an IT professional and my house is like a smaller version of Best Buy.  So I'm very comfortable with technology.  The INITIAL set up was easy and I thought, \"Holy cow, that was crazy-simple!!\"  However, after using it for a few months, I'd rather say it's waste of money.  Because the only time it really works is when I use the Commander software from within my network.  The moment I step away, nothing works (over the internet).  So trying to keep an eye on my house from outside is impossible.  My first conclusion was the network router - perhaps it was blocking traffic.  So I tweaked away at settings, but nothing worked.  I called support and it took them a few days to get back to me.  From there it progressively got worse.  Their tech guys just don't get it.  There's no good guide/documentation anywhere on how to fix this issue.  Nor does Support offer any real help.[See updated statment about support below]I'm really bummed about this.  The ONLY way I've managed to get past the internet issue is if I buy the Web Commander (trial).  So essentially I have to pay extra for this thing to even work like it's supposed to.  After my trial period expired, I figured \"what the heck, might as well lose more money on this crap\", and tried to buy the web commander.  But alas, that doesn't work either!!  Their purchasing webpage times out (for any computer, anywhere) and I'm now stuck.  I'll try again in a few days, but this really sucks.  It baffles me how a large company like Logitech can screw up so big on this product.I'm not sure if they've just washed their hands off this product line, but my overall experience with the product has been terrible. Oh, and the webpages won't even load correctly!!  This is insane.If you're in the market for something that actually works well, consistently, try something else.  That's my humble suggestion.Good luck with your search.[UPDATE]  I got to Tier2+ support and they've tried to help me through this process.  I take back what I said about bad support... looks like they're genuinely trying to help.

Harley", "ReviewID": "R7V7URSVAK3H2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a quick setup wireless surveillance kit.  It's literally ready to go minutes after unpacking.  Part of the ease of installation is because it uses home power lines as the network lines.  I've never been a fan of power line networking, and I'm not crazy about plugging a device directly from the wall into expensive router.  Logitech says the main network adapter has a built-in surge suppressor, but I'd at least like to know the Joules rating.  The cameras (indoor and outdoor) operate the same as the main unit.  Power lines serve as power and networking lines.  Setup was super easy.  You install the software on a PC first.  During installation you are prompted to install network adapter and cameras.  Installation of the main network adapter consists of plugging it into a wall outlet and connecting the color-coded Ethernet cord to a router or switch.  To install the camera, plug the transmitter into a wall outlet and connect it to the camera via a color coded powered Ethernet cable.  I did run into one small snag that was easily rectified.  I originally plugged the camera into a switched wall outlet so I could easily flick the camera off/on when leaving and arriving home.  The software did not detect the camera while plugged in that outlet.  I relocated the camera to an non-switched outlet and the software finally found the camera. So the power line networking appears to be VERY finicky.  That's why they advise not to use surge suppressors or any other device that may interfere with the signal.  Video quality and clarity is very good.  I honestly was expecting grainy web-cam quality video, however video is vivid, sharp with just a tiny bit of motion lag.  The cameras also have sound recording capability.  The motion detector is a little too sensitive out of the box, at least for my preference.  It would trigger a motion alert even when air from a register caused a plant leaf to move the tiniest bit.  Thankfully, motion sensitivity can be adjusted. You can also have the system send alerts to your email whenever motion is detected.  Alerts can be text only or include snap shots.  You can configure multiple alerts for different email addresses. You can also control the display of the LED indicator lights on the cameras.  You can also lock down cameras on the LAN with a security key.Low light performance wasn't that great, however, there is a low-light all-weather camera with night vision available as an additional cost option.  The all-weather  camera is heavy and solidly built.  It is definitely intended to be used primarily outdoors.  However, for a \"weatherproof\" camera, the instructions dedicate ample space to instructing users not to install the camera where it will be exposed to direct sunlight.  While direct sunlight is easily enough avoided for me, it may not be for some people.  Sunlight has to be taken into consideration along with the other elements for outdoor products.  The network/power connection is sealed with a rubber bezel.  As long as the camera doesn't get completely soaked, it should protect adequately.  I do wonder about water seepage during severe rain storms or snow/ice.  I guess only time will tell.  The biggest obstacle for most do-it-yourself types will be the power supply requirement.  The shape of the included Ethernet/power cable helps to form the weatherproof seal.  So far, it's holding up okay. However, the cable may not be long enough if there is significant distance between where the camera is mounted and a power source.  The dimensions and design of the weatherproof entry point for the Ethernet cable makes me believe an ordinary Ethernet cable may be too large and round.  The included cable is flat and rectangular.  Once in place, it contributes to the weatherproof seal.  The quick start guide suggests plugging the camera into an outside outlet.  I'm sure that outlet would be the first target for even the dumbest of intruders, especially if it's at ground level like most are.  At least a high hanging camera poses a bigger challenge to disable.  You just have to find a close enough power source to accommodate this.  Performance is on par with the indoor camera.  The best feature of the camera is night vision.  As I said earlier, low light performance is lacking on the regular indoor camera, however, this add-on camera solves that issue with infrared.Recorded video is captured on a micro SD card and you have the option to capture to a different storage source as well.  For instance, I pointed mine to a home NAS unit that's always on.  This way, I don't have to leave a PC running all day for storage.  Video is recorded in MP4 format. The cameras come with pre-installed 2GB micro-SD cards and adapters that allow them to be read in any SD card reader.  You can upgrade the size of the SD card if you wish.  Judging by the size of my video clips, you should get about 48 hrs of continuous video on a 2GB card. Logitech claims a week but that's based on the average amount of motion triggered video, not continuous nonstop recording.  If video is being saved to card only and the card runs out of space, the oldest recordings will be overwritten first.  If you don't plan to store footage to another larger external source, you should probably plan to upgrade to a higher capacity micro SD card.  8-16 GB seems to be the sweet spot.  I doubt most people need to store more than a week worth of video clips.Web access worked fine after creating an online account.  The Alert Commander software enables you to view real-time video from the cameras remotely over the web.  Logitech also offers their Alert Mobile Commander software for an additional yearly fee. Basically, the differences are:1) Alert Commander (Free):  Included with product.  Gives free basic view-only access to live footage via web or free smart-phone app.2) Alert Mobile Commander (Paid):  Optional, provides free web and smart phone app viewing plus remote configuration & viewing options, and ability to view pre-recorded footage.I am able to access the free Alert Commander on my Android smart-phone in my mobile browser without an app.  However, the on-screen keyboard doesn't work and I'm unable to access any settings at all.  I then downloaded the free Alert viewer from the Android market.  The app interface is more intuitive and easier to navigate than when accessing Alert from the browser on my Android phone.  However, it is still view only.  I tried accessing Alert commander from my iPad's browser too, but was unsuccessful.  Whenever I tried, I was immediately re-directed to a page stating the login is forbidden.  This appears to be caused by the lack of Flash support in iOS devices.  Fortunately, you can download a free universal iPhone/iPad app as well.  I plan to do so because I'd much rather monitor from my larger iPad screen when on the go.  Honestly, for what it offers,  Logitech should include Alert Mobile Commander free. You don't need it to view live feeds.  You just can't access pre-recorded footage or change any options.  Since pre-recorded footage is about the only thing I'd really miss, I already created a work around.  I have remote access to my NAS, so I simply view the saved video clips.  It's a little more cumbersome (the rare times when I need it) but saves me some loot!The Logitech 750i (and optional 700e) is a decent performing and quickly configured surveillance kit.  If you have an immediate surveillance need and want the easiest setup possible, this is the ticket.  Unfortunately, that ease of setup also makes it relatively easy to defeat if it is detected before recording starts or the intruder approaches the camera from behind.  It's much better suited for functioning as a known monitoring cam versus a discreet surveillance camera.  The bulky power bricks, limited length cords, and easily defeated nature prevents this from being a serious DVR system.  Given the fact that video is stored on a card within the camera (and can easily be removed or entire camera taken) and disabling the camera is as simple as snipping the line, evidence can easily be destroyed.  You likely won't be using this for forensic video after a crime (unless you have one really dumb criminal), but it's great for monitoring the house from afar for piece of mind, pets, children, nannies, etc.", "Date": "February 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Security is now fun", "Author": "M.

It included the inline Ethernet adapters so all you had to do was plug one into a wall socket near your router, plug it into the router, plug to other adapter into a wall socket near where you would want surveillance, then plug the camera in. And that's basically all the set up that is needed.Then you have to install the desktop software, it'll search for your camera(s) on the network, and you'll be able to see what's going on. The camera itself is of very good quality. The picture quality is great, and the field of view is very wide (you might need less cameras than you originally thought cause it's so wide). The camera comes with a microSD card preinstalled so you don't have to save video to your computer if you don't want. It even comes with a MicroSD card adapter! Which was very nice of Logitech to include.Everything was extremely easy to set up and I will probably be purchasing one or two more cameras in the future. My one complaint is that the camera that came with my master control system stopped working only minutes after I got it running (however I think that it was my fault because I unplugged the Ethernet cord while it was loading new firmware or something). But I still give this product 5 stars because when I contacted their customer service the lady I spoke with was very nice and helpful, plus she was American and I could understand her!

Within hours I had a personal call from the product director (sweet!) of their security systems, who left me both his direct line and cell phone.  He explained to me what happened and helped me resolve my issues - they even submitted an update to the Android app that fixed my problem.Overall I'm very pleased with how seriously they took it.A quick piece of advice for android users:  the Logitech Alert app is available for direct download from Logitech.  Do -not- get it from them. Instead search for \"logitech\" in the marketplace, and you'll find it.  As I'm writing this review, the marketplace has the latest version of the app, and Logitech's website has a broken, out of date one.Logitech also just released a firmware update to the cameras, which allegedly improves connectivity.

That user should have just done his research and figured out before buying that it didn't do what he needed. Logitech's website listed all the specs and what apps were available and on what.

Dean \"John\"", "ReviewID": "R7H7HSRFDW14", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I spent a few weeks looking around at all the various products like this, trying to find the right solution for my home needs.  I ended up on this one because of the reviews, in part, and the features, which covered the things I needed.  Specifically I wanted the ability to watch from any of my PC's, macs, or iphone and ipad at home (IT director so I have a lot of technology at my house) as well as when I was remote.  And I didn't want to have to pay a subscription fee for some \"service\".  Easy enough for me with my static IP to open ports in my firewall and redirect things myself if I need to, so I won't pay someone a yearly service fee to do the same thing.The ethernet over power adapters for these things are huge, bigger than the camera itself.  The only positive thing about them is that the plug really extends a bit, so it actually could fit where another way smaller power brick I had would not, because this one with the power plugged in, the rest of the unit itself was not flush against the wall, but had some space between it and the wall even when plugged in.The camera itself is a decent enough size, not something you'll get stealth surveillance with, but at least manageable.  But the problem I found is that the supplied options for mounting it are VERY limited.  The only holes to secure it with are in the front and back of the unit, and the mounting options they give you really don't allow for much flexibility.  Even trying to mount on my nice tripod I have for my camera and camcorder was problematic, since the only way it worked was to screw the tripod directly into the back of the camera.  The attachments they have to mount it use a different screw thread, so I couldn't use any of them in between the camera and tripod to give me a little more wiggle room for positioning.On the plus side, it was very simple to set up.  Plug in the first ethernet over power adapter into your router and a wall outlet (no UPS or surge suppressors since that filters the signal and they won't communicate, you have to plug directly into the wall on both ends), then plug the other one into the wall and your camera, and install the software.Software actually worked well, found the cameras right away, and right away informed me that there were firmware updates for both the ethernet over power adapters as well as the camera, and updated them all seamlessly.  However, I kept getting a nag from the software that it couldn't check for an update for the software itself because there was no internet connection, and it's nagging me about this while it's downloading the camera and adapter updates from the internet...  I did manually find the download from Logitech's website to update the software, and that helped on the one machine to keep that from popping up again, but the same thing on a second PC, even with the updated version installed, it still kept nagging me that it could not find the internet.Once up and running, I set up a free online account at Logitech for this, and then could use a web browser from anywhere to view.  I also was then able to download their free iPhone app and view it from the iPhone.Now is where the disappointments start piling up.  The control software evidently can only be ran from one PC, which is really a poor option for me since I have several PC's and macs in the house, and would like to be able to view the \"good\" higher framerate nearly live stream from any of them I wanted to.  But only one and only a PC.  There is no way to directly get to the camera from your web browser internally.  If you use just a web browser or the iphone app, everything is delayed and the framerate is a fraction of what you get using the software directly on your network, so you can't get the higher speed view from anything other than the one PC that you install the software on.  Everything else has to go out to Logitech and then back INTO the same network you're sitting on.  Induces a lot of lag even on a 5MBps internet connection, and of course the low frame rate...  I want a system that any device internally can access directly and get a good view from, and this product does not offer that ability.The picture was good though, and the software's options for adjusting the field of view, zoom, and even digitally panning and tilting worked surprisingly well.  These are the features that, if you don't pay for a yearly service fee, you can only do from the PC you installed the software.  Evidently though if you pay the $80 yearly fee you can also do those adjustments from remote viewing areas.  I didn't need that adjustment from outside the home though, so the viewing was all I was concerned about having.  So I installed the app on my iPhone and it worked fine.Then an hour or so later, the iphone won't connect at all to the cameras.  I can log into my account with it, I can see the camera as my option to choose, and nothing at all.  No view, nada.  Reset camera and the adapter plugging the system into my router, and it views from the software just fine but nothing remote worked again.And as others have stated, there is NO low light or night vision at all, which logitech clearly states.  But it goes even worse than that, since I had expected at least some similar vision to what we get visually ourselves, but even in light where I could still see fairly well, the unit's light gathering is almost null.  So long before it's really dark out, the camera becomes useless and shows just a black screen.So between the lack of stability from anything other than the single PC you can install the software on, and the fact that you can only stream the better, higher framerate from a single \"master\" PC rather than from anything at all inside the same network, and the failure after an hour of being able to connect to it \"remotely\" anymore, I'm disappointed.  And have set up the return and will try another product now.Edit added 5/4/11:Got an email, unsolicited, from the product quality assurance manager for the alert system at Logitech, who had read my review.  Very friendly and wishing he had been able to get hold of me before I returned the unit to try some things I hadn't, as well as the explanation of the low light threshold of the unit, and suggestions for improving it somewhat with manual brightness and contrast setting changes.  The fact that they reached out to touch me after the return is a nice testament, since more and more companies you can't get a response from even when you still have the product and are trying to get their support to work with you.  I'm currently on my third model of a security camera, and even this third company's unit has been nothing but problems...  But so far of the three, Logitech is the only one who responded, and that was even without me emailing them first, whereas I've got questions out to the other two that have so far been ignored...

Jentsch", "ReviewID": "R3ASLQ1HZ2PE2T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After having quite a bit of time to try out this camera and the Logitech Alert 700e Outdoor Add-On Security Camera with Night Vision camera, I think I finally have enough experience with it to write a reasonable review.Just like the best camera is the one you have with you when you need it, the best security system is the one that you can actually use. If something is too complex, or is unreliable, it's not worth any money and just ends up wasting your time. Logitech got it right in this situation, as the Alert system was never difficult to use, and always worked for me.The cameras work on powerline transmission networking technology, so the camera is connected to a wall wart via an ethernet-style cable, which provides both power and data connections. As such, they cannot be considered wireless, but they do not require a dedicated ethernet connection to your local network as well as a power connection. It does mean, however, that there needs to be another powerline wall wart that connects to your router/switch to complete the network connection. Both cameras I used were able to connect with a single \"receiver\" wall wart.Setting up the cameras and the Logitech software was very easy. Updates from Logitech to the software, to the wall warts, and to the cameras, were all done automatically and without incident. I would equate the ease of use to this point to installing a computer mouse; it's that easy.These cameras are built very well. The indoor camera can mount to a window with a suction cup, and it let loose on me a few times because the window wasn't as clean as it could/should have been. That's a common issue with suction cups that don't have a lever actuator, and I don't fault the product at all. Once I cleaned the window and got a good suction connection, it never came loose. Until then, the camera did take a few falls from about five feet to a vinyl floor, but no damage was sustained, which is an indicator to the build quality of the camera. I also like the mounting options of the suction cup on the front, on the back, and a small stand if you want to put the camera on a shelf or counter. It's likely that the screw mount socket would accept additional mounting equipment, but I didn't try.Video quality on the cameras was very good. They didn't suffer from blown-out bright areas, and even in darkened rooms, the video was still very watchable. I didn't try out much of the night vision features of the outdoor camera, but once I do, I'll most likely write some comments in a review of that item.The Logitech software was easy to use and I never ran into a situation where I didn't understand how to do something or that the software failed to perform its tasks. When cameras were unplugged, the display showed their status accurately, and when they were reconnected, they were found in a reasonable amount of time, and the software went on its merry way in recording things the way it was set up to do for that camera.It was very easy to go back in time through the recordings and see when activity was recorded via the timeline which showed when video was recorded. I used the two cameras to monitor some construction on our home, and it was very easy to see the progress and the work being done. When I had to leave for a meeting, I turned one of the cameras into the house, so I could see if anyone was letting themselves into the house when they shouldn't have been. By setting the motion sensor areas and then seeing that no motion was detected while I was gone, I could verify my trust in the workers.Accessing the camera feeds from an iPhone and iPad worked as advertised. There is a delay of several seconds between live action and what appears on the feed, but that's understandable considering that the connection is happening across the Internet and not the local network. It was very handy to pull up the video feeds during the construction project when I had to be away to see how things were going and where they were at in the process.As far as advertised features and ease of use, the Logitech Alert system performed on all counts. I found no problems while using any of the features. I did not try out the subscription service which provided for online camera control.That said, there were some features that I expected but were not available. I would have liked the ability to configure the software to send still images to a remote ftp or web server on a scheduled basis. This is a fairly common need in a situation where you want to set up a web cam feed for a web site, and it was disappointing that such a feature wasn't available.I would also like to have been able to see the video feed from the cameras from another PC on the network that was not the PC doing the recording. It would have been nice for the cameras to be accessible via an IP address or for the software on the recording PC to have some video feed ability to another PC on the local network.Lacking that, it is possible to access the feeds via the iPhone/iPad app, but it seems less than logical to have to have an app access the Logitech server, which is accessing the local recording PC, to transmit the video from the camera on the same local network. Keeping it on the local network would allow for real-time video feeds, but perhaps that would not be possible and still keep the software as simple as it is.I've read some reviews that other software can access the Logitech Alert cameras, so perhaps my wish list is taken care of by third-party software. I'll have to look into that.Ignoring my desire to always have better than what is provided, the Logitech Alert system is very easy to use, it performs well, and it doesn't overwhelm the user with complexity that could result in the system not being used at all. The best security system is the one that is used and that is usable, and I think that the Logitech Alert system qualifies in that category.It's not as full-featured as I would like, but I think most average users would be happy with what it does offer by default.

I didn't understand all of the settings until after I played with them a bit, I could see the impact of changing any of the settings.  I did make a call to Logitech Support prior to buying the system (Outdoor) and the support person indicated that some folks with a big house or one that has been added on to have more that one \"circuit breaker box\".  If the camera's electrical power cord is connected to a box that is different from the one that powers the internet connector box, that connector box may not see the camera.  That info does NOT appear in any documentation.  The documentation does not tell you about the testing/diagnostic section where you can see the signal strength from the cameras to the connector box.

I tested the system before going on a two week trip and it appeared to be working fine.  After attempting to use the system during and after my two week absence I can only assume that this product was not fully tested by Logitech and released too early.  My experiences, broken down by product components, were as follows:1. Base station software: While camera set up and initialization is very easy and viewing cameras in live mode works great the most important feature - playback mode -simply does not work. Videos written to the cameras SD card do not show up in the history window thus no accurate history can be ascertained without removing the camera's SD card and reviewing each video file (which is very tedious).2. Cameras: This is clearly the weakest link in the product line.  I had multiple problems including:  - Cameras going off line (I have no idea why). I had to ask a relative to come to house to unplug and plug in again to reestablish a connection.  - One camera simply stopped recording any images thus it was only useful in live mode.  - Very inconsistent motion detection/image capture. Activity I observed in live mode was not detected or recorded.  I am fully aware of all the configuration parameters that affect this feature (motion detection zone, time of motion etc.). It simply did not work consistently.3. Mobile Commander:  I am regretting paying the yearly subscription fee as this component. The live view mode repeatedly failed to recognize cameras.  The play back function repeatedly displays nothing but error messages and there is very little you can do to correct any camera anomalies.  I would suggest just staying with the free version.This product line has the potential to be an effective security tool.

The camera lives up to its claim, so perhaps my criticisms are unfair.  But I've found the camera to essentially be useless without the infrared recording features that the outdoor models have.  Seems like every reason I've had to review captured footage has resulted in...  well, no footage.  Not enough light, so the camera is blind.I've had a few issues with the system failing to \"find\" the cameras...

WIth on-going costs of running this system essentially being $0 (live viewing of the cameras online through Logitech's servers and optionally emailed snapshots of motion-triggered recordings are FREE), that's a maintenance cost I can live with.  I do pay a minimal monthly fee ($5/mo) for a third-party cloud backup that runs every minute, so if a security \"incident\" results in the loss of my memory cards and the PC the footage lives on, I should have record of how it happened with an off-site backup.I'm happy with the system overall, though I really wish Logitech would expand it to offer functionality to Mac users (I bought a Windows-based laptop just to run the Alert system).

The big live screen window has a tendency to lock or freeze but the small screen on the below right of the window doesn't.2. Sometimes the system will not update the recording in the computer although it's been recorded in the micro sd in the camera. This is a cause for concern because I had it set up to record in my network drive so that I can browse it anytime, anywhere. And I will receive an alert via email but won't be able to see it because the system hasn't updated the recording yet in my network drive. In both cases (1&2) you have to physically close and open up the logitech commander.Logitech need to look into these issues and release firmwares to rectify these flaws.PROS. set up is so easy and straight forward. picture quality is outstanding when compared to other camera surveillance system. you can draw area/s on the actual image to trigger motion detection that eliminates unwanted areas for recording falsely.. built in dvr with a microsd card slot for recording in the camera, in that way if your pc is turned off it still records clips. but if, god forbids, an intruder in your house grabbed an removed all the cameras then you will end up with no recording evidence. i suggest you dedicate a pc for the surveillance system that you can keep on all the time. and if you have a cloud service you can have the clips automatically backed up in your cloud and access it anywhere you want when you're away from home. so even if the intruder grabs all the cameras and pc in your home, you have the recording evidence stored in your cloud. plus you will be notified with an email alert that motion was detected.. great iphone app and website monitoring (for full function you have to subscribe)CONS. night vision mode is quite a bit of a disappointment but still way much better than the competition. but if you have a motion triggered light or lights on, picture quality is good.. no way to edit/delete clips in the camera's micro sd remotely from the pc. you can only format the card remotely and then edit the clips saved on your pc.. it seems like the headlight from the car driving at night triggers the recording. i've had a lot of night recordings nothing but cars driving by. the automatic transferring/recording of clips from the camera's sd card to the pc is not instantly and delayed (but maybe because of the home network system). no way to delay or set it on/off remotely(like the alarm security system). so if you are leaving the house it will record your every movement if you happen to run across one.. limited up to only 6 cameras (but you wouldn't use that many for a home security unless you live in a palace)overall, this is a great system even though it comes with a hefty price tag in comparison with other surveillance systems. but it's worth the money!", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Easy to install & great value for price", "Author": "T.

The software update took longer than the set up. Once the update finished and I started to hook things up it only took 5 minutes. I spent more time adjusting the camera angle but that was really easy using my smart phone to check the image. The ability to zoom in/out is terrific. I was able to get both the front door and rear sliding door on one camera so it worked out perfectly for me.The software is very easy to use and very intuitive. I am impressed with the number of options i.e. setting commands per camera. For the alerts it appears they are always on, unless I missed a setting. I would recommend a time of day feature so you can set it to provide email alerts only during certain times, like at work etc. Again, it may do that but I did not see that functionality during setup.The only complaints I have are more nuisance than material. They say not to plug your router module to a surge protector. I plugged this into my wireless router (which works sweet) and of course, I have everything on surge protectors/battery backup systems so had to re-arrange the plugs. The other complaint is the video cords could be longer. They are about 10-12 feet long so if you are going to run one quite a ways I would recommend getting a longer cord or extensions.

The best feature is you can play the recorded video anywhere you have internet (you don't have to wait until you get home as with the D-Link).I wish Logitech would put infrared in the indoor cameras. For this reason, I recommend that you buy all outdoor cameras to take advantage of the infrared light.

I expect required, however I have this mounted on the inside of the window facing out, so in lower light the red light reflects off the glass (I know this camera does not have night vision but it faces outside to a lit patio).  Easily solved however.-After motion is detected then the recording starts not capturing the first several seconds.  It may take a couple seconds to sense motion but the recording doesnt go back \"retroactive\" to the start of the motion.  While I expect that would require some type of memory buffer, it would help to see what triggered the motion (ie a animal or bird) as well as record an additional couple seconds of any real security event.-requirement to pay for the full remote service.  the free service only allows you to see current streaming and not recorded video.

I did get 2 shots before they unplugged it, one of which was of the guy unplugging the camerathus disabling it for any further photos; that one was really blurry..  I tried again a few days later by positioning the camera in a new and less visible spot, because it became clear that I did not have one-time intruders but actually people that had broken into my attic and were living there.  The second time, they just stole the SD card out of the unit.  No card, no photos.  Unless you happen to be viewing the video at the time the break-in occurs (I wasn't), you won't have anything to show for it with the SD card gone.  No point in putting the camera out anymore.

So I am happy to report that with the Logitech Alert 750i we have a simple to install, relatively easy to use indoor security system. The camera image is quite good, though in low light you will discover that facial features are difficult to ascertain. The included software, which I thought easy to install, worked quite well right from the start.I am fortunate in that the necessary power outlet, used to transmit the camera image, is easily accessible to my home network. This is a possible problem area so make sure you have the requisite power outlet within easy access to your computer/computer network. The internal 2 gig mini-SD card records 6 to 7 days of video which is more than sufficient for most needs.

I looked through the online documentation which was useless. I eventually found that my router (D-link DIR 655) had a setting for multimedia data which was turned off. After changing that I had no problems finding the cameras during testing. I would have thought the documentation for the camera would have something about checking router settings as D-Link is a pretty common router brand.I really like the software but it has quirks too. You can't maximize the program window and see all camera views together. You only get a large image of one camera not the collage of all cameras you see in the smaller window. Also you can't see any live images when remote connecting to the computer. You can't see recorded video either unless you pull up the video files directly. The web connect works well for live images but you can't get recorded video unless you pay the annual fee.

After just receiving it and hooking it up, I have been pleasantly surprised that the negative reviews I've read have been overblown for the most part, and the positives have been more or less accurate.The one negative review that I read, and that I have realized was very accurate, was that the indoor camera does seem quite worthless unless your house has at least one light on in a room at any given time.  The indoor camera is shockingly functional with even a dim lamp, but worthless at night when it's 100% dark.  In my opinion, not even small enough to justify buying it to not be detected.  Read on...The coolest part of this system by far (and I sorely wish that I had ordered two of these instead of the indoor camera) is the outdoor camera.  I could not get enough fun out of the night vision last night in my house and how clear the black and white image really is.  I took my laptop to bed and had the software up and running just to see what was going on in my empty kitchen at night whenever I wanted to (keep in mind m recent burglary).  I agree with several reviews that I have read saying to invest in only the outdoor cameras and to ignore the indoor ones and I agree 100%.  I am regretting even messing with the indoor version, but I doubt that I can return it as it was a part of a master system, so I will just find an effective use for it!Overall, this system was easy to use, though to save time I would suggest downloading the software installer from Logitech's website rather than from the CD in the package because there are a ton of updates to the product since the CD version came out.  My biggest complaints are Logitech's struggles to clearly define why I should spend $80 per year for the premium software vs. using the free live feed viewer that comes with the \"Master System.\"  Unless Logitech was saving videos from my cameras when my computer and I were away (for later viewing if a camera/memory card gets stolen by some jerk), then I don't understand the need to pay for the premium setup.  I am unclear if this is an option, and it is disappointing to me because the burglars who hit my house were serial burglars and they spent a lot of time to not miss an inch of stuff...the cameras would soon be spotted and stolen (along with the memory cards)!As far as ease of use, my grandma couldn't figure it out, but I'm 27 and it wasn't difficult at all.

This Logitech is exactly what I needed...sets up in mere minutes. Everything was included in the box - no need to run for this or that cable or some odd connection. If I had realized just how simple this would be, I would have installed it weeks ago.Installation consisted of1. Opening the box2. Loading the software3. Plugging in 2 cables4. Setting up the cameraThe software tested the connection to make sure it was properly received by the router and then tested for each of the camers (one inside and one outside). Mounting hardware and all requirements were included.Picture Quality is surprisingly decent both inside and outside of the house. There are ample controls that allow the user to zoom in/out, pan and make other adjustments from the computer. The entire control panel is intuitive and easy to use even for non-technical types. Color saturation is decent and just to provide a bit of perspective, I'm able to see a flying insect that keeps buzzing around the screen.Slight Lag  - as others have mentioned, there is a slight lag but it seems quite minimal. While setting up the camera angles we used walkie talkies and it appeared to be less than a second behind although it may vary by location/use other...I'm really not sure. However, there was a small lag but not incredibly significant.Wires - Yes, there are some wires to this system but far fewer than the other set we have had sitting in the closet for well over a year waiting to install. Comparatively, this is SO simple to set-up! Basically there is a wire that leads to the camera from an outlet but that's it...no need to re-wire the entire house just to put in an extra camera.Features - The features are just right...all the ones I wanted most and none of the ones I didn't. Pan/zoom, night vision, email/remote alerts, live viewing (already have caught my neighbor letting their dog do it's business in our yard TWICE today...and they've been claiming it's not them!), motion detection etc...Durability - Since I\"ve just installed this I cannot speak to the issue of durability yet however, both cameras seem well built. The outside unit is not totally sealed against all weather but is properly weatherproofed for outside use.Bottom line - A wonderful solution for the DIY homeowner that needs a bit of extra security when away from home or desires a way to perform live view. Installation is a breeze, nice set of features...I do with the price of the add-on cameras was lower as they seem high especially compared to other systems. I would personally be inclined to purchase more once the durability is tested a bit more and I have the confidence in knowing these will continue to work over the long run.

But not for me.  I have a modern home with good wiring, but since this system ONLY networks via electrical lines, it won't work for me. I had two cameras (one indoor and one outdoor) and both were very erratic - I'd lose the image for hours/days at a time, then it would come back.On Logitech's recommendation, I ran the diagnostics which showed that the \"powerline performance\" was inadequate. According to Logitech, it had to be over a value of 150. Mine ranged between 5 and 75. When on a separate electrical circuit, the performance was between 5 and 40. When the cameras were plugged into the same electrical circuit as the master (according to Logitech, they shouldn't be plugged into the same circuit as they can interfere with each other), the performance was betweeen 45 and 75. Never was it close to the minimum acceptable level of 150.The system has everything I could want - great image quality, decent night-vision IR, decent desk-top app, smart-phone connectivity, etc. The only thing I'd like to see them add (other than decent networking) is better user management - i.e., ability to have multiple user accounts and have the ability to limit users to one or more cameras (with or without admin rights).The software is pretty imature at this point - the motion detection isn't the best and when you \"pan/zoom\" (really move a virtual window within the full range of the camera's vision), it starts recording motion. The motion files run between 1.5 and 2.5 MB in size each and are stored on the camera's SD card as well as transfered to a base computer when connected. I suspect that the software will improve significantly over time, though.The system is supposed to send emails out when motion is detected, but that feature only worked about 10% of the time - out of about 40 motion files, I only got about 4 emails.Unfortunately, they went back to Amazon today - I really like the system, but the networking was just unacceptable, at least in my case.As a post-note, I had called Logitech support 4 or 5 times about the issues I was having and the support personnel had no recommendations for me. So, after dropping it off today to be sent back to Amazon, I got a call from Logitech and they want to try to troubleshoot the networking issue - I suspect I won't be the only person with this issue - and apparently, they suspect the same. I'll post results if/when I have them.bert---------------------------------------------------------------------------------post-note 1---------------------------------------------------------------------------------8/24/10 update - I spent some time on the phone with the development staff and they think the issue is my \"whole house surge protection\" system that's attached to my circuit breaker panel. Unfortunately, I can't just switch it off to find out if that's the issue, and am not sure I want to eliminate that from my house!  It's a dilemma.  But, if you're considering this system, you may want to make sure you don't have a whole-house surge protection system installed.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------post-note 2---------------------------------------------------------------------------------8/28/10 - As a follow-up, Logitech has been spending a lot of time with me to determine what the cause of my problem was. At this point, several facts have been determined:1) The whole-house surge protector didn't seem to affect the system.2) I have 3 UPS units on the circuit that the Logitech master bridge was plugged into. It appears that these UPS units had an adverse affect on the system.3) A remote Logitech camera was plugged into an outlet that also had a wireless internet camera plugged into it (Trendnet TV-IP410W). The Logitech system did not work well at all when this Trendnet camera was plugged into the same outlet as the Logitech camera. Apparently the wireless transmitter in the Trendnet camera had ill-affect on the Logitech camera.I have since moved the Logitech bridge (master unit) to an outlet in a different room, on a different circuit than the 3 UPS's and unplugged the Trendnet camera, and the system is now working fine.  MUCH credit goes to the Logitech people who have been fantastic in working with me to determine the cause of the problem.I can sincerely recommend this system - with the simple caveat that you may need to find the correct outlet(s) to use based on any equipment that may interfere with the networking of the master or camera units.bert", "Date": "August 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Misleading advertising... installation, motion and low light issues.", "Author": "Work of Life", "ReviewID": "R17G5Y8XJJQNWY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The marketing photos on the packaging would lead you to believe that there are no exposed wires on the cameras once this system is installed, but it is just slick marketing.

This is one of the dumbest suggestions for an outdoor security camera that I have ever seen and it is not revealed by any of the photos on the exterior of the packaging. We ultimately chose to install plug points in our attic and run the wire for the outdoor unit up into the attic (counter to Logitech instructions), but the only other alternative is to drill a hole through the nearest exterior wall and run the wire into your house to plug in.The indoor camera has *very* poor low light visibility and no \"night vision\" as the outdoor unit has. So if you are thinking of pointing one of the indoor cameras out a window to use for outdoor security, think again. It is completely useless in low light or darkness which makes it also ineffective at low light indoor security as well (unless you want to install motion lights in your house to accompany the camera).Lastly, the motion detection control is not very sensitive. Though it does give you a slider to tweak in the control software, it is misleading because motion is either *full on* (past the half way point on the slider) or completely off (before the halfway point).

Easy to follow instructions, when I arrived at the step to plug the unit in, the one plug powering the computer link was fine green light turned on.  The other power box I plugged in but did not get a green light.  I thought it was the wall plug, I tried another, and another it never worked.Logitec customer service was really good going through some trouble shooting.  They quickly came to the same conclusion that it was an inoperable plug (they offered to replace it but the time was 21 days).  The customer service I received was outstanding.  The product was broken but they were fast/helpful and friendly over the phone.  I called and got the person who could help me, I did not get turfed around to 4 different customer service people, which is common for some companies that have tech support, I don't beleive this is outsourced tech support and the call goes to an actual technician ready to help with any problem.If they had stars for customer service I would give them 5.The product would get only 1 since it did not work.My suggestion is test the power plugs prior to doing any set-up so you don't waste your time loading the program on your computer.

I was excited because we have set up a few DIY camera security systems around the home over the years and I was interested in how the experience would be with a professional system.  The biggest difference was the ease of setting it up.  The setup instructions are clear and easy to follow.  Basically you mount the cameras, connect them to their powerline network adapters, connect a similar network adapter to your router and install and set up the software.  There are a variety of mounting options for the cameras, so you shouldn't have trouble finding something that works for your situation.  The cable from the camera to the network adapter is very small and thin and can be passed through windows or be hidden fairly easily.  The network adapters must be plugged directly into the wall, not through surge protectors.  Using your existing power wiring for the networking really simplifies the installation.The indoor camera works great.  Great picture, good in low light situations.  The outdoor camera is fantastic.  Very solid construction, very powerful infrared illumination.  This camera gets a great picture even on a cloudy, no-moonlight night.  Both cameras come with a 2 GB memory card so that they can save video even when the PC software is not running.The software is version 3 and feels very mature.  Easy setup, intuitive, well thought out controls.  The first thing the software did was check to see if there was a newer version available and finding a newer version it downloaded and installed that.  Later on the system also noted the camera software and powerline network adapter software needed to be updated and did this all automatically also, except for needing to cycle the power on the powerline adapters after their update.  My biggest problem with the software portion of the system is that it is set up for viewing on a single, local computer.  We ended up installing it on the computer in the office rather than on our two laptops, which would have been much more convenient.  A very powerful feature is the ability to view the video from anywhere you have an Internet connection, including on your Android device or iPhone.  This feature gives you access to the live feeds for free.  If you want access to the video history or ability to configure your system remotely you need to pay the $79/year subscription.While it seems strange to say this, since we got the items for `free' through Vine, my biggest problem with the product is the price.  Retail you're looking at $300 + $280, plus $80/year for remote history viewing.  Perhaps the price factors in that the system is so easy to install that you won't have to pay for installation and maybe Logitech is targeting small business users.  Price aside, I whole-heartedly recommend this system.", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Nice System that Anyone can Install", "Author": "D.

This is truly a plug-n-play system that operates through your existing network and electrical system.

I thought the image quality was better than average, competing favorably with a system that my neighbor had installed for three times the price.  The record and review features are excellent and night vision quality and sound are very good as well.  What I like best is the option of using email and text alerts when the cameras pick up movement, along with the ability for live viewing from your cameras on the internet.

It was very easy to set up and in minutes I was viewing the outside of my home  on my computer screen. The software loads so simply and the camera view screen pops up right away. It is wireless as in the system uses your DSL/Cable system and the wiring in your home. Each camera does require an electrical outlet to work. The line to the camera is quite thin but with the type of replacement windows we have it will not allow them to close completely for the outside camera so we are working to set it inside and still get the backyard view we require.The one we have been using is the one that comes in this kit. It is angled toward the front door. I can see who is there at any time of the day or night. The picture is crystal clear. I just had a visit to the hospital and when I got home I reviewed the still shots the camera took when I was gone. You can do that without taking the card out of the computer. It comes with an SD card adapter for the mini card to fit right into the computer. Reviewing the week it holds is a snap.You also get 2 stickers warning that the home is being protected. The only thing you need to be careful of is not aiming it at your neighbors homes, there are local rules in most communities against spying in this manner. I was able to sit mine sideways in the front window so it captures only my front door. This also would make it harder to cover should someone try to cover it up with a paper.I think next I will next try setting it to watch what our dog does when we are gone. I have a good idea but it could be funny. Overall I would recommend this item. Posting your camera's may be a step to give possible vandals a second thought. You can log on the website from your phone if you have internet on the phone and check what is going on at home.

The outdoor camera is weather-proof and has the added capability of infrared night vision.  It can see in complete darkness--a very cool detail!  Both cameras were moved around to different locations for testing in and out of the house and both worked very well no matter where they were located.  When the camera was looking outside, nuisance alarms were caused by wind moving the trees.  This was easily fixed by using the mouse to select zones to watch for significant movement.  Image quality is very good and pan/zoom capability is nice.  The only things I didn't like were that both the indoor and outdoor cameras are corded, not cordless and the cameras are not tiny to be hid in a corner.

The units install easily and the only drawback on these units seem to be price. But so far at least you get what you pay for.PS : I will update in a couple months how this systems outside camera does in the cold new england winters..but so far so good.  Night vision is clear in close but limited 30 feet (not nearly as good as the uniden units 50++feet).  A small sacrifice though for the easy setup, clear control panel, and 64 bit support on this unit though.Update: The outside camera performed well this winter, with no issues.  It has been as cold as -4 deg here and we have had tons of snow.  I did have to clean the lens on the unit twice, due to blowing snow freezing to the front of it.Also I have found that the wireless part of the system can be tricky depending on the size of your house or how far on the circuit the unit is from the receiver. I found if the receiver and the camera are on different circuits and one of them is GFI protected, has dimmers, or has spiral type energy saving bulbs, you can have interference. The dimmers came into play with my living room when trying the camera in there; different circuit but same distance as the living room, and I had a fuzzy signal with the lights on.  The energy saving bulbs showed up when moving the camera to our porch area. We blew a bulb, replaced it with an energy saver and static in the signal., switched it back, problem solved.  We found the GFI when trying to place this in our laundry area, that is the only explanation we could find as distance,lighting, ect should not have been an issue.The UPDATED bottom line after 4 months.  The units work well and with some planning install easily.  It helps a great deal if your on the same circuit, and if you can limit distance traveled it will improve signal and easy of setup. Depending on your needs and budget this can be a good system.

Setting up took less than 15 minutes to figure it out.

We can see our driveway perfectly fine. It's excellent even at night. We have a light in the driveway so maybe that helps.

In general, the video quality of the camera is very good (as long as you have reasonably-good lightning).  Pretty strong fisheye effect from the very-wide-angle lens, so that takes some getting used-to.  I also discovered that the picture outside of the fisheye is prone to reflections from the glass (I'm using the suction-cup mount), so I taped a small piece of black construction paper (with a lens-sized hole cut in it) to the window, and placed the camera against that.Setup, in a Mac household running Vitamin D surveillance software, was a bit of a pain.  Had to fire up XP under VMware Fusion in order to configure the camera.  I put the camera's MAC address in my AirPort Extreme's DHCP reservation system, and was thus able to configure a \"static\" IP address for the camera.  I then pointed Vitamin D at that static IP, and it all kinda worked.

It's very light sensitive so it works well through dusk but not at night.

I went with this camera over the outdoor because I rent a house and didn't want to work out running a power line or drilling a hole to the front porch, instead I just stuck this to the front window.I used the suction cup for a day but then switched to the mounting arm which I attached to the window frame with picture hanging adhesive strips.The camera is very wide angle (120 degrees) so it sees more than you think it might which can actually be a problem if you want to use the camera as a theft deterrent, as a thief might think the camera can't see them. However there is a little blinking light the flashes when the camera detects motion and turns on and that is intimidating.The biggest downside of this camera is that the supposed Android app for it doesn't exist so if you are planning on using that, don't. I can't speak for the iphone or blackberry apps.Another downside is that the motion detector can be too sensitive, when it gets windy the trees set if off. It'd be cool if it could use a learning algorithm to figure out what you wanted recorded.The last downside I can think of is that it tends to split what should be one long recording into several smaller sections, this is only really an issue if you are trying to save them. It should have a threshold for this.My main wishes for the next version would be slightly higher resolution, the ability to save entire days and the ability to schedule recordings whether there is motion or not (for example to prove that a delivery driver wasn't there.)I'd also like to see a version with wi-fi just in case your power lines are too noisy for good transmission.My final suggestion is that I'd like to be able to tilt/swivel the camera on the suction cup mount.", "Date": "February 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good quality", "Author": "Merlin", "ReviewID": "R3GZVXEUGSO5FC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the in-door camera first.

This is not a full product review; it's just a summary of some good and bad points that I have found.Overall I am quite pleased, but with some reservations.GOOD THINGS:* Reliable, so far. I installed it at a *very* remote location far from home; a place that actually has DSL but is too far for me to reach more than a couple times a year, and is not accessible to others.  Thus I need total reliability.  So far, so good.  All 3 cameras worked right out of the box and are still working in a harsh environment.  The location is not quite as far away as Mars is for NASA, but still very hard to reach thus total reliability is a must.* Video quality is quite good.  I can easily make out all of the detail I require, and enjoy seeing deer/elk/gophers/birds etc running around on my remote property.  I have used (and discarded) several cheaper cameras with low resolution (640 x 480 for example), and these are SO much better!  Even viewing live over slow (256K) DSL upload I can clearly see what is going on.* Alerts are effective and do a good job capturing action.  Judging by the results, the camera is actually recording all the time, but only saves video for a period that starts just *before* something triggers an alert (i.e. motion detected inside one or more of the alert boxes you defined) and then runs until some time after the alert action ends.  This is a great feature because you don't miss the beginning of whatever triggered the alert.  I had some cheaper units that didn't do this, and they were of little value.  Also the alert triggering is quite reliable; again compared to some cheaper units that had many false triggers and many failures to trigger.* You can easily view your live cameras and recordings from a remote location over the internet with virtually no networking hassles at all on either end, which I think is almost a miracle.  In other words, you don't need to open any ports on your router or modem, and it all just works.  Wonderful!* You don't actually need a PC at the remote location at all because Logitech's software allows each camera to be accessed remotely over the internet (but I did anyway - see below).NOT SO GOOD:* As far as I can tell, when you are viewing a live picture you can take a snapshot any time you want, but you cannot manually start or stop taking a video.  I really wanted to do this several times to capture some action that had not triggered an alert, but the only way to have the camera record video is to have an alert defined.* There is no webcam capability, thus you cannot share your live video or snapshots with anyone else.  This really is a surveillance system thus apparently not intended to provide webcam capability, thus I can live without this but it would have been nice.* Although you can view your live cameras and recordings remotely as mentioned above, if you want to add the capability to *manage* your cameras (set or change alerts, turn sound on/off, turn night vision on/off, etc), you need to purchase an annual subscription to Logitech's Web Commander, which I reluctantly did.  Alternatively, if you do have a PC at the remote location, you can install Logitech's Alert Commander on it to perform those functions, and then access it using a free product like TeamViewer.  I chose to do both as insurance against failure, and am glad that I did. See next item.* Access to your cameras via the internet is done via Logitech's servers.  This makes setup and management easy, but - they don't always seem to be available.  As I write this, I can't access my remote cameras through Logitech, which is very disconcerting!!!!  But I know they are working, because I can access my remote PC via TeamViewer and see the camera output on Logitech Alert Commander which is running on the remote PC.  So why not just use Alert Commander all the time?  In my case (over very slow DSL), the picture quality via TeamViewer is really low - far too low to be useful.  But it does give me another way of knowing whether my cameras/phone line/DSL service/electric power are all working.  I also have an answering machine at the remote location that I can call to verify phone & power.* Every so often while trying to access a remote camera view Logitech Web Commander, the camera will give an error saying that the camera is \"offline\", which is very alarming.  Logitech's software then also asks you if you want to \"remove the camera\" which is just crazy.  Fortunately, every offline incident has resolved itself.  My guess is that if you try to view live video from a camera that is currently capturing video that was triggered by an alert, it reports itself as being offline because it can't handle too many things at once.Despite the foregoing comments, I still think this is a nice surveillance system and I am glad I got it.  In fact, I am planning to add a few more cameras, including some at a 2nd location.  And someday maybe Logitech will make a version that I can drive remotely, like NASA's Curiosity on Mars.  :-)", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Logitec Folks Are Incredible!", "Author": "Lee S.

Last Christmas my son gave me one of their Harmony Programmable TV/Audio controllers, and for the first time in recorded history I only had one remote at my favorite chair instead of the five previously necessary.  Even better, Logitech supports their Magic Controllers by connecting them thru your PC to their web site where the latest (and oldest) control command data is stored.  Definitely a 5* device, altho it did take me most of a day to finally get all the kinks worked out.  It was all pilot error although.I have virtually the same praise for the Logitech Alert 750i Master Security system.  It only took me about an hour to get it up and running and most of that was spent trying to figure out which CAT 5 cable I could unplug from my overburdened router to make room for the Security system device.The system consists of a remote camera and a power supply/network adapter.  It is almost totally wireless as the unit uses the wiring in your house to carry the camera data to your PC.  The only problem with getting up and running, was that the installation software called home to Logitech and downloaded a newer version of the software.  Completely painless to me except it required me to find a metal paper clip to unbend and reset the camera once.But now I can sit here at my desk and monitor both video and audio anywhere I put the camera.  Not only can I sit at my desk, I can log on to a Logitech website, provided a user name and password, and monitor my camera from afar.  Not only is the video data logged to a file on my PC, and internal micro SD chip.This is a great thing that simplifies installation of video monitoring systems.  Logitech's instructions come on a giant sheet of paper, and there is no manual provided unfortunately.  But, you will not need further instruction as the installation procedures show you exactly what and how to do it.I wished they also sold additives to the system that would detect door openings etc; however, with just a moment's thought I realized that the built in motion detector provided exactly that capability.

Before you do anything put the CD that comes with the system in your computer in order to install, and then follow the onscreen instructions. Be sure when plugging in the network adapter to your router, and the outlet that you use the blue Ethernet wire supplied, and then when hooking up the camera to the power supply you use the yellow Ethernet cable supplied. The stickers covering then ends of the adapters make this a no brainer; one yellow, one blue.If you have an outside camera to install the access hatch is screwed on. Indoor cameras you can pop the access door off with your fingers.The Micro SD card is already installed in the camera so don't be confused by the larger adapter they include with the set. It looks like a regular sized SD card but in reality it is an adapter that accepts the micro SD card into it so that you can read it in a larger SD card reader.Next step is to go into settings, something you can actually access anytime and setup the following options; 1) alerts to email or phone. 2) Turn on audio recording and set the volume level. 3) Define motion zones that trigger recording. 4) Pan and zoom cameras. 5) Turn off camera LED's.When you first operate the system expect some updating to go on; first the adapter after which you will have to unplug them and then plug them back in, and then the camera updates. Make sure the camera (s) you have are both recognized before updating. The reason why they are not instantly recognized is the network adapter update needs to complete installing before they can be recognized. You will see it clearly marked on the screen until they update.Now we are up and fully running. It is amazing that for free you can log in at the Logitech web site and see your cameras from the web. Clear as a bell you could be in Florida or anywhere and see any camera you want in your browser full screen. If you have a smart phone such as an Android, you can get alerts over the phone and view it on your phone.Let's say you are on vacation and no one is supposed to be home when you are away. You just set your inside cameras to alert and you will get a phone alert and be able to instantly see the room. It auto-records so you don't miss a thing.Logitech has come a long way with this system over their earlier Wi version. With this new one with an outside camera and it is semi-dark it looks like daylight. If you have a motion sensing light outside, unlike the old Wi system, the new one instantly adapts to changing light; it only takes 1 second max. No more waiting 10 seconds for the lense to adjust giving you a washed out view, now it is almost instant. That's a wow.With the increased clarity of the picture, and the improved camera settings, and being able to zoom at no extra charge makes this a no-brainer, and the system can grow over time for up to 6 cameras.

However, I have rarely been dissatisfied with a Logitech product so I gave it a whirl.Installation turned out to be relatively effortless. The connection of the cameras through plugs to the electrical system was painless, and the signal is strong to my Windows 7 PC which is located one floor above. This particular kit came with one interior and one exterior camera, both of which produce bright, clear images. When motion-activated (they are quite sensitive), they record activity on a local SD card in the camera. The images can later be loaded into an archive on the PC if you wish to take up that much disk space (the amount that can be assigned is adjustable). The night-vision of the exterior camera is quite good.One problem that arose shortly after setting the system up was that the exterior camera began dropping out. Sometimes it would re-establish contact with the system, and sometimes it had to be manually refound by the software. This wasn't usually a problem except that you had to check to see if the camera was on or not, and it could be off for hours before discovered. Later, a software upgrade seemed to reduce or eliminate this problem and the system has remained stable ever since.The system can be configured to send you an e-mail through its server every time it detects motion, but due to the sensitivity (the exterior camera reacts to passing cars that are in its peripheral vision), the annoyance of so much vigilance caused me to turn notifications off.I use the system to monitor activity on and near my front porch, and inside the front door.

I could not believe how quick and painless it was. It's not 100% wireless (you need power for the cameras, of course) but there are no wires running to the router. The fact that the system runs off of a router is just that much better! It clears up ports on your computer and it can be accessed from any computer on your network.I do have problems connecting to the night vision camera from time to time. It's closest to the transmitter, so I'm not sure of why there's such a problem, but I find that I have to power cycle it manually quite often. The night vision on the camera works great, though! I live in an apartment complex, and the camera works great for capturing neighbors arguing in the apartment next to me without them noticing.

The resolution is excellent for both.  As stated by other reviewers, the outdoor \"E\" model with its night vision is the more versatile (and expensive) of the two. One has to leave lights on if the indoor \"I\" model is to be used for 24-hour in-house monitoring and can't be used outside. That said, the indoor model seems to have slightly better resolution and appears to be more motion sensitive with the same software settings.Both types of cameras run warm (which is ok) but it would be wise to make sure any outside mounting is completely shaded for all daylight hours.As for the network adapter, it worked well with my house wiring regardless of where in the house the cameras where plugged in. As a note for network people, a simple home setup is easy. If, however, you have multiple network segments, be sure to put the cameras and the monitoring PC on the same subnet unless you want to do some extra work. Logitech also assumes you have a  firewall and/or a router AND have the DHCP server on the device enabled.One more point, after an \"account\" is setup with Logitech, the camera(s) initiate and maintain a TCP connection to a remote server.  This is essential for the remote web viewing/alerts. More on thislater.The monitor software setup was a snap and seems to work very well.  The setup was, in fact, \"plug and play\".  All of the cameras were found within a few seconds. It did not work properly on WinXP64 because of the 32 bit \"net framework\" included on the installation CD. XP32/Vista was fine (I assume Win7 is good also). Lots of features, functional, nice interface.Comments:As an alternative to a paid professional security system, I'm of two minds. The system is not quite in the same league. This is because the \"human\" component of the paid system is missing. The human component really being the person at a central office whose intuition, suspicions and experience is difficult to replicate. An example would be the action taken if a phone/cable line was cut or the power turned off.If security is the reason you buy this system, be sure to do a good job concealing both the camera(s) and the wiring during installation.  Be sure to shut the LED's off also.  Otherwise the camera will be easily spotted and destroyed/stolen/disabled. Set a password (via the Commander software) on the camera(s) as well.As I mentioned earlier, the camera(s) setup an external network connection to a remote computer for web access and phone alerts. This is a major selling point from Logitech and a very desirable feature with a potential darkside. Anybody who gets your password, possibly a rogue employee/co-worker, unhappy ex-spouse, password stealing virus or even law enforcement personnel, could view your camera(s) just as easily as you. From anywhere in the world. Instead of you DOING the monitoring, you will find yourself BEING monitored.Summation:Even with the above caveat I think Logitech has made a first-class system.

We've had a similar system that we had used as a nanny-cam when our daughter was younger. the great benefit to such systems is that there is no hardwiring required, but you also are not using wifi either - it uses the existing electrical wiring in your home to connect and communicate.Because of our positive experience with our previous equipment we were excited to try this system out and we were not disappointed. This logitech has a few features our older version doesn't offer, so we think it's pretty great.Advantages:Easy to set upUses existing electrical wiring for power and communication between camera and computerNO WIFI requiredCan view  the camera images \"real time\" from the internet (great for home protection or nanny cam)If your computer is off it has a SD card that it records video to which you can then download later.Can be set up to activate with motion, so it's not recording hours of nothing, but only when there is activity.Disadvantages:To have it always on and always able to view from the internet means you have to have it hooked up to a computer that is always on and always connected to the internet.Depending on how much video coverage you want it can get a bit pricey to add pieces.If you want one of the cameras outside it can be tricky to find an outlet in a good spot for the camera w/o having a long cord running up your wall (most outdoor outlets are down low, and you typically want your outdoor cameras up high)Need to be at least a bit geeky or net-savvy to get it up and running (or pay someone who is...)If you were able to hook up your own home network or wired/wireless router you will be fine.---------Compared to having a security company come and hardwire video monitoring in your home this is very inexpensive. However, you need to be a bit of a do-it-yourself type person or you may get frustrated. I'm that way and had no problem, yet I can tell my husband would have been irritated/frustrated doing it because he's not very techie at all (so bear that in mind...)If you want it as a covert nanny cam you will need to find an add-on camera that is hidden as a clock or something (which is what we had) as the cameras that come with are pretty obvious and not something easy to hide (unless you are a do-it-yourself type and get creative by stuffing the camera into something else as a disguise)All-in-all I recommend the system - it's a great option for those who want simple video monitoring or who don't want to pay the money for a hardwired system.", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Easy Installation", "Author": "Colt S.

Set up is done through your router. All you need is one port on your router, and you're all set. There's a power/communication box that is connected to your router. Another power/communication box is hooked up to each camera. A total of 6 cameras can be connected per system. The outdoor camera and box are waterproofed. The instructions state that it's important that the outside power box be mounted vertically-straight up. The instructions make this clear, yet omit the \"why\".The installation of the software is a breeze. After the installation, the software connects to the internet for updates on both the software and the firmware for the cameras.The cameras record on motion, which is saved on a 2GB Micro SDHC Card. Longer record saves can be achieved by using larger storage cards. The videos that are stored on the card are only transferred to your PC when the Alert Commander is running. If the software is not running, then the internal memory on the cameras are saved and rotated when the card gets full. Older videos are replaced by the latest. The amount of storage can be allocated on your PC.The primary use for these cameras are for security video recording and they do pretty well. I noticed that my camera recordings are saved prior to seeing cars drive by.The motion sensors can be set to be triggered if movement appears in the entire viewing area or just on a specific section of the total view area. In addition, the sensitivity of the motion sensors can be adjusted. Factory default is %50.My primary desire for these cameras are going to be for video taping nature from my home.

It's several steps improved over their previous security system, but is it perfect? Well, not yet, but it's close.Here are my thoughts on the Logitech Alert:PROS:1.  Forget about grainy, pixelated video images!  The Logitech Alert produces the best images I've seen on a security system.  During the day, you get fine color videos.  At night, you get black and white video from the outdoor camera with the slightly spooky look of night vision.2.  The command software is also a cut above what I've seen previously.  You can set cameras with LED signals, or you can turn them off altogether.  You can see video from all your cameras or just one at a time - your choice.  And you can draw around an area to avoid triggering the camera unnecessarily.  All of this right from your computer.3.  Cameras do not require that your computer be on.  They are triggered by motion, and the videos produced are saved on a tiny memory card.  When the card is full, the camera will write over previous video.4.  Save the videos you want on your computer, or send videos to a Logitech site - or both.  Again, your choice.5.  Quick install for the indoor camera.  Mine was up and running within the advertised 15 minutes.CONS:1.  Quick install for the outdoor camera - no way!  It took me a few walkabouts to decide the best location for the camera.  Then I had to consider where I would plug in the power source.  I did not want to have the power outside where it could easily be removed by an intruder.My solution was awful.  I installed the camera inside  above a door in a window.  Of course, the window reflected back into the camera at night, functionally disabling the camera.  Fortunately, I had already tested the camera's night vision in a totally dark room, so I knew the problem was not that of the camera.Now I will have to have an electrician reinstall the camera outside and run wiring from the roof to an interior electrical outlet, so I'm far away from a 15-minute install for the outdoor camera.2.  These cameras run entirely from electrical power because the signal goes through your electrical system.  How Logitech could make a battery-powered backup is beyond me, but if your power fails, then your security has failed as well.  Could this be improved while keeping the cost down?OVERALL:Although this is not a perfect security system, for homes wanting security at a reasonable price, I would recommend it.

However Poor/No night vision, Very slow motion (Frames Per Second ), the video quality is good. Of course no 2 way audio. Yesterday we had a power outage. The whole Alert system went out and NEVER came back up. I called Logitech Support for the Alert System  ( 1-888-469-4543 ) and after spending 1/2 hour on the phone with the tech I eventually learned that the Router Must Be Reset AND Each camera, along with the master Alert unit that drives the whole Alert system . For those of you that wish to use this in a remote application, e.g., a beach/mountain home where there is no one there, you are out of luck if the power goes out. Someone must physically go/be there to reset all the above  for the system to begin working/recording again. I have a remote home in Costa Rica where we have frequent power outages and would be totally out of luck with this overpriced system. If someone is always at the location of the cameras you should be ok. This system is still Very overpriced in my book as there are many other and better options. I sell video surveillance systems in the US and in Costa Rica [...] and what one gets with a simple 4-8 camera DVR, H-264 system, is a LOT better. When the DVR looses power and the power comes back on the DVR re-boots and continues to record. I have these all over Costa Rica and not one failure, plus they are per camera much cheaper... I contacted Logitech over 10 days ago about re-selling their systems in Costa Rica and still have not had the courtesy of a reply from them but at this juncture this is not a product that I would care to sell to my customers..
