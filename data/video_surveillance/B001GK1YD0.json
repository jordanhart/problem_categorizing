Sadly,these bums weren't only eye and noise pollution but break in's were going on during the day and women were feeling scared as these guys would intentioningly block traffic by walking as slow as possible down the middle of the street and making obscene gestures and bang on the cars if they tried to get around them.Then there were the night disturbances of them getting into fights late at night with the other jive-times they ran into. At first, the nice citzens in our neighborhood seemed beside themselves until we realized the police and probation were probably looking for some of them so the last thing they wanted was to be filmed! We ordered seven of these cameras and got them mounted high-I mean on top of roofs and up by telephone poles where you could see them from the ground but not close up and where they couldn't be gotten at.A few neighbors had real video cameras to film them with but mostly we used dummy cams like the above and the undesirables were soon driven off though for a while it was funny watching them trying to pull up their hoodies to cover their faces or attempt to find ways to move up the street without being \"filmed\". One neighbor told me the last time he saw them he heard some of them treking through our neighborhood around 11pm at night saying \"Dem damn mo foes habs stuck cameras every werez\". Happy to say, these cameras have done the job-the traffic was rerouted and we have a neighborhood that looks more like the Brady Brunch neighborhood than than a neighborhood in Detroit. So this brings back to the four stars versus the five stars. Four stars because the cameras worked for us in our neighborhood but no five stars because the camera was no good if closer observation was made of it-this could be a pain because it meant all of them had to be put up on our roofs which could be a pain. If one doesn't mind that,the camera is great but if that is not an option skip the camera and buy something more realistic looking.", "Date": "June 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Super cheapee, but worth it.", "Author": "Jill Johnson", "ReviewID": "R3DCSN8QBR0WBF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "A cop stopped by the shop so ask for my video.

The real value is if you actually install this in a doorway where people will see it, so that they can laugh at how terribly fake looking this is. The only way it could look more fake is if there was a sticker that said 'FAKE!'. That said, it's hanging at the entrance to my apartment right now, just as an ice breaker for guests. The mount and rotation bracket are about as cheap as you would expect from a free gift from Cracker Jack box. The plastic looks even more fake than the Amazon photo portends, and has an appearance more akin to a Happy Meal representation of a 1950's robot. Also, don't expect the camera to 'follow' the subject.
