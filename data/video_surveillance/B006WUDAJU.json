I just put the camera up and tested the camera and wow what a piece of junk.  The resolution quality is very poor and there are very dark areas due to the bright sun.  Well if this is to be used outside then what do I due with the dark areas.  So then I waited till night time to test the IR system and another let down.  If you are looking to watch your home up close you will never see the perp.  I will definately be sending this crapper back to market.", "Date": "August 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Outdoor security camera", "Author": "Lin Hammond", "ReviewID": "R1X9WF23I7YN0Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like this camera very much. I installed it about 18 feet off the ground. It works perfectly at night without any lighting and in total darkness. The picture is very clear. I would purchase this camera again.", "Date": "June 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Roberto", "ReviewID": "RE71BLD3N2J32", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "reason I bought this camera is my father has same one and it is bright at night and very high quality picture.  Plus, I like that you can actually see the camera because of its size....my other cameras are small and you can hardly tell i have a security system on the outsides of my house", "Date": "July 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "THE SELLER WILL NOT REPLACE DAMAGE PRODUCT", "Author": "Daniel C.

This camera is installed 30 ' from the ground and 50' from the loading dock.  I picked this camera as it has a manual zoom.  Once set-up for zoom you need to manually focus. This is not a problem except for needing a second set of eyes on monitor.  I am happy with this purchase.  Good value!", "Date": "August 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not bad", "Author": "WarrOne", "ReviewID": "R1KD29J9B782D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a halfway decent camera.  I was finishing up security install and needed one more than originally planned.  The audio and power are totally standard and worked with the other equipment flawlessly.  The fact that it is an outdoor camera without needing a box was nice, but I thought it could have some thicker rubber gaskets to make sure that it lasts through years of bad weather.Also the camera didn't have the \"throw\" that i was expecting  from this style of camera, but the price was right.", "Date": "June 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Much better ir output than most others I've tried.", "Author": "brian west", "ReviewID": "RF0RHPXJWFNEP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I think this is a great camera if concealment is not an issue. Looks much more professional and higher quaility than your typical kit cctv camera. I've got mine zoomed partially to a 20 foot wide section about 50 to 60 feet away and the ir's give me enough light to a person, though no detail. I live in the country though and it gets pitch black!! Though picture quality is improved from 480 cameras, I don't feel this gives the image quality one would expect with a 700tvl camera.Still great camera and a solid build.", "Date": "December 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Value and Quality", "Author": "Lisa", "ReviewID": "R19J9LY929HWL3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a good outdoor camera with weatherproof housing. There are many infrared LEDs (maybe about 65, I forget) for night vision, so the image quality is very good even at night.

I purchased this security camera as an upgrade to an existing home security camera. This camera is definitely an improvement. The camera is easy to use and operate, has great zoom features. Very decent image quality in low lighting situations with quick light response. In fact, I considered this brand because I bought this brand product and felt it was ok.
