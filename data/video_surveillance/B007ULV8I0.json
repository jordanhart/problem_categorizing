I am more than pleased with the quality of the picture and the range of the night vision is excellent. I was pleasantly surprised when I turned hooked up the first one. The picture was very clear, colors are vivid and most important to me are in focus up close and far away. Night vision is bright enough to read wording on a t-shirt at about 50 feet in a confined area such as a within a fenced, (privacy fence) in area, however if the area is \"open ground\" the night vision will illuminate the area but, in my case, fine detail is sacrificed. You are Still able to easily follow the movements of the subject its just not able to \"ID\" an individual at approx. 75 to 100 feet out. In my case 3 of the 4 cameras work beautifully the fourth has an IR issue at range, but for the price I paid I can live with it. Hope this helped you with the decision to buy or not.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Liked it so much I bought a second set", "Author": "D. Darby", "ReviewID": "RDIH1ENE8UL5N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Installed a set in the front yard (the hard part is determining best location) connected to a video server (http://www.amazon.com/IP-Network-Server-Broadcast-without/dp/B000HBVTCA) and running 'motion' on my Linux server and liked the results so much that I bought another set (and another video server) for the back/side yards.  The daylight color looks quite good, the nighttime black/white IR is also sharp (for about 25') and then fuzzy but recognizable shapes (cat v human) until about 50'.  I liked the idea of no moving parts (i.e., less chance of breakage) so choose the Defender brand.  I'm glad I did, they are metal (no plastic) and fill solid, hide the cord and perform well for my needs.", "Date": "October 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Security camera system", "Author": "JOHN L.

One had an outside temperature problem and the other did not work in low light at all.  Their 24 help line is a joke.  Noone will ever answer the phone, it's just a recording.  I don't call that support.  Had to E mail them and 5 days later I got a response asking me to explain the problem further.  The first time was clear enough.  When the temperature outside was above 90, I would get vertical lines on the picture.  Enough said.  Then they told me where to mail the cams back and they would decide if they were bad.  I had to pay the postage and it was going to take 30 days to get a response back from them.  With all the hassle I got with them, I would NEVER buy from them again!  Total junk!", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Electronic Technician Review..", "Author": "Justin", "ReviewID": "R363JC88J35BRR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Each camera runs on 12 volts / 500 milliamps. The power supply that comes in the box is 12 volts / 2 Amps, (but in reality is probably only pushing 1.8 amps). This would explain why some people are having a problems powering the 4th camera, because it doesn't have enough current. Fortunately, i was lucky and i was able to power ALL my cameras with that one power supply.The screws that came with the cameras are weak and almost too small.The camera's IR LED's are surprisingly noticeable during night vision operation.Still, the best camera's for the money..", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent system just wish they had a different support model", "Author": "rnwes", "ReviewID": "R2PMQYV0VZYCKN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is pretty much as advertised, The cameras do the job. You're not going to have amazing clarity or spectacular night vision but for the purposes of monitoring the exterior of your home, they do the trick.The only issue I've had is that one camera was defective out of the box.  I called support but never had the opportunity to speak with anyone, just instructed by recording to open a ticket with Defender's support group.  The turn-around time could definitely be better but they did send me another camera.  I paid for shipping to Defender, they paid shipping back to me.I would say for an entry level security camera system this one works but if you're looking for fast turn around with support you may want to research reviews a little more for a manufacturer with a different support model.", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great cameras", "Author": "Jerry L.

Yep, that's what happened.  I ordered Defender's 8 channel, 4 camera Pro surveillance system (21112), and then realized four cameras would not be enough.  For some reason, Defender doesn't sell the camera that came with my system separately, so I had to order this four pack of cameras.  This camera is almost identical.  It also records with 600 lines of resolution and is sufficient as an add-on to my existing system.  The only problem I had was I needed a slightly longer cable for one run.  65' was not quite long enough, so I had to order a 100' cable separately.  So now I've got six cameras working 24 hours a day watching outside my house.

Bought a more modern DVR, with 8 channels, instead of the current 4 cameras.  The Defender cameras give a much nicer view, the playback is about the same on the old DVR (haven't swapped them out yet), hoping it's just the old compression of the video.The lenses that came with these was kind of narrow field 6-8 mm, but was simple to change the lenses from the previous cameras, 3.6 mm.  A little wider would have been nice, but not worth buying.The power supply for the cameras was a little weak for 4 cameras.  I've got 3 cameras running fine off it, the fourth is using the supply from on of the old cameras.  Didn't notice, until the first night, and one camera's IR illumination wasn't working.  Pretty noticeable, since it was in the carport.  Was still getting an image though, only took a moment to resolve.  They do work well at night.Will probably buy another 4 pack of these soon after I get the 8-channel DVR installed.  These are good cameras for home use, not sure if I'll be able to read license plate numbers, or get fine detail, but much better than what I had.", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "best deal on amazon", "Author": "rfogarasi", "ReviewID": "R3BN7F7N3ERMF1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Cameras were clear, just as specs advertise.
