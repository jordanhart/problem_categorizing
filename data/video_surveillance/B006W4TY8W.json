Bottom line is the camera works and records to a mini sd card (not supplied). this allows for overlap after card is filled up. I was told recording to PC , does not  overlap or overwrite oldest data. didn't know if files just keep expanding on the hard drive???I had some issues following the manual, caused me to call the tech support line twice. Well that was a pleasant surprise! All my issues were addressed and explained real time with the technician, Jake in this case, very good support.", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B006W4TY8W"}}
