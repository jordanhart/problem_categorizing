Works great for the price. Much easier to use than I thought it would be, just two buttons to control it. I uploaded a video I took with it in a fully lit room. The quality isn't fantastic, but much better than expected. It doesn't work very well if the room is any darker than it is in this video.I took the video standing about ten feet from the wall I was filming, so the camera is a lot more zoomed in than I thought it would be. Notice the video is a bit shakey; it seemed to me that I was holding my hand still. The audio in the video is quite echo-y, as well, but that's to be expected from such a tiny device.Overall, you won't be shooting any HD movies on this, but its great for everyday! Its a perfect size for my key chain.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hate to give one star, but...", "Author": "wutzthedeal \"wutzthedeal\"", "ReviewID": "R1D1V5R2MGZAFB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The thing works, and it isn't horrible, but here's the problem; the one they are shipping is the #19 (get your Google on) and it does not have a separate crystal to keep date and time, so you have to reset the date and time via notepad on your computer EVERY time you power the unit up.  Secondly, the depth and clarity of video suffer; anything more than 20 feet away will blur.  The audio is pretty solid.  I recommend NOT using this seller, who has given me nothing but \"Try this, try this, try this,\" type responses to set date/time (when it's IMPOSSIBLE to keep it with a #19) instead of just giving me my dam money back; had to go through Amazon and get a gift card to avoid the drama.  The next one I'm going to try is a step up  (it's the new black and silver keychain cam that reportedly has higher resolution and motion-activated recording--believe me, if it doesn't work like it says it does, I'll be twice as harsh on it... we can't let these sellers succeed at false advertising and keep making money!

HOWEVER, about two weeks after owning it something strange happened. All the sudden no sound, so I opened it up and found out the mic had knocked itself loose!I also used this on some of my RC airplanes which do vibrate however I used folded paper towels and a little piece of cell phone sticky pad, to cut down on that.Side notes: The micro SD card can easily fall behind where the slot is and possibly get stuck if you don't have small tools to get it back, low light conditions aren't that great, but you can make them out and what is going on, Easier to do with sound.Would recommend, might suggest spending $25 and getting a Better quality one.", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good little camera", "Author": "Madge", "ReviewID": "R1MT6BVQQDR72L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got the camera pretty quick.

It has no internal storage and  cannot be used until you put a (for best results - Class 4) micro SD card in it.  So I had to wait 2 more days to use it for the card to arrive.  I got a 16GB card from Amazon for about $10. Close range audio is perfect and loud, video quality is excellent. Obviously you cannot expect HD video.  It is more than worth what you pay.  I have not yet tested the length of recording but did make three short recordings with it.  When I plug it in , as instructed, A box pops up on my computer, I click it and video instantly plays through Windows Media Player.  It is my opinion that those who left reviews saying it didn't work, did not read the instructions and they tried to use it without a Micro SD card.  If you read the instructions and follow them step by step, you can't go wrong.  If you skim through the instructions, I can see how you could get frustrated.  It takes a minute to figure it out.  The instructions for changing the date/time stamp are lacking.  Definitely have to be a little computer savy to figure that part out.
