Also, there is a rattling sound sometimes when I'm using it that gets picked up on video.  It did come with extra pen ink inserts so that was nice.  Clip is pretty durable, but appears that it could bend or break at some point.  Fatter than I thought, but nearly everyone just thinks it's a pen.  Overall, four stars and I'd recommend.", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Outstanding", "Author": "Robert K.

The camera pen worked great -- once.  After that, it would freeze every time I tried to use it.  The worst part of it all is that you don't realize that it has stopped recording until you go to play back the video.  In my case, it completely destroyed the one opportunity I had to capture important covert video.  I reset the pen and attempted to use it for subsequent, less important, needs and encountered the same problem again and again.  Unfortunately, I didn't even remove the pen from it's packaging until 4 weeks after purchase and, by the time I encountered the issues, it was too late to return.  Yeah, I wasted $50 on a camera pen but that missed video opportunity was worth thousands.", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Good Product for the price", "Author": "M.

Instruction manual was very easy to use. If you leave it recording it records in 30 minute intervals.

I bought this as a replacement and the only thing wrong with it is that the camera is facing down. i used to be able to get a clear shot of a persons face and surroundings but you have to point the camera upward (not straight) to get the image that is in front of you.

BitDefender deleted the files without issue and I was able to view my recordings easily, directly from the Video directory on the pen... the first time.A few days later and after I rebooted my machine for an update, I put the pen in to view some new videos and the Video directory that was on the pen was gone, along with the Audio directory that was previously there. I tried to make a new Video directory and was told that a directory with that name already existed.  Only after typing in G:\\Video\\ in the explorer address bar was I able to see my videos.I have to do this every time now. Not a big deal and I could always just change the properties of the folders but after thinking about it, this is probably a good thing in case someone gets their hands on it, they won't know to type in the name of the folder to view the recordings.As far as video quality goes, I must have gotten a rare unit because my video quality is great for a camera lens the size of a pen tip. Audio is equally as good.  If you are looking for HD Video camera quality recordings, buy a real camera. If you want descrete  and reliable video and audio at the touch of a button than this is a great item.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not working this is just a simple pen.", "Author": "Sandeep Soni", "ReviewID": "RS6OU1BIX0OOM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've tried many ways to on the camera but it didn't work, I don't think it has any camera they are fooling us.

Let's set aside the fact that this supposedly new pen camera showed up with a video already on it.  Let's set aside the fact that box containing the pen was already opened when I received it...This camera just isn't very good...at all.  You can forget about full-motion video.  ANY movement results in a blurry or distorted picture.  Taking a snapshot requires tapping a button on top of the pen...which sorta defeats the point of having a HIDDEN camera.  Sound quality is atrocious.So, I have a \"hidden camera\" that can't take full-motion video, can't take snapshots without revealing the camera, can't record sound at anywhere near a decent level, and can't be turned off since the \"English\" instructions are nonsense.  For example:\"Looks like the pen operating instructions to record\"\"In closes down and under the readiness for action, presses the button short...\"\"Long time according to button close down\"\"This time allocates move set clock for pattern selection switch...\"\"When is recording, if this fime electric quantity is insufficient...Save your money and buy something decent.  This pen cam is rubbish.PS:  The video showed the sweatshop where this rubbish pen cam was made.
