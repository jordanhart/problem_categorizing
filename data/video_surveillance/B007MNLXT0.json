{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Borescope Inspection Camera", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R2Y9IU3JVLD235", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Works as described. A couple of things to note:- the screen is detachable and once detached continues to show the camera output seamlessly. Nice feature- Image and video quality is good.- The LED lights in the end of the probe are reasonably effective but don't expect too much in narrow tubes - the foreground will be overexposed and the background underexposed - something you have to expect and not what I'd consider a fault.All in all a bargain basement borescope that works well. No complaints!", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B007MNLXT0"}}
