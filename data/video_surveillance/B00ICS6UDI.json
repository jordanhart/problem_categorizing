{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera, no subscription, amazing picture, easy set up", "Author": "Science Experiments", "ReviewID": "R1Z2RFXVQZ9E7Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I agree with the previous reviewer: why is no one reviewing this great camera? I just bought one and the camera is great. The HD picture is high quality and seems to work well for long distance and up close viewing. It has a night filter and IR lights.The best part, compared to other cameras, is that this device is totally self-contained - you don't need to buy a monthly subscription to take advantage of all the features, unlike some other popular cameras - be warned - the subscriptions will cost you more than the camera after a year or two, so list price isn't everything.* This camera can take snapshots and email them to you.* It can do motion detection and email you those.* It can upload video clips to a website for later viewing.* It can save video or snapshots to a local SD card (not included).* It is upnp compatible so most modern routers will automatically connect it to the outside world.And on top of the great features, Sharx support team is amazing. The documentation included with the camera is clearly written by a native English speaker, and it is very detailed, clear and thorough.When I emailed the team they return my emails with a personal response within a business day. They are thoughtful individuals who care that the product works and that I understand how to use it.For example, this camera has a ~70 degree field of view suitable for viewing an entire indoor room when placed in a corner. My application needs a much narrower field of view. Rather than return the camera, Sharx worked with me to get replacement *lenses* that I can install (or they offered to install at their service center at no charge) to get a different field of view. It feels like I'm dealing with a company from 40 years ago: their products can be disassembled, they have intelligent staff I can talk with, they will send me discrete parts that I can use to adjust the functionality. They trust their customers and work with them.If you're in the market for an HD camera and you should take a good look at this one. The camera and the company are great.", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Why are more people not talking about these GREAT cameras?!?", "Author": "Brandon B.

Thank god I did! I was going to consider Dropcams as well, but a huge requirement was being able to stream locally, and not just to a cloud solution. (Ah, hello big brother...can I get some privacy, please?) I was 100% sold on them until I talked with their customer service and they said that even though it was their number 2 complaint, they had no plans for offering local storage. I'm out, as that's just unacceptable for an IP camera! I wanted a camera to work with my Synology Diskstation, no exceptions.Trying to find more information on Sharx, I only saw one video review on the SCNC2700. That's it! It was a great little review, but I still felt it was a risky buy. To top that, all the Amazon reviews were few and far between and they felt staged a little. Well, I'm all about these great cameras now! I am so glad I closed my eyes and hit the purchase button. It ended up being a great decision over the competition available right now!What I love about these cameras:Easy setup (like stupid easy)! The instructions and information was rich with detail!Had to be able to record locally to my NAS (Synology in my case).Even better, if my Network hiccups (never does, but still) these guys always record the primary stream to MicroSD. THAT'S HUGE!!The video is really smooth at 1080p, and I have three of these things all running at once.Night Vision is way better than most cams I've seen. Another huge win!It's wireless B/G/N, with WPA2 support, but I still have the option for direct Ethernet connections.These cameras are just great. They're just a little more than Dropcams, but Dropcams are actually 720p (firmware limited) even though the video cap card is capable of 1080p. The night Vision is better than Dropcams as well. And to be able to record locally (SD), AND to a NAS at the same time is incredible!! There are essentially 3, fully configurable separate streams available with these cameras. Perfect!! Well worth the extra $39 over Dropcams. You're getting a far better product!!I'm on board, and I really hope you guys catch on and review these cameras as well! They are overlooked here on Amazon, but I hope they sell more. Next to my Synology 1512+ Diskstation, this is about my best amazon purchase yet!", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "The camera (and more importantly the company) are FANTASTIC!", "Author": "dkoretz", "ReviewID": "R3LX8RDDD1FF7G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have multiple homes around the country, so security is always a concern. I have now purchased the latest version of these cameras, after the company offered me an upgrade from the 2700.These guys offer responsive customer service, bulletproof cameras, and reliability.While there are a ton of cameras on the Internet for dirt cheap, most of them are total garbage.The new 1080P is awesome. I just watched a vendor in my Manhattan place re-do my flooring from 2,500 miles away in stunning clarity.I wouldn't buy cameras from anyone else.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works as advertised.", "Author": "D.
