I installed them under my overhang of my house out of the weather. They both failed within 3 months. The camera power cord failed along with the camera on both. I did get one sent back and took me 3 weeks just to get there customer service on the line. When you return this junk do so on the website. You do have to pay for the shipping it to SVAT.  I paid good money for these cameras and am so disappointed. The real kicker was they sent me a new one but didn't even tell me what was wrong with the first one I returned. This manufacture need a lesson it customer service. Buy one with great reviews only.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "wireless camera", "Author": "ohcarol", "ReviewID": "R3TWM5R6VDJI7V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "we already had the main system just needed two more cameras------less then a week later  we watched someone break into the garage.  called 911 and got them.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "It has Pro's and Cons", "Author": "D. Eisenman", "ReviewID": "R19HNDCAOT4FSR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This system gets FIVE stars for ease of setup. The cameras paired up with the receiver very easily. The downside is: resolution at distances is pretty poor unless you have the 2X zoom on and even then it's tough to I.D. a person. The system says it's focused best at 20 feet which is accurate. The Night vision system works just as good as the day system. (Reviewers have complained about color and yes, color is not great,  however I want to be able to recognize faces, not tell what color clothing they're wearing).A note of caution for new users: Make sure the green lights on the wireless receiver that you want on are ON.. I hit the motion ON button twice on the system remote and turned recording OFF by accident (Extra frustrating since there was a theft next door last night!).Overall: If you want a specific spot monitored like a front door, this system is excellent. At distance - the zoom setting is helpful but not the best or clearest.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "disappointed", "Author": "cara taylor dugan", "ReviewID": "R3N3UH6S33Y2HY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "have 4 camera's hooked up to main screen, camera flash's no picture half the time ,always flashing no signal,very annoying. have disconnected.looking for a better wireless camera ?", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works well", "Author": "splashy", "ReviewID": "R18AMVX1HJH58C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was easy to put up, paired easily, and gives me a birds eye view of my driveway.
