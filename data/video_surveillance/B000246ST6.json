{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Too much vibration", "Author": "david_f_knight", "ReviewID": "R3J8GBX9GMCHKI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Due to the low price and generally good reviews, I bought this item.  The suction grip is very strong; there seems to be no risk that this will fall off a window even with a small camcorder attached.  Mine did not come with the extension arm, so my camcorder had to be mounted upside down on the windshield.  The image can easily be rotated 180 degrees within Sony Vegas Movie Studio Platinum 9 editing software, so being upside down is not a problem for me.  Furthermore, having an extension arm might likely result in less stability, so it's probably best to use the shortest/sturdiest mount possible.  (I haven't tested that claim so it might not be true.)  My camcorder, with optical image stabilization, zoomed all the way out for the widest view (also the least sensitive to vibration), and driving on a reasonably smooth paved road even as slow as 20mph exhibited very noticeable vibration.  The vibration is too great to use the video.  Much smoother video is obtained by hand holding a camcorder in a moving vehicle; your body and arms act as shock absorbers and dampen vibration preventing it from reaching the camera.  With this mount, small vibrations from the moving vehicle are transmitted directly to the camcorder and it seems to be amplified by the time it gets there.  Furthermore, my high-definition camcorder, with a CMOS image sensor (which uses a \"rolling shutter\"), exhibits noticeable skewing artifacts from frame to frame as a result of the vibration, so there are not just blurred frames and jittery motion, but distorted frames as well.  Consequently, even using a motion stabilization algorithm during post production won't produce acceptable results.This mount should be excellent for situations where there is no vibration and no need to pan or otherwise modify the camera settings or view during exposure, but seems useless from a moving vehicle unless it's moving very slowly on smooth pavement.  ---------- IMPORTANT UPDATE -----------I just noticed a few recent reviews that mentioned they received a knock-off, rather than a genuine Panavise 809.  After studying the Panavise picture on this page very closely, I see that my unit is not a genuine Panavise 809, either.  (There is no manufacturer or product ID on my unit or on the packaging, so I have no idea who manufactured it or what its true model name is.)  I purchased my unit from Vangoddy through amazon.com.  Perhaps that explains why so many other reviews are so good (especially the video review left by Thomas which shows, though at slow speed, how good his unit works) and my results are so bad -- and I mean BAAAD, truly unusable.  There is no comparison between the results I obtained and those that Thomas showed in his video.", "Date": "December 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent, but not for off-label use", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1Y0ZWWLXD5CGQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This clearly is designed to be a CCTV mount. As such, with most CCTV cameras having top mounted attachment,  I have no doubt that it works flawlessly.It is very well constructed and does indeed have amazing suction power and solid construction without any \"wriggles\".I bought it hoping that I could use it on the fairly steeply raked windshield of a late model Civic to film driving routes with my digital camera. Even though I have a low profile \"ultracompact\" digital camera, there was not enough room between the windshield and the mount to allow me to mount the camera - unless I mounted it upside down, which I obviously could not do because of the inability to rotate the resulting movie.FORTUNATELY I discovered that the Civic has a flat non-porous ( i.e. plastic ) top gauge cover, and was able to mount it on that. But the vast majority of cars have curved top gauge covers, so I don't think this will be suitable for any but a few car models for the purpose I'm using it for.If Panavise could come up with the same assembly and a U - shaped holder for mounting a camera with a standard tripod screw thread from the bottom, BELOW the mount - now that would be far more useful.", "Date": "June 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Be careful about the extension arm", "Author": "Jim B.

a camcorder, you'll definetelyneed an extension arm which originally doesn't come with the product.Please see my user photos after January 8th, 2010.The user photos showing the extension arm are a little confusing.I bought a geniune one directly from the Amazon, and it doesn't havethe extesion arm which I later got directly from PanaVise. The guysover there are terrific, and extremely helpful. They said the modelwith the extension arm should be called as 809-X.The video was recorded with Xacti 1010I passed over two railroad crossings (at 1:44 and 3:33), the roadwas terrible.

I purchased this unit but the angle of the mounting arm made it unusuable with my truck windshield. So I sent it back to Amazon and opted for a Sunpak Clik n Stick mount Flexpod Click N' Stick Suction-cup Monopod. I recently upgraded to a Panasonic SDR-H40 videocam Panasonic SDR-H40 40GB Hard Drive Camcorder with 42x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and needed something a little more substantial to hold the bigger, heavier camera. I originally thought that this unit, attached to one of those GPS friction mount pads that can be placed on the dashboard, would be perfect, but then I found out that Panvise now includes a mounting arm extension with this unit. (See the customer photo that shows the extension arm and a camcorder mounted in a car). So I bought another one. This appears to be just the solution for mounting a video camcorder in a vehicle. If you order one and the extension arm isn't included, just contact Panavise directly and they will send you the extension arm for free. No instructions for installing the mounting arm extension were included, but it's pretty easy to figure out how to install it. This unit holds tightly and seems to be pretty stout and secure. The mounting arm extension Panavise now includes makes all the difference in the world. I think the company realized that there is now a market for sturdy vehicle camcorder mounts. I recommend this highly!

I know a lot of people like the Panavise 809, but some people have ripped on it because it doesn't include an extension arm. When I received mine, it worked very well even without the extension arm, but I had to invert (180 degrees) my video in software. Well, the *real* solution lies in Panavise's EXCELLENT support! I called up their support number (775-850-2900), and mentioned to the operator that I was calling about a CCTV mount (the 809 model). She forwarded me to someone else, who was a VERY kind woman named Julie; After describing my dilemma, Julie nicely explained to me that Panavise was working on including the extension arm in future, but that she could send me the extension arm. She quickly took down my name and address, and told me that it would be on its way tomorrow!!Panavise is an EXCELLENT company! The 809 CCTV mount is GREAT! The price is GREAT! The quality is GREAT! Thank you, Panavise (and Julie, if you're reading this), for being so amazingly awesome! You have made me a very happy, satisfied customer!", "Date": "March 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Needs Extension", "Author": "AG", "ReviewID": "R3P84NO7D7D77R", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This product will not work out of the box with the Kodak Zi8 or Flip Camcorders (possibly other pocket cams)on windshields.

I ordered it thinking it would fit in my window of my car.  Big mistake, the pictures they show are not the same as the Panavise 809.  The ones they show are with an extension on the Panavise 809.  If I had the extension it would probably work. Now I am going to have to send it back and order one with and extension and hope it works.

It's very simple to use, very sturdy and versatile -so you can use it in many different angles and situations-.

There is no expanding adjustment on the arm to remedy this.You could side mount this to your driver/passenger window - or place it at the back windshield facing toward the windshield.Generally speaking, you will have to hang a standard sized camera upside down, and then flip the video in post edit.Be warned, the mount has no basic shock dampener what-so-ever.  Any vibration your vehicle gets will be transferred to the camera.This goes for home window mounts as well.If your camera has an extended mount, or you can buy one, this would allow expansion for a full sized HD video camera.This is somewhat ridiculous though, as the extension is dirt cheap to make - but is not provided.

with the windshield of a car. It is almost 10 minutes in duration. You can make your own judgment by watching the video and hearing my comments. The only thing I would like to add is beware of imitation. Buy direct from the company or from Amazon.com.EDIT (May 1, 2010): An extension arm for the device can be obtained for FREE by calling PanaVise. I recently got mine from PanaVise and it just works great. I do not have to mount my camcorder upside down anymore. You can see my video on this on YouTube.

The mount is not advertised at all to have this mount but it sure came with one. Using my Canon Vixia HF100 it was a bit too bouncy. Even though that is a small light HD Camcorder it still weighs a few pounds.[...]It is a very small digital cam that can record reasonable quality 720p res video. A nice advantage too is a digital camera will give you a much wider field of view than a stock camcorder lens. I found the cam jostled around a lot less, and I think it was because it was so much lighter. It did however have this audio static when it was mounted for some reason.Anyway, the mount is well worth the money. I am not sure if you could use it on a race track.

Strong holding power.  I mounted a large outdoor camera with it, and with the included length extension, which causes additional \"prying\" forces to be applied to the mount.  But the suction cup has held perfectly so far.  There are adjustments for every degree of freedom (if you include the rotation of the mount on the window).  Installation is just 1) mount the suction cup; 2) hold the camera in place while tightening all screws down.Caveat:  This is a great mount for installing to stationary glass in fixed structures.  That was my intent, so I gave it 5 stars.  However, if you want a vehicle mount, I think there are better (though pricier) options available.  I recommend using a small tripod with suction cups on all 3 legs.  It's a matter of mechanics--there is going to be more flex in the single-point mount of this item.

The suction cup creates a rigid coupling that hasn't come loose yet, at least in the hour or so at a time I've had it attached to the tank.  The arm articulates nicely so that the cam can be set to level (or at whatever angle you'd like it to be), and extends enough so that the cam sits nicely behind the fairing and out of the wind.  The rigidity of this mount is a big improvement over another mount I tried in that the Flip doesn't flop around (pun not intended ;).  This is important as the Flip does not stabilize the captured video and tendency for the cam to move while operating seems exaggerated in the resulting video.  The Flip is small and light, and I haven't tried this mount with my larger cam.

I bought these mounts for both my wife and I, and we were able to get some FANTASTIC shots from our car instead of freezing our butts off using a tripod in the wind and snow. We did get out to shoot a few times, and I was cold in spite of my four layers of clothing.Here's what I like:1. This thing holds on like a vice. We never once had to to re-suction them to the window, and I kept my Panasonic FZ200 clamped to it while we were driving as well as shooting. My wife uses a Nikon D5100. Incidentally, the outside temperature was about 28 degrees, with a wind chill of about 17 degrees. Wind about 30 mph.2. The car window can be rolled up completely with the mount still attached, and it's easy to move the camera down and out of the way when you are not using it. There is no need to take it off the mount when you are driving from one location to another.3. The ball head can be removed and kept on the camera base if you want to put the camera away for a while.4. I detached the whole unit from the window, with the camera still attached, and kept the mount attached to the camera when I shot outside the car. It makes a great supportive handle to provide more hand-held stability.5. A hint: Take the ball head off the mount and screw it into the camera base when you first attach the camera for your shoot. It's easier than attaching the camera to the mount while the ball head is still on the mount.6. It's small enough to simply keep in the car, though I'm going to experiment with using it for taking images of birds feeding from our window feeder; have to get a remote first, though.7. Actually, it rotates in two instead of three planes, which is a little inconvenient.

I used it with my Canon T2i/550D and had great results with it mounted to the driver's and passenger's door to a moving vehicle. I also mounted it to the hood of the car and the picture looked great.  There was minor shakes and jitter while going over bumps and such, but it was very easy to edit around those moments.  It's best when used with a wider lens to eliminate noticeable shake.The suction cup is very strong, but using it the first time, I was weary and opted for an impromptu, DIY safety feature.  While the camera was mounted to the doors of the vehicle, I hooked the camera strap to the door handles in such a way that if the suction cup lost it stick, the camera wouldn't fall to the ground and would still be attached to the car.  It may bang against the door until you're able to pull it in, but that would be better than having it hit the pavement in my opinion.  While it was mounted to the hood of the car, I hooked the camera strap up in a similar way to the windshield wipers. I also used a shoestring for further reinforcement.  Fortunately though, the suction kept the camera completely mounted so these precautions weren't necessary.  Here's the actual video I used the mount in: [...] .

At first the camera (a Panasonic PVGS80) wouldn't work with the mount due to the arm on the mount being too short unless I wanted to mount the camera upside down. I did as others suggested here and called Panavise's 1-800 number and explained the situation. They were very friendly and helpful and after verifying that I had the genuine product, - understandable seeing as reviews here indicated that there are some knock-offs out there - they sent me an extension that works with the mount and gives enough room for the camera to be clear of the windshield while filming. An added bonus is that all I have to do with sighting the camera now is to point the camera straight down the mounting arm to get a proper view straight ahead.The first footage I shot with the new assembly was incredible. Most of my videos made with the tri-pod system had some shaking and moving of the camera even inspite of the camera's image stabilization system. The first time using the Panavise 809, even while shooting the footage, I could tell that the camera was hardly moving and the resulting footage showed that the Panavise 809 kept the camera rock steady even during a hard acceleration that had the car going from 35MPH to 80MPH.In summary, if you are looking for a excellent windshield (or any other window) mount for a small video camera, give the Panavise 809 a look.

The Camera used in this in the video was a Flip UltraHD Camcorder, 120 Minutes (Black) I need to learn how to convert these files so it dose not look blurry.

At only $20 this was a great bargain. With this in mind, I figured it would stand up to some abuse while using it mounted to my gas tank and to the fairings of my Suzuki GSXR. After recieving the unit through the post I opened up the package to find a rather heavy duty item. This thing just looked like it was designed to be put through the wringer. I immediately attached it to a mildly smooth table (not glass). I was amazed how strong the sution cup was when affixed and clamped down! I then mounted it to my tank and took it for a ride and sure as anything, that thing just stuck like it was welded to my tank. Playing back the footage I can see that it actually did a decent job of providing a little bit of cushion to the imperfections of the road while using the camera on some not-too-smooth roads. I was expecting much more shaky footage than I got from my camera. The ultimate test was my track bike. I have fibreglass bodywork on my track bike that I rattle canned myself when I bought the bike. I was never much concerned with looks so much as I just wanted the bike useable. When I rattle-canned the bodywork, the paint ran a little bit and I have imperfections where I mounted the suction cup. Nevertheless, that sucker stuck to my imperfect bodywork like it was welded on! I tried just the mount first. Then I mounted the camera on the side of the bike. AMAZING! I have heard some people are using this primarily for smooth surfaces like glass but I personally report that it will work on imperfect relatively smooth surfaces such as motorcycle fairings, unprofessionally painted surfaces, and the like.Pros: Cheap price, VERY sturdy materials, strong suction cup attached very well, fast shipping, standard universal camera bolt, compact size.Cons: None I could find.Bottom Line: BUY IT!!!

rigidly mounted to the base.

Matot \"GMS\"", "ReviewID": "R2U8G0QBQ3IQBJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a suction cup mount for very small point and shoot cameras. It arrived in a box with a sheet of instructions. You press it against clean glass, push the air out with the PRESS button, and pull the locking lever. Then attach a camera, and that's it. I use it for a small fuji point and shoot all weather camera in my Toyota Yaris. Works as described.Pros: low cost, ease of use, versatile.Cons: short mount arm - almost impossible to use on windshields, poorly written - contradictory instructions, flexible = added camera bounce.Summary, this device is intended to be used on nearly vertical or horizontal glass, not a sloping windshield. The only way it can be used on a windshield is if the camera was upside down. It is designed to be used only with tiny lightweight digital cameras.On my car, on the windshield, when the arm is extended up for a normally positioned camera mount, there is not enough clearance between the top of the camera mounting screw and the windshield for any device. Maybe your vehicle windshield has less of an angle than my Yaris and it may work for you. And use on a door window doesn't work because there is not enough clearance to see around the roof support column to look out the windshield. It might work from a sunroof or a bathroom mirror, but only for a tiny point and shoot camera. I should try mounting it to the car hood. I did try once mounting it on the outside of the car on the windshield but feared I would earn a ticket for doing so.additional comment: After trying a few other suction cup mounts, I revert back to this one because of it's short size it adds minimal camera vibration. However, the camera you use on this must be very small because it is difficult for the camera mounting surface to give enough clearance from the mount itself to put much of anything on it.

The Panavise is pretty much a global standard for mounting lightweight cameras, including lightweight, memory card video cameras, to pretty much any flat, clean surface.Our city wasted who knows how much money on grinding down about 2 inches of concrete off of our 27 year-old street, which was in very good condition, then applied asphalt over the concrete that remained as the base. I needed to take a quick video of the length of our street to archive the very good condition of the already existing 27 year-old concrete. No problem. Got my Aiptek A-HD 720P camcorder, threaded it onto the Panavise 809 (1/4-20 thread), quickly cleaned a small spot on the hood of my CR-V, stuck the Panavise to that spot and threw the lockdown latch, then jumped in the car and went for a ride. When I got back home, I popped the Panavise off of the hood and reviewed the video. Perfect!Some folks use this or other versions of the Panavise 809 on the inside of their windshield to mount certain radar detectors or GPS devices which are equipped with threads.

I did call Panavise as some suggested and the courteous Panavise rep told me that the unit does not come with the extension arm but that she would ship one to me immediately.  All I had to do is give her the Pat N\u00ba.  Not quite sure how long Panavise will honor such requests, but in reality without the extension arm the use of the Panavise 809 on a windshield interior with a acute rake will not be effective, unless you camera is very low profile or you mount the camera upside down.Construction appears substantial.  For the money it is worth it and I would trust the Panavise 809 to hold my camera on the exterior of the vehicle.  In fact, I will.  Adjustments are easy.  Would certainly buy again, but only with the extension arm or as long as that is being made available post Amazon sale.  Perhaps Panavise should include it by default or Amazon should advise of the package contents so that buyers are not confused by the user pictures.Glad to give it a 4 star.  Would have most certainly given it a 5 star were it not for the missing extension arm.Maestroso", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent!", "Author": "open file", "ReviewID": "R2WKDQYSY6060E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice little affordable mount.

Considering the purchase price of around $30 I was expecting a flimsy, plastic feeling product that was only truely useful during ideal conditions (ie; low speeds and perfect roads). Panavise blew those expectations out of the water. The 809's construction feels very sturdy, and the locking points haven't losened a bit during any one of my uses. The suction cup is very powerful, once fastened it stays, no problem. I've used this on the inside and outside of my 350z, on the fairing of my sport bike, and even tried it on my quad. The image stability impressed me the most, besides the quad (just too bumpy for my camera), my videos came out great, even above highway speeds on the outside of the vehicle. I would highly recomend this to anyone looking to catch some motorsport fun. By the way, I have been useing an awfully small and light camera (a Canon sd1400 is) but I'd trust a larger camera too.

They still work great. However, lately I have had issues with them falling (though not when in use!). I would find at least one of the mounts lying on the floor of my car.

The mounting stud was defective. It is too long. And yet it fits easily into the camera, just as theoretically it was designed to do. Unfortunately, once it fits inside to the degree that the camera is stabilized, that too long stud destroys the camera.Comparing it to other tripod mounts at the repair facility, someone at the factory either put in the wrong screw, or created a defective product. It is not the customer's responsibility to ascertain that a product is not defective. However, in trying to deal with Panavise's owner, I've been stone walled, informed that some mysterious G Force must've attacked the camera (seriously), told that a  washer missing from the product that was shipped to us was no big deal, there couldn't possibly be a QA error even though the stud in ours is twice their own indicated stud length measurement etc. In other words Panavise refuses to talk to the repair facility that repairs thousands of cameras every year and can explain precisely what the problem with the mount is and how the damage would have happened. They refuse to talk to me or my son. But they insist they can't be wrong, hoping I'll go away. Hoping that $800 plus dollars in repair bills will just vanish.Do you want to support a company that does business this way?Please, if you buy this product don't install it without measuring the stud and measuring that of a standard tripod mount before using it.
