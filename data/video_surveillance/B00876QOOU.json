After I had the existing camera replaced with this one, I immediately ordered one more!I'm not too sure if there would be another camera in this price range (I bought this under $80) have better night vision than this one. One more thing to my surprise is that the picture from this camera would immediately turn into color from black & white during dark as my sensor floodlights turn on (None of my other cameras would do that).Compared to the \"Vonnic C104B 1/3-Inch Sony CCD 480 TV Lines 36 IR LED Night Vision 120-Feet\" which I also had bought 2 of it a couple of months ago for about a little over $10 less each, I would rather have spend the $10 more go for this camera if I had knew earlier. The Vonnic was also a very good camera,  but this one is really worth to spend the little extra more money.I would highly recommended this camera which provides excellent day and night vision.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Deception", "Author": "philippe rendak", "ReviewID": "R1ESH1UUPOHL2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Review was good, Sony technology, bla bla bla, good price. Not much to lose. So I ordered it. Was a bit surprised by the size. Looks much bigger on the screen and the vendor doesn't provide dimensions... Anyway, I wish I could say it is a nice CCTV camera but it simply didn't work. I had a blurred image once I connected it. There are no instruction so to speak, just a very thin description. Very fussy adjustment are to be made with a finger mouse. That mouse attached to the incoming wire simply didn't respond as if it were broken. It definitely was... I am under the impression that I was sent a defective camera, probably someone had already returned it for the same reason.. because this item would not have passed a Quality Control test.  Anyway, I was refunded without question and they didn't even offer to replace it. As the old saying goes 'you pay for what you get'. The less you pay the more likely you are to run into problems.

Notice from the picture that the camera body is close to the mount. With the hood on, the camera is a bit limited in its positiong capabilities.I found the image quality to be good in daylight, and a bit bright and washed out at night.For the price, though, it was pretty good, so I purchased two more. The problem is the IR lights in one of them, and also in a replacement from Amazon, quit working after a few days. Wasn't my cables, since other cameras worked. So out of four copies of this camera, two stopped working. Not willing to try the odds anymore, I stopped buying this product.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "KERBY MILLER", "ReviewID": "R14BZED59AUIU6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera for the price.

If your expectations is to find a super high quality HD image then this camera is NOT for youIt does not zoom (nor was I expecting it to)  and the night vision is on average with some white outs compared to similar models.  if your buying a camera, what most people care about is the lens quality (its a sony lens low mm)  the internal components (again Sony) (quality construction) and price (value). I can confirm its insides are Sony compnents with a Sony lens. The instructions are the usual instructions from Chinese products (ie. translated english from Chinese)  made to look pretty in a color brochure.I can barely read license plates, but I can see faces. I was not expecting to read plates. The daytime color separation is phenomenal for the price. You do not get a power supply so be sure you buy/use a power supply with the correct amps.  Seller was prompt, shipping was done with high quality foam to prevent damage.ONE minor COMPLAINT: the tool used to adjust the angle of the camera is so tiny and  hard to insert into the camera screw to adjust the angle.", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worthwhile investment.", "Author": "Robert Weech", "ReviewID": "R3AWSEX4537SA7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this to replace a standard camera supplied with the DVR.

This is not a 500 dollar unit so don't expect license plate reading at night, but it is heads and shoulders above the other cameras in this class. Great picture, and excellent construction. I still have no clue why they put the control switch so close to the camera, since it stays outside, but I don't care much about that. Price to quality ratio is good.
