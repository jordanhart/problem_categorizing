I have a night owl security camera system that included four(12-IR)security cameras(420tvl) not bad for the price or for the urgency to protect my property a bit since my home had recently been burglarized. the night vision on these night owl is probably good for like 15' and very fuzzy defenition(off coarse not professional grade) although it did the job mean while I always felt I needed to upgrade and after about a month and consistent research/review's I did decide to go with the Qm6008b model and let me tell you that the night vision is great, the day time is even better. Very well built and sturdy. You won't be disappointed. If your property gets a bit of street light like in my case, the night vision is like a regular black and white tv image. I have had the qsee cameras(8) for about 3months and no complaint. The night owls where sold. Shop around and you may find very good deals on them", "Date": "May 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Big Improvement - Highly Recommeded", "Author": "C. Hill \"CFH\"", "ReviewID": "R3Q26S7GTWV7O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These Q-See \"High-Resolution 600TVL\" cameras are a big improvement over the cameras that came in my Zmodo system and can be used to directly replace those cameras using the existing video/power cables. We use a zmodo system for security recording at our shop, and it generally works well except that the cameras do not always provide enough clarity for easy face recognition from a distance. These cameras are significantly better in both image clarity and night vision functionality.To be clear, this set is the 4 cameras only (with power adapter and cables) and not an actual monitoring/security system. These will all work with the systems from the major brands (Zmodo, Defender, Q-See, etc) or to any device that takes composite video in (most TVs and video recorders).These are an excellent choice when you want to upgrade just a few cameras on an existing system.Highly Recommended!CFH", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Upgrade from QSM1424W", "Author": "David Tullos", "ReviewID": "R2S2TV06G2SQOI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought these as an upgrade from our existing QSM1424 cameras.

This is simply a 4-pack of the cameras, with the exact same specifications and performance. If you need 4 cameras, this pack offers much better value per camera over the 2 pack (price fluctuations notwithstanding).Made of metal, these cameras are very solidly constructed and sturdy. There is a good amount of heft to them and they are quite substantial feeling in the hand. They definitely don't feel like they'll fall apart. Setup is very easy.The cables are Y shaped on both ends, and color-coded and labeled as to which end connects to the DVR and which end connects to the camera. One small AC adapter powers both cameras. I used a BNC to RCA adapter to connect the cameras to my TV. The cable routes through the base and then through your wall, so it can't be cut from the outside by vandals or intruders. Setup was quite easy and I was ready to test out my cameras within 10 minutes of unboxing. I didn't have to calibrate the sensors.I tested the camera in normal household lighting, dim indoor and outdoor lighting, and total darkness. Under normal lighting, faces were easy to recognize. Under low lighting or darkness, the camera switches to infrared mode (color drops off) and faces become a bit harder to distinguish, but not by much. This isn't a problem unless you are trying to identify the faces of total strangers from more than 20 ft away. Clothes and other features are still clearly visible and sharp. There's no lag or interference, and what surprised me was the camera being able to catch specs of dust floating around in front of the lens! (My basement is dusty).I put one of the camera in a room of total darkness and panned it around. The infrared sensors worked impressively. I saw all my furniture and clutter in bright grey scale, with no loss of clarity. Aiming it down an unlit corridor, I got about 30 ft of clear visibility towards the back of the house. For outdoor monitoring, effective range varies a lot with lighting conditions and obstructions. You'll have to play around with placement to get the best angles and performance from the infrared LEDs. For best results, you shouldn't have any objects in your line of sight close to the camera, as the infrared will bounce off these surfaces and blow out the image to white. I had some rose bush branches near my lens, for example, which limited the range of the camera. After repositioning to a clear line of sight, I got a good view of my neighbor's porch about 30-35 ft away. I think this is the ideal radius for outdoor night-time monitoring with the Q-See. But again, your mileage may vary.", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$299.99", "Features": "4 Cameras with 600 TV Line Resolution\nWeatherproof for Indoor/Outdoor Use\n36 IR LEDs for 100 ft.
