{"Reviews": [{"Title": "pretty decent, with a couple of comments", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"-Jon\"", "ReviewID": "R3CLASH3AMKXGV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "well, they look fairly convincing, I think, if mounted high enough not to be looked at too closely. They DO have a blinking red LED which comes on when it gets dark (photocell controlled) and the LED is VERY bright. Just put them up so I have no idea how long the batteries will last, but if I'd designed them I'd make the LED flash a much shorter flash, and less frequently. You can always turn off the LED, too, with the switch, to make them look like the other (real) cameras. there's some limits on how they can be positioned, too, but will probably work for the majority of situations. just be careful tightening the screws- use a power drill like I did and *snap* goes the plastic... time for a longer screw and big washer... be sure to peel off the giant white \"made in china\" sticker from the base!", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$59.99", "Features": "High-quality, well-designed and easy-installed security cameras at affordable price.
