{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good picture quality. Limited mounting possibilities.", "Author": "Alan \"Alan\"", "ReviewID": "R17YKG3MQSVOVF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The picture quality is pretty good.The IR strength is so-so.The casing and brackets appear well made.My problem was that I needed to have two of the cameras shooting down the same wall they were mounted on. Unfortunately, there was too much IR bounce-back from the wall, so I got no picture at night. They were fine for most, but not all, of the daylight hours.Unfortunately, the camera can't be removed from its supplied bracket without cutting the cable, so I had to order other cameras. Couldn't find any on Amazon, so I went on eBay and order directly from a manufacturer in China.There's a small control for adjusting the camera. Frankly, I don't see the point of it. It's inches away from the camera mount, so I'd be more inclined to change the physical position anyhow.----October 21, 2013 updateNo problem after several months of use. I live in LA, so obviously there's no harsh weather to contend with.A friend bought some cameras on eBay. Much cheaper price. Allegedly 800TVL. Their picture was not nearly as clear or sharp as the cameras from GW Security. Gave me a better appreciation for my purchase.On another note, I have since had several email exchanges with GW. Had a couple of questions. Also placed another order that I wanted to change. In all cases, the exchanges have been excellent. They answer quite quickly and thoroughly. And, they have always been friendly and accommodating.", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera for money did not require a very high quality camera", "Author": "Melville Reid", "ReviewID": "R3CPZZ65UHJPG9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use these for outside at parking lot, front gate, ect.
