{"Reviews": [{"Title": "GREAT for the Money", "Author": "Thomas Workman", "ReviewID": "R8O8MZ0GYBNXL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After spending a year reviewing, comparing and nit picking the various PTZ cameras on the market to upgrade my current system to, I landed on the Lorex 9 camera system which included the camera of this review. I have had it installed now for a week and so far, it has exceeded my expectations. Even in total darkness with very little or no ambient light or starlight, this camera captures an image that is viewable. Yes it will be dark and no it wont look like an image taken during normal daylight, but without IR lighting, it surprised me. I ran the camera to a separate dwelling excessing 200 lft. So power had to be supplied within the 95 ft. range of the supplied cables. (Lorex mentions this in their manual) I ran the RG59 to my residence and used the power leads of the coax as the RS485 leads that are needed to operate the PTZ functions.The camera operates flawlessly. You can set up the cruise by adding the waypoints and saving them. But be advised, you cannot use motion recording during cruise mode. The sensors are in the DVR not in the camera, therefor any motion, even the camera motion during cruise, will be considered motion sufficient to activate recording. So you end up recording just motion from the camera or false positives.As for quality, the zoom feature works great. A vehicle at 100 yards for example, I can zoom in and read the license plate number clearly. The only thing I don't like about this camera is the dome itself. Apparently the manufacturing process includes a 2 piece lens that is combined and the seam is polished. Insufficiently at best. Anything the camera sees is somewhat blurry and the autofocus tries to compensate continuously. (Lorex mentions this in their manual too)Conclusion:This Pan tilt zoom camera performs very well with excellent image quality. It is controllable by your smart phone (iphone/android) with a little setup savy, and FOR THE MONEY, performs as well as PTZ cams costing considerably more. You can spend 6000.00 on todays market for auto tracking and 36x zoom just for the camera alone. I bought my complete system for 1200.00 including the PTZ.You will be pleased with this camera, but since all installations are different, be sure to read the specific manual for the equipment your considering. The videos sell the product only and to prevent disappointment and frustrations, be sure to read the manuals.", "Date": "August 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exceeded my expectations", "Author": "Ran", "ReviewID": "R32B0KZVIBP1T2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My car was vandalized about two week ago so I made the decision to invest in a surveillance system. The system itself works wonderfully well. Day time is in color, and night vision is in black and white. At night time, the camera can see just fine with normal street lighting.I did some heavy research before purchasing this camera. The picture quality is sharp, and the controls are very responsive.I would definitely recommend this camera and would gladly purchase another.", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do not buy any thing from Lorex", "Author": "B Tyler", "ReviewID": "R1NN1IIU2O4XOA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have the Eco 4 lorex system that has the ability to control this camera.The Lorex system is not able to email actual photo's of events as they happen.If you set the system to 1 min interval emails (the fastest) and it triggers on a camera then during that 1 min. interval no other cameras can be triggered and the delay in the triggering protocol means you miss the actual event (so for example someone is walking through your camera array and triggers the first camera the delay means you miss the photo of that person and then the other cameras don't trigger for the next min. ridicules! The PTZ camera has a manufacturing fault in the Plexiglas dome where 2 sections have been joined causing a blurred image all the way around at the cameras high tilt point. normally these domes are one piece so as to cause no distortion to the image.Lorex customer support will tell you to just return it,but it takes a lot of time and effort to install plus drilling holes to run cables.Trust me DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM LOREX, their products are poorly designed and do not work as advertised.I am technically knowledgeable and proficient and have wasted days on installation and troubleshooting.The Lorex client software is poorly designed,The Tech support people poorly trained.Don't waste your money.Shame on Lorex!", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Cameras - Horrible Dome!!!", "Author": "ONELIV \"N5Y\"", "ReviewID": "R3F01J4IDOH3LA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Lorex has produced a Great camera. It was just what I wanted. ***However be aware of the limitations of the pan because the Dome has a Line (Flaw) in it. I installed 2 cameras one at 14 ft and another at 20 ft and the line in the dome made them unusable when zooming out. if you will be using them for an overhead only then you might be satisfied. if you want to zoom across a room or lot I believe you will have some issues as I did. I contacted Lorex and they are aware of the \"Flaw\" but have no fix. If they had worked, they would get a 5 star rating. The only reason I did not rate it a 1 star is because the Camera itself is excellent. Do your homework for this Camera.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not very satisfied", "Author": "John Spane", "ReviewID": "RWU6XHNKR1V8V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Found the camera to have shading or hazing in certain positions not very satisfiedCamera also seems to be sensitive to certain requirements such a severe cold", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$599.95", "Features": "High performance pan/tilt/zoom camera.
