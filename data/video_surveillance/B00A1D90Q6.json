I can say without a doubt this is the best deal around.  The system works great and is very easy to install.  I won't go into detail because several other reviewers have covered the operation of the system and how easy it is to install.  The system does have its limitations, you can't set the arm or alarm delay lower than 1 minute.  I would have liked to set it at 30 seconds or below.  You can see from the build quality that this is a mass produced product from China however you can't expect ADT quality components for $180 or less.  I've been following the reviews from others for several months and no one has yet to complain that the system falls apart after 6 months.  I've had it installed for two weeks and it is working perfectly.I've only had two issues, I ordered 5 additional window/door sensors from Fortress Security and one of the sensors was bad.  Mike from Fortress sent me two replacements right way.  The external siren had a short which blew out the power supply so Mike sent out a new Siren and power supply.  The system comes with a 3 year warranty, I have to believe that the components are above average for the seller to warranty the system for that long.I know this is a product review but I have to give Mike from Fortress some props.  I have called him several times over the course of the installation and with the two hardware problems.  He was always very courteous and helpful and responded quickly to all of my requests.  His customer services skills are well worth the price of the system.  Great job Mike!", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "What the instruction book doesn't tell you...", "Author": "Tony Haukap", "ReviewID": "R1QWCJ0SSQZTXT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Most of what I've written here isn't going to make any sense to you unless you have already read the manual or are already familiar with how alarm systems work. This is more of an installation guide supplement to the supplied instruction sheet.The instruction booklet that comes with the system has been rewritten by the supplier, it's okay, but doesn't go into a lot of technical detail. I found a copy of the original \"32 zones wireless alarm system\" manual online, and you can tell it comes from the same people that gave us \"All your base are belong to us!\" The rewritten guide is a good start, but I'll try to fill in what it leaves out.When you open the box you see there are two power adapters supplied with this system, one for the control panel and one for the exterior siren... the power adapters aren't clearly labeled and look identical, but they are different... one is 9VDC the other 12VDC. The 9V goes to the control panel, the 12V is for the exterior alarm.Here's what the instruction book doesn't tell you...You can program more than one sensor to a zone, ie. you can have a motion and 2 magnetic sensors all in zone 3 or all smoke alarms in one zone. At first I thought the 'magic-8' first zones, where you can specify delay, chime, home, etc. were going to be a big limitation, but after I figured out you can have as many sensors per zone as you need it's not that much of a limitation after all... as long as you plan ahead.The zone type 'home' doesn't have a delay - I thought it should/would, but it acts as 'instant' unless the system is in home armed mode. Keep this in mind when you pick a location for the control panel... again, planning the layout of the system and what sensors are home/delay can save you a lot of trouble later.The system comes pre-programmed, but you might find resetting the control panel and starting from scratch better suits you needs. A good example is when setting up the sensors to use the zone numbers to identify areas... for example 01-09 can be the main floor, 10-19 the garage, 20-29 basement, 30-32 shed... etc. you get the idea, that way when a sensor trips with a quick look at the control panel you'll know if it's a 2X number sounding it's coming from a sensor in the basement. I think you'll find this a very handy feature and worth the time it takes to reprogram the control panel and that leads us to the next tip...Once you enter sensor program mode you can program everything by just entering the next zone number and activating the sensor. After you hear the 2-beeps, enter the next zone number, etc. until all the sensors are programmed. This is a big time saver and everything can be programed in under 10-minutes (don't ask me how I know this :)) Just keep in mind the program command 7# (enter sensor program mode) is very similar to the 7* (clear all sensors) command!The panic button can be programmed in any zone (09-32) and works regardless of armed/disarmed system status, as long as the control panel is on. It doesn't needs to be programmed in the 01-07 zones for it to work as intended.Motion sensors, have a usable range of about 28-feet, in the literature it states up to 15-meters (45+ feet) and a 110-degree spread - I don't know how they arrived at those figures. I tested 2 of the motion sensors in a big open garage with nothing but air between me and the sensor and never got any where near those kinds of results. Maybe they're using them in a vacuum to get 45 feet?Inside the motion sensor are jumpers on the PC board to set sleep time and and IR Sensor range. The sleep time is the amount of time the sensor waits after it detects movement to sense movement again, it can be set to 5-seconds (default), 45-seconds or 3-minutes. I see no reason why this needs to be less than 3-minutes in habitable (home zone) areas (kitchen, living room, etc.) and it probably also greatly increases battery life. The IR range can be used to shorten the distance it 'sees' should you need it.I purchased a few extra motion sensors and when I opened the box noticed that 2 of them were already turned 'on' - how long these have been sitting on a shelf in the on state wearing down the battery needlessly I don't know, but I expect to see a yellow light (low battery) any day now on those.All the wireless remote controls can be programmed into any one zone (09-32), and/or with other sensors.A full system reset (0000#) doesn't reset the exterior siren.Installation notes...I skipped the double-sided tape and screw attached everything - it only takes a few minutes to drill a hole and put a screw in it. This way I don't have to worry about a sensor setting off a false alarm if it becomes unstuck and falls off.The magnetic door/window sensors will likely need shims on either the door casing or the door itself. I used a variety of things; 1/16\" plastic laminate, 1/8\" and 1/4\" MDF to keep everything in the same plane - I wouldn't bother using these magnetic sensors on windows, burglars aren't going to open the window, they're going to break the glass! Use glass breakage or motion sensors to cover windowed areas.The motion sensor comes with a swivel base for mounting, using this base the sensor stands a good 1-1/2\" away from the wall... in testing I was able to approach the sensor by sliding along the wall without setting it off. I took the sensor off the swivel and mounted the base (\"back\") of the senor directly to the wall, you need to drill a hole through the plastic, but the entire sensor can be completely dismantled and the PC board removed with just one screw. A 1/4 shim at the top (use some silicon adhesive to keep it in place) will give you the recommended 6-degree down angle. Mounting the bottom of the motion sensor about 7-feet above the floor, there's a screw in the top you need to be able to remove to change batteries so this will give you enough room to get stubby screwdriver in there and by putting it in a corner at 45-degrees seems to give the best coverage.On the control panel the power switch, telephone jacks and siren connectors are on the side (who designed this thing!), besides why does an alarm need an on/off switch? These should have been on the rear with screw terminals, instead of the push plugs they used. And the control panel should have a much more secure way of mounting it to the wall than a couple of hooks. First thing I did was to open the control panel (screws are under rubber feet) and solder a short across the power switch - there's no reason to ever turn it off that I can think of. I was able to made a recess in the wall and to fish the wires behind the wall to the panel then mounted 1\"  angle around all four sides it to keep the panel from being removed from the wall and the plugs pulled out, but with the panel hatch closed the panel isn't even visible. Aside from mounting it out of the way in a closet, this is probably the best option to keep it near an exit door.The inside alarm siren is listed as 140db, I measured ~95db at 5-feet with a sound level meter... it's still loud, but it's not 140db loud.Now, antenna up or down is the question - or I guess I should say antenna extended, because with the magnetic door sensors they're some instances where the antenna will be pointed down - I'm an antenna up kind of guy, on all sensors no matter how close they are to the control panel and here's why... the control panel only has one chance to receive the signal from the sensor and if there's something else transmitting on a nearby frequency it has a better chance of getting through if the antenna is up. In a well designed alarm system you have motion sensors to backup the magnetic door sensors, so in reality you should have at a minimum two chances to trip the alarm, but still, antenna up is the way to go.Now for the biggest limitation in this system... the Entry/Exit delay can only be set to 1-90 seconds, yes that's seconds! The default is 30-seconds, now anyone that requires a 30-second exit delay my advice is move! :) Because this really a case of you locking the front door and a burglar breaking in the back door at the same time! 90-second is very short, in my tests this should be a setting that gives you minutes. Let's see why (assuming you're using the control panel for arm/disarm)... arm system, close exit door, wait for the garage door to open, back car out, close garage door... you can't do that in less then a minute. Now try it in reverse, your countdown timer begins as soon as the garage door starts to open, now and try to enter the house and disarm the system in less than 90-seconds... you can't. Very poor design decision to have this important setting in seconds and not minutes. In an otherwise pretty good system this is a big flaw. Okay, I know what you're saying; \"why not use the remote control\" well, a couple of reasons, but mainly because you can't hear the arm/disarm chirp outside the house, and the exterior siren doesn't sound the chips only the interior siren does and you can't hear that outside the house... in this situation you'll never really know if the system is armed. or disarmed and that's not acceptable. And a remote keypad won't help the situation either, because you're in the car coming in/out of the garage, either the designers don't keep their cars in the garage, or don't have garage door openers, or they're not putting sensors in the garage. I don't know, I don't think they thought this one though all the possible situations where 90-seconds just isn't enough.Bottom line is would I recommend this to someone? Well, for just a few hundred bucks and a couple of hours of your time you can have a fully functioning home alarm system. It does have its limitations, some more severe than others (entry/exit delay is a BIG thumbs down, as is the location of the siren and power jacks), but careful planning can minimize most of them. Buy an alarm system before you need it - it's well worth the effort - but, maybe find a different brand that allows more choice in entry/exit delays.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fortress Secure Solutions - Wireless Systems", "Author": "Robert from Hawaii", "ReviewID": "R28P67CNIVE7MS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this wireless system and it arrived promptly.  It is an excellent system.  I like the feature where you can activate the system using different zones for the sensors.  At night or while at home I can hit the HOME alarm button on the remote and can still walk around the house without setting off the alarm because the motion detectors are in a separate zone.  The perimeter (doors and windows) are in a different zone so they can still trigger an alarm.  When leaving the house I can hit the AWAY alarm button and EVERYTHING is activated.  The siren is very loud.  I ordered an extra outdoor siren to cover the front and back of my house and also ordered an extra motion sensor so I now feel very secure when away from my home.  Both the outdoor siren and motion detector also arrived quickly.Though the manual was somewhat confusing, the excellent service I received from Mike, who I believe owns the company, was excellent.  He returned my calls promptly and patiently went through each step of the installation process with me.  I was quite impressed with the service and is largely why I would rate this purchase as EXCELLENT.  The price was really quite reasonable and thus far the alarm has performed well.  I have not yet installed the phone feature, but I'm confident that if I run into any difficulty I can expect great help from the support staff.You can't go wrong with this system...great product, low price and excellent support service!", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "INCREDIBLE system, with EXCEPTIONAL customer service!  Cream of the crop - on both counts!  TEN stars!", "Author": "Beth Wilson", "ReviewID": "R3P5JGZGNQKM9A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband and I had been looking into getting an alarm system, but we really did not want to incur those \"monthly fees\" that come with the home monitoring systems.  We wanted something basic, that would give us piece of mind, when we are not home.He and I started researching different systems.  Reviews were the big thing for us.  As most everybody knows, reviews can make or break a purchase.  And when investing in something of this nature (knowing that eventually you may need to contact customer service) it is IMPERATIVE that you can count on good, reliable customer service.  Let me tell you something, you find that right here, with Fortress!I found this system and it had everything we were looking for and the price was within our budget. But the excellent reviews are what sold us!  The system is easily set up.  Nothing super hard about it.  And it does come pre programmed.  My husband did have to call a few times and spoke with Mike.  Mike cares about his customers!  He actually includes his cell phone number with the paperwork.  Every time my husband called, Mike was always available and helpful.  I also ended up calling Mike (just to ask general questions) several times and every time, he was just as nice on my first call, as on my 3rd!As I said, the system is easy to set up and easy to use. Both the indoor and outdoor alarms are LOUD.  Which is what you want.  That's a good thing.  The indoor alarm is loud and piercing.  You can actually hear it pretty good, outside with your doors closed. We are very satisfied with the loudness of these alarms.  Loud is important and loud is what you get.I want to share a story with you.  Just last week, we were re-checking all the contacts, making sure the little red light came on, when we opened a window.  All but one worked.  I e-mailed Mike, letting him know what happened and asked if he could please send me another contact. Within two days, I got my contacts.  Notice I use the plural form.  That's right!  He sent us two contacts.  I was shocked but so appreciative!  He did NOT have to do that. He could have easily sent just one, which is all we asked for.  I e-mailed him and thanked him.  After we got the contacts Mike sent, my husband was pulling the \"bad\" contact off the window and the back came off.  He saw the battery was loose.  He tightened the battery, put the cover back on and guess what?  That contact worked GREAT!  So, the contact we thought was bad, only had a loose battery.  I felt terrible!  I called Mike and as usual, he picked up the phone.  I apologized, explained what happened and offered to mail the two contacts he had sent us, back to him.  Mike said not to worry about it, thanked me for my honesty and told me to just keep those two, in case we need them down the road!Buy this system.  You will not be disappointed at all.  It's a wonderful alarm system, easy to install, LOUD and the best part?  MIKE COMES WITH IT!  LOL!  You can always count on him and I can not thank him enough for being so incredibly helpful and ALWAYS, always available.I will be recommending this system and company, Fortress (Secure Solutions) to anyone who may be looking for a good home alarm system.  Honestly, I've never been happier.  Mike, your company will go a long way, because you care and have an exceptional product!

I called the company and yes Mike answered the phone. He explained what I needed was only to exchange the keypad I'd purchased for the one that was wifi and for the difference in the price of the two. He said all the components would work with both but would need to be reprogrammed for the new one. He was willing to send me the keypad I needed (2 day delivery with no charge for shipping) and wait for my check when I returned the other. He answered any question I had although the system is straight forward enough there weren't many. The videos on his website are excellent and they are in the process of re-writing the manuals.I'm a very senior citizen and had no problem at all setting it up. It took very little time to reprogram the items with the new keypad and place all the items where I needed them.I like it so well that I've ordered an additional motion detector, remote fob and 2 fire alarms. I appreciate that I can hear the siren beep and receive a text message when I set it with the remote fob. For those times when it is disarmed but I need to set it off NOW, the panic button is ideal. The security system I had called me when the alarm went off and I'd tell them who to call (and the smoke detectors were not connected to that security system). This way I can handle it and be sure the right department is called for my rural area.", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fortress Security Alarm System", "Author": "Superiordreamin", "ReviewID": "R37QB14DL63GSI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to help protect a foreclosure my wife and I bought.  Prior to starting renovations, there was an attempted break-in and as I would be leaving tools in the home while not staying there I wanted to have some protection.Starting with the included operating instructions, don't even bother unless you're in the mood for some laughs.  It's clearly a word for word translation from somewhere in Asia.  There is a card in the box recommending you go online for the \"updated\" manual and I highly suggest you do so.The first thing I noticed, which was great, is that the system came already programmed for each of the alarm modules, both door sensors and motion detectors.  This saved lots of time as it makes it a plug-and-play product.  If you don't intend on expanding with additional modules, you're all set.Once I set up the motion sensors, I spent a couple of hours trying to defeat them.  Moving very (and I mean VERY) slow will work about 10% of the time.  Once I was able to place a Solo cup over the sensor and then move freely about the room.  Keep in mind a thief probably won't take the time to move that slow and I doubt they carry Solo cups.I haven't yet placed any magnetic window or door sensors as I'm installing all new windows and doors.  As for the phone connection part of the system, I use an AT&T; land phone to cell service converter.  I hooked it up and it did dial the number I programmed in but it's not a feature I intend to use.I placed a motion sensor and remote siren in a garage/pole building that's about 150' away from the base.  I had some trouble getting a connection but with the siren's short antennae wire near a window and the base unit also close to a window, it's working fairly well.  It always goes off when tripped but won't always reset with the key fob.My two complaints with the system are minor.  The sensors have this cheesy telescoping antennae on them, like an old transistor radio.  Not a big deal and I guess if it helps extend the range it's worth having them.  They don't need to be extended in the house so it's workable.  The other complaint is their home marketing, or lack thereof.  They include two large generic window stickers that don't even tout the company name.  I understand these things cost money and while I prefer the money goes into a better built product, they should offer, at a price, more window stickers and maybe even a small yard sign.  Advertising an alarm system will make most thieves pass your house and move on to safer pickings even if they're not sure you really have one.I've also yet to find out if the alarm will re-set to active once tripped and being activated for a time or if it just keeps going off.  Still working on that one.Overall, I'm happy enough with the system to buy another remote alarm and motion sensor so I can completely protect the pole barn once I move in.  Keep in mind you're paying under $200 for a system and it will have some limitations.  It's not a remotely monitored ADT package so don't expect all the bells and whistles.  This does what I wanted it to do and I have no problem recommending it as a stand alone system.", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "No wires, detailed step by step videos instruction, very good support, HIGHLY recommended.", "Author": "Luis Claudio Albero \"Luis Albero\"", "ReviewID": "R378HF5LA8PTD4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this to my house. Its 3 floors, 450m2 just for you to have a dimension that I put sensors on the front and at the lowest level and all of them are working just fine , wireless.The system is complete, fully programmable. Comes ready to work, but you can still customize it. It comes with one of the sensors (08) ready for the front door, meaning its a delayed sensor for you to have time to open the door and disarm the system even when not using the remote, between 0-90s. But I have a second back door that I wanted the same feature. You just have to reprogram one of the sensors to a zone lower than 08 (I used 07) and after reprograming the sensor number, put it as a delayed one.I also loved the feature that you can have audio beeps when some doors are opened (you choose which). I put that on my front and back door, so now I know when my kids are going to play outside , and more than that, if everyone is inside house and I hear the beep (even when the alarm is off) I know that front or back door was open.Motion sensors are really good, the remote siren is loud enough for half block to hear it. System is smart enough to call you in case of any breach  and you can disarm it remotely. If you cannot pick the call, it can call other 3 numbers, play a message you recorded and the person can disarm the system or not. You can also call home and arm the system if you forgot to when you left.For its price I found it an amazing product and more than that, just loved the easy support you have on their site with dozens of how tos videos.

First off, I purchased this system based on all of the other 5 Star reviews. I checked out other systems at the Big Box stores, and for the money there is no way you will beat this system.First off I was very surprised by build quality.yes everything is plastic, but none of it is the falling apart junk you normally get with cheap electronics, the plastics are solid, thick and well sealed.Second, very nicely packaged. I dont see how it could get damaged in shipping the way they packed it. The only thing short of a pro system when it comes to packing is the hard case, it comes in a thick box. I was really impressed by the packaging to be honest, not used to ordering inexpensive electronics and getting it packed this well.Third, I have been working on Computers and Electronics for nearly 35 years, knowing if it even halfway worked I could figure it out but I also like reading instructions first. Assuming that it would be the standard Chinglish, I almost didnt even bother. NOPE, well written detailed instructions. It is a basic setup instruction, but minus the wireless, the magnetic triggering for the different zones has been pretty much standard for the last 35 years.  Looking through the instructions I came up on the URL and watched all of the youtube videos. It only takes a few minutes and will definitely make your setup a whole lot easier. Not to mention the seller not only gives you the options for Customer Service, but his email address and phone number and notes you may even get him on the phone.Fourth. Setup was super easy. This is pre-configured right out of the box. Follow the video for changing the pass code, took me about 20 seconds. Setting up phone numbers was also super easy. There are enough sensors that I was able to cover every window and door access point in my house and even my basement door and had one left over. After installing everything, and testing, EVERYTHING worked.There is just no two ways about it. Ease of setup, everything works, simple installation. Took me all of 30 minutes.The indoor siren is very loud, but in a room with a closed door not that loud. Since it is plugged into the base, I would say keep it where it can be near you to wake you (At home option allows you to keep all access points secure while turning everything else off so your not walking around setting off the alarm) or in the living room to scare the crap out of would be intruders and thieves. And it will scare, startle them. Ask my wife and dog.Couple of things. On the outdoor siren it requires it to be plugged in. That is a simple fix if you do not have any outdoor plugs or in an area where the siren would do any good but if you have a light. The fix is in these links.http://www.amazon.com/Leviton-1403-Outlet-Socket-Adapter/dp/B001F71O70/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1393483786&sr;=8-2&keywords;=Light+plug+adapterhttp://www.amazon.com/Leviton-125-2-Pole-2-Wire-Adapter/dp/B001PCVTFC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1393483786&sr;=8-1&keywords;=Light+plug+adapterAlso, I use an Ooma Telo. It goes through  my wireless router. Since I was not sure if the phone option would work splitting and routing through the Ooma, you may want to buy one of the 2 or 3 way phone splitters from a local store (They arent but 3 or 4 dollars) and run it from your router, to the splitter and directly to the phone. Also keep in mind there is the option, if you do use an Ooma to run it so all of your phone outlets are active, and you can run it like that, which I am considering doing myself, then hiding the Ooma and the console for the security system. The seller even notes that you may want to use (Purchase) a splitter, that is definitely the easy way to do it.Between this system and my 3 (2 Indoor and 1 outdoor) Night visions cameras, this is an excellent system (Even without the night vision cameras it would be an excellent system)I can only give it 5 Stars, it deserved 10.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Easy to install and operate.", "Author": "Linda Earle", "ReviewID": "R8KPV3EF7AVD2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to install and operate.

I waited until my family and I had a chance to put this thing through its paces until giving a review, as I feel too often people just throw out reviews right after opening the box, or after they couldn't figure something out and are looking for something/someone to blame, when in most instances it is probably their own misunderstanding.  With that being said I don't see how a security system could be anymore economical.  My wife and I had shopped around all the major \"security stores\", ADT, Brinks, and the like only to find outrageous prices and a possible messy/costly installation, not to mention the monthly fees.  After questioning one company as to why the ridiculous prices we were told \"your basically paying for the sign in the yard.\"  After finding and buying the Fortress we were blown away at how much we got for the price, not to mention the 1st rate customer service and quality.  I installed and programmed this system throughout our entire home, and detached garage in about 2 hours.  It was one of those things  where when your finished in the back of your mind you are wondering what you did wrong because there is no way it should have been that easy.  The sensors all come pre-programmed, so its basically stick and play,  Adding additional sensors, programming the call feature, siren time, etc are all a breeze as well.  I will offer this bit of advice: immediately after opening the box, throw away the instructions, as they are obviously written by someone without a firm grasp of the English language, and you will be pulling your hair out trying to read them.  Instead head over to fortresssecuritystore.com and there you will find simple, easy to understand step by step videos, as well as a well detailed instruction manual.  We had one issue with the main panel going bad about 3 months in, I called the customer care line, and could not believe it when the # was actually the owner of the companies cell phone!  Try that with ADT!  It was on a Sunday evening, and explained my issue, and by Tuesday afternoon, I had a new panel at my front door, no charge whatsoever.  In this day in age, you can't put a price-tag on service like that.  This system does everything we need it to do. Its simple to use, reliable, and economical with no monthly fees.

It reads in excellent English and covers everything as far as I can tell.  I didn't need to go to the on line videos though I briefly checked out one before I got the system.  The one video I saw was excellent.So-So: The motion detectors came with heavy duty batteries which I replaced with alkaline.  Short leads on the terminals made the already hard to snap on terminals a pain (literally,as I didn't want to use pliers)) but could be the battery mfg fault.  Can live with it.Pro:  Response of wireless was great for me.  I have a log house with big laminated beams and the transmissions went thru everything.  Remotes worked great 25ft from house through 6 inch logs.  This is with antennas at minimum (no extension).  Antennas on the remote FOBs could easily break off I would think in a purse or pocket if extended but don't see a need to extend them.Pro:  Motion detectors worked in range and peripheral sight to suit everything I needed. (average sized spaces)Pro:  Support is as good as everyone raves about.  I called and e-mailed about a couple things and response was quick and patient.Pro:  Stuff doesn't seem cheaply made to me except on-off switches on every unit  do seem awfully light duty, will baby them.  Would prefer not to have old style antennas but they probably will be ok and probably a necessary evil since reception is everything with wireless.  Once mounted, the wall unit antenna extensions actually give me a sense of better reception, though not needed so far in my opinion,  maybe with older batteries it may be more important.Pro:  Phone thing works great, and easy to set up  Only a 10 sec message but I think that is because the designers decided to ensure as many of the calls that could go out would go out in the shortest amount of time.  I would have preferred fewer calls but a little longer message option.So, it calls up to six numbers in sequence, delivering the same 10 second message before hanging up and calling the next.  My test got the first call out in about 15 secs and the next immediately after the next 10 secs playback.  (landline to cell phone)  Altogether then I would expect it to get 6 calls out in 70 secs?Pro:  Cut landline alarm pays for the whole thing in my opinion.Pro:  Easy to add devices later.  I bought a 4th motion sensor and except for a minor question figured out how to add it to the already preprogrammed suite of the original kit.  Couldn't get through to my brain the ZONE and ZONE TYPE distinctions.  ZONE TYPE should probably be redefined as DEVICE TIME DELAY or CHARACTERISTIC or something; otherwise I stumbled on that part.  I just refuse to spend more than 1 minute reading any instruction.P.S.  Shouldn't really be part of this review but I also bought a 2nd remote keypad so that I could hide the main panel.  Things not going too well with getting up to speed on that thing.. Instructions are not anywhere as good as this SO2B new manual and I've gone into my Red Green mode with installing it.  I'll eventually figure it out.  Fortress has gotten back to me very nicely on two occasions on this and thought I had it going but I am just not doing something right. We'll get there if I slow down and listen.  Remote FOBs probably preclude the need for the 2nd keypad anyway.Anyway, this system is well worth the money.

If an intruder is smart enough to turn off your outside main breaker, this will still sound the inside alarm because of the battery located in the base unit.

I thought a little about installation sequence. I put them up in numerical order, the number is on the back of each sensor device,  because if there is an alarm the control panel shows the number of the unit that is triggering the alarm. I made a list of which sensor was on which window or door so that it will be easy to check out.Michael at Fortress was very helpful!I contacted Michael about getting extra magnets for the window sensors. (Door and window sensors are the same.) The extra magnets are so you could have a window open for ventilation and not set the alarm off. I put the second magnet about 5 inches above the closed position magnet. Just align the open window to the upper magnet and then you can arm the system. I also plan on doing the same for my window air conditioners in the summer. So if the window is forced open to remove the air conditioner to gain entry it will set of the alarm.The indoor siren would be a bit nicer if it too was wireless. The location of the alarm panel may not be the best location for the interior siren. You can add a second wireless outside siren to the system. But it is of course at extra cost.So far so good.

(It was a little odd thinking like a thief and imagining the ways we might break in and how the system would \"cover\" those ways.)The only \"downside\" to this system is that our home insurer would not give us a significant discount because the system is not \"independently monitored.\" This makes no sense to me since a with a monitored system, a break-in would alert them and they would call us before calling the police. With Fortress, the system calls us directly and it is up to us to call the police. Seems like all we've done is eliminated the middle man and a hefty monthly monitoring fee. But even if the discount had been 50% on our premium, it still would have cost us more annually for an independently monitored system and not given us any better protection.We have tested the system and it works perfectly. The sirens are heart stopping and I feel confident that someone breaking in would not hang around long listening to the sirens and believing that the police could be on the way. In addition, we took some steps to \"lock up\" some of our most portable valuables (jewelry, cameras, ipods, etc) to make sure that if their were a break in, these things would not be easy to grab as the theives made a quick exit.No system is fool proof and this one probably isn't either but we feel much more secure when we leave our house for the day knowing that we are as well protected as possible and all within a very reasonable one time expense of under $200. I would recommend this system to anyone who wants to protect their property and doesn't have tons of cash to accomplish that. If you are not particularly \"handy\" with this kind of thing (I'm not talking about the electronic/programing stuff which is very minimal, but the actual installation of the window/door sensors and the motion detectors), you might want to enlist the help of a friend who is, but it really isn't that challenging and I see that as no reason not to purchase this system.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Buy this system", "Author": "G'ma", "ReviewID": "R304U8GZ14U6ZO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I give this system AAA+++.

I did notice the one that triggered started showing a low battery condition, so I replaced the battery last week and will see if that helps.I also mounted the door/window sensors with screws and not the double side tape that comes with the unit...

I'm glad I was able to weed out the reviews by those people who should never install things themselves or I would have never bought this system. The truth is that this system is not a high end system. Does it work and work correctly? Yes. The motion detectors are somewhat sensitive to light (just like the instructions tell you)  and may cause false alarms if you don't pay any attention to where you install them. It's important to remember that the natural light conditions change all day long in every house depending on how many windows and the house's orientation to the sun. The natural lighting conditions at my house made the alarm trigger in the early afternoon around 2:30PM (PST). Solution? Move the motion sensor, which takes two screws to do.The alarm is loud....like hurt your ears loud. I consider that a positive thing. The key FOBs are awesome and have a great range. The wireless installation aspect is also a huge plus as I rent and do not own so taking the system with me if I move will be a snap. The system calls me and the other numbers I told it to flawlessly. Yes, the instructions could be a bit more \"dummy proof\" but then again if you are that challenged then maybe you shouldn't have the protection of your home left in your charge.The negative aspect to this system is that if the intruder finds the inside siren that has a wire connection to the main control panel and unplugs it, the alarm siren stops working. The good news is that the system will still go through the remote calling notification process. I hid mine system and use the key FOB to arm/disarm exclusively.", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Turn key - not so much", "Author": "James R Wagner", "ReviewID": "R28A9LUNV0TKS6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This system has a lot of options and as others have noted the instructions are more of a reference than anything else. One of the first things I wanted to do was change the master pass code and I guess I mistyped it or something. So I had to do a factory reset to reestablish the default pass code and continue with configuration. That wiped out all the sensor encoding that Fortress had done and I had to reprogram everything. While there was somewhat of a learning curve and some experimentation I was able to reprogram everything using the downloaded instruction manual. That turned out to be a good thing in that I was able to familiarize myself with many of the features that aren't obvious at first glance with this system.Now for a few observations:1. You will probably want a dedicated phone line for this system if you want it to be able to have remote access to call the system. If you have it on your main phone number you will likely have problems with things like call forwarding and answering machines or voice mail. If you set the unit to answer sooner than your voice mail then you'll never be able to receive voice mail. And anyone calling you will have their called answered by this unit. You can bypass this unit picking up at all by setting the number of rings higher than your call forwarding and voice mail, but then you'll never be able to control this unit remotely. A dedicated phone line for this unit solves those problems.2. Door and window sensor placement can be a problem because the magnet needs to be within about 1/2 inch of the side of the transmitter opposite the antenna. This is especially an issue on double windows. You find that you need to place the transmitter with the antenna pointing down if you have to mount everything on the left hand side of a door or window. Up, down or sideways the good news is that it doesn't seem to affect operation.3. The window/door sensors have been pre-programmed such that each sensor has a unique number. The problem is that the number is written on the back of the sensor and you'll be covering it up with the mounting tape. So make a good list of which sensor is where. Or better yet, mark the number with a felt tip pen somewhere you'll be able to see it after it's mounted.4. Get some good 3M mounting tape and don't waste your time with the included tape.5. the unit can call up to 5 numbers when triggered.  Very handy.So far I haven't had any false alarms and that's quite good. I use this alarm system along side a remote access video surveillance system and between the two systems will be able to easily tell a false alarm (should one happen) from the real thing.If you have the patience and technical savvy to work through all the options this system has you'll have a first class security system. If there was some way to easily attach a wired sensor to one of the transmitters I'd have given this unit 5 stars. You can attach wired sensors directly to the base unit, but you'd have to run the wires. That said, I've opened up one of the transmitters and it won't be difficult to replace the magnetic switch with a small jack so I can plug in a wired sensor. I haven't determined yet if it's a normally open or normally closed switch but that's just a matter of testing it.", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good alarm system", "Author": "Tao Chen", "ReviewID": "RZTAY1D1SSJE0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is good alarm system. the following is my thoughts why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.When you activate the alarm in home mode, the delay zone still have to wait 10 sec to be activated which I think it doesn't make sense.

It has all the features you will ever need, it works and Michael will promptly provide any support you may need.The details: This product met my criteria for a security system that I could install and manage without being anchored to a security company with monthly fees and continuous sales pitches.  I installed the SO2-B in a two story 2900 sq. ft. home where the furthest window sensor is a level below and about 50 feet from the control unit. No problems with the wireless signal reaching the control unit or the remotes/panic button reaching the control unit from anywhere.  As has been mentioned, the sensors are all pre-programmed and ready to go. This is truly a plug-and-play system.  Just program your phone number/s of choice and record an outgoing phone message and you're done. Tip: download the manual from the Fortress Security Store Website. It is a more logical representation of the  system than the documents included in the box. FYI, I get my internet service via DSL from my phone company. So that internet signal is being carried on the phone line along with voice service. This has caused no problem with the phone feature of the SO2-B.  So from the other reviews and my experience it seems like this system will utilize most any phone system you may have.  This system is a great value for under $200. Sure, you can get more features/options with more expensive systems but with 10 sensors and 3 motion detectors I have secured all the really vulnerable access points to my home. Wirelessly. And it calls my cell phone in the event of a sensor being tripped. But most importantly, Fortress Security Store is not a sell-it and forget-it storefront. Without service even a good product can be made less than optimal. Michael at Fortress is available and responsive and will make sure you get the most out of your purchase.

When it arrived, I opened it to find only a piece of paper that serves as the Quick-Start Guide.  This is less than helpful.  No  manual.  No idea how to set up a code, whether I'm SUPPOSED to set up a code, how to work the panel, etc.  I've contacted the company to get more information, with the understanding it may take \"24 hours\" for a response.  It has now been SEVENTY-TWO hours with no response.  I don't understand why I'm not getting the great customer service the rest of you have had, but I'm ready to send it back!Update: after my review, I received MULTIPLE emails from Michael.  It was a lot to muddle through, and it wasted quite a bit of my time.  A revised manual was put on the website AFTER I spent so much time trying to find it.  He also took it upon himself to call me several times even though I never gave him my phone number.  I know some people might consider this good customer service, but I found it annoying.  Someone tried to break into my house on July 7th, which is why I ordered this system.  It is now the 21st and I still don't have it hooked up because I just found time to muddle through this manual, which is FULL of grammar & spelling errors.  One of my sensors has already fallen off the window.  I don't know when I'll get it set up, because apparently I have to drill holes through my walls & the house itself in order to get the siren set up.  This is WAY more trouble than I thought it would be.  I think the system ITSELF will work fine once it's set up.  I tested it out the other day and the alarm is so loud it nearly gave me a heart attack.  I'm very concerned these sensors are going to continue falling off my windows.Michael did agree to send me 2 more sensors that I needed at no charge, which was nice.Final Update.  Returned it.

I purchased it from Mike at Fortress Security and the only thing better than the system is his customer service. You send him an email, he responds. You call him, he answers the phone. You have a stupid question, he answers it quickly and professionally. The system arrived super fast - even from across the country. The directions aren't the best but if you read them a couple of times you can figure them out. When I was at a loss, I called Mike and 5 minutes later was up and running. I was looking for a decent alarm without the monthly monitoring fees and this baby does the trick. The tiny alarm that comes with it is LOUD - a good thing. Instead of using the tape to mount the wireless detectors, I recommend velcro or super glue. Trust me - you don't want to hear this alarm in the middle of the night because a sensor fell off. So far no false alarms and it's so easy to arm/disarm, especially with the remotes.", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best", "Author": "ara", "ReviewID": "RSS8UO028JUQQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the bet product, easy to install and with a very fantastic costumer help by phone, very friendly and very helpful.

One month later, another false alarm, another motion sensor stuck on. Disable it. Another month later alarm goes off. I think \"another stuck sensor\" so I dont worry too much except for this time someone has really broken into my house and taken $6500 worth of stuff. You cant have an unreliable security system otherwise you wont know when its real. I got ADT now. No false alarms ever, plus now they offer cameras.

It does not even say, what type of battery to use. Some weird type of battery, I never heard of, when I opened one unit. I don't even know where you get this battery. You can get this sensors at 99 cent store, instead of paying so much. There is no instructions in the booklet on how to set up the key pad, codes and how to operate the alarm system. When I purchased it, Mike was very sweet talker and told me that he will walk me through when programming the system but after he got paid, he doe snot answer the phone, does not reply e-mails or return calls. I have this system sitting for two months and I don't know what to do with it.He only gives one week to return and by that time, you just get it in the mail. So, this is cheating.
