I had it out of the box and connected to my computer in about 15 minutes.I struggled with how to set it up to view away from the home, which is why I wanted the camera.A call to support-10-15 minute wait- was all it took. They came in via gotomeeting or something like that, executed the correct settings within 5 minutes and I was up and running.The picture is good in daylight, good indoors at night with only the cameras led lights. It does not do well thru a window into the backyard at night. I would have been surprised if it did do a good job under those conditions.However, once I installed an exterior motion light, the camera works great.I highly recommend the camera and swanns tech support.", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "OK for the Money", "Author": "DJ \"DJ\"", "ReviewID": "R11E1JA58QPSVU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is pretty good for the price. I use it to watch out my front window. At night, if using behind a window, you will have to turn off the IR mode and just turn up the brightness setting and hope you have a streetlight within 30 to 50 feet. The window will just reflect the IR back at the camera and mask out the picture. If using outside or indoor monitoring, the IR is perfect. Software is a little glitchy when trying to use Internet Explorer. The activex control will not install for some reason. Tried Windows XP, 7, 8.1 and IE 8, 10, & 11 with no success so far. Tech support was not able to help me get this to work. There response after trying some things was it will not work in IE. LOL! I was able to setup port forwarding and DDNS for my static IP address. Viewing in Firefox over the Internet is working OK. IE has a few more tools like Grid View and Record that is not supported in Firefox. I also downloaded another version of their software for ADS-440 but cannot get it to work at all with my camera. Tech support was not able to resolve my problem. Hopefully the Pan and Tilt gears will last for years and not fail like my 44X Vanguard did. I had 3 Vanguards and all broke the same way. These were $300+ cameras with excellent picture quality but horrible durability. Hope the Swann product has a better track record. If you are not computer/router savvy, you may find difficulty in setting this up on your own. I recommend setting up several Pan and Tilt presets to expedite Panning the Camera. Presets help with avoiding latency issues in the Pan and Tilt command. To avoid using all of your bandwidth adjust the Framerate to a low number.I was able to get email and ftp to work. I have the camera setup to FTP a snapshot every five minutes to my PC. It can also email you a notice when the motion detection is triggered but this was not working well for me through a window.Edit: 01-23-14Just had to bump my rating up to 4 *s. I was finally able to get the ActiveX to work in Internet Explorer with no help from tech support. I had to run the \"SwannEye Search Tool.exe\" again that comes on the DVD and run an update (F4) to the camera, which must have updated the firmware with the correct ActiveX Control. This now allows IE to find the correct OCX and install it for IE to work with the IP Camera. Now I have all of the functionality that was intended.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Picture, Horrible sound", "Author": "Rich", "ReviewID": "R1ZMKGR8SVIT9G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Better video quality than the Dlink cameras I have (all are SD video, Not HD).  However the mic is useless when trying to view the camera on my smartphone.

If you are not a tech person, I would not recommend this product.Why did this not get more than 2 stars?Product manual lacks information. For those who are not technical, you will have a lot of difficulty setting this up.Browser UI is horrible. IE is recommended, but IE has since gone through several updates. Not all functionality is available. Using other browsers (Chrome & FireFox), not all functionality is available. Searching the swann website, no update is available; although there is an upload option to update it. Camera control is horrible. If want want to make a slight tweak in the position, good luck. There is no option to go a little left, right, up or down. There is another camera control option which may as well just say move me at random.FTP cannot be setup. Constantly fails. FTP details are correct. No documentation or website info.Email cannot be setup. Fails. Email details verified. Tried gmail and yahoo. No documentation to troubleshoot.Very frustrating. Not sure if I will buy from Swann again.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "Norm N. \"Norm N.\"", "ReviewID": "R11MQCTOCC3NGI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had this camera for about 3 weeks now.

I'm OK with geeky stuff but I gave up after 4 hours of trying. You need your own IT department to make this work.

Learned quick the book only tells 'what' and not 'how'.  Since I already know the 'what' from the computer screen, I joined the LogMeIn chat/tech support.  The first guy zipped through a bunch of stuff and got the camera working.  Next day I had tech try and assist with setting up the email notification and they failed.  Following day, tried again and after 45 minutes, they got it, with my assistance!  Then they indicated that there is NO offsite storage of video unless I supply the ftp site.  All the images are normally routed to the computer.  Thus, it means I have to leave my computer turned on, and a static IP address, and if someone were to break in and steal the computer, then there'd be no video to look at.Now looking into FTP sites.  All in all, I'm pretty disgruntled with the tech support, instruction book, clarity of software, and overall experience.  Oh yeah, and the active camera view tends to lock up and I have to hard-reboot the computer.  Very frustrating.  They could do a LOT better.", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Scheduling doesn't work", "Author": "Michael Goodman", "ReviewID": "R15Y1DLIHHOT7R", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Pretty bad video quality, but better than some other options.
