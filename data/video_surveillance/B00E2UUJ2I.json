After all, if you put it up high enough, how would anyone know if is was a real camera or not and if they were a criminal, they should be afraid to approach a house with this on the front. This camera looks just like the real deal, and you don't have to worry about all the recordings or cost of monitoring.I bought the first camera for the front of the house, but I am seriously thinking about a second one for the side of the house where we keep our trash cans. This is a really smart and cost effective security item. I highly recommend it.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "This won't fool anyone.", "Author": "NY Shopper", "ReviewID": "RB0J0M8APDARE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First of all this thing needs an On/off switch to stop the blinking red light during the daylight hours. Having the light working during the day only kills the battery life.  If I left it mounted up high as I did was I supposed to climb a ladder every day to turn off the light by pulling off the cover and removing the batteries? Yes, I knew there was no on/off switch before I bought it but I bought it anyway. I had it mounted outside over my front door entrance at first and now it resides in my closet, on a shelf, in the box and that's where it stays. No self-respecting burglar (if there is such a thing) would be fooled by this dummy camera. I\"m the dummy for buying it. It looked much better on screen then it does when you're holding it in your hands. My best advice is lock your doors and windows at night and you'll be much safer then putting up this \"toy\" camera.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "pops", "Author": "melissa", "ReviewID": "R25XDFNMFKVQWQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "pops seems to like it alot..the location and design of his back yard is perfect for this camera and if anything, keeps a little peace of mind with him  :)", "Date": "October 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love the real look.Good one!", "Author": "Magic Man", "ReviewID": "RRLLD13F6UUIU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was searching for quite while to get something that it looks and feels real to install for my storage area, and there you go; I found this ineradicable camera 9 out of 10 could't tells this is a fake camera. That's made me happy more, and I am about to order two or three more to install all around my house also.

I dont want anyone even coming near my garage so i mounted it up high.  it is visible from teh street but set back about 50 ft.  and looks real,  I figure if i still have people coming into my yard now,  theyre going to come in anyway.  :-)over all very very happy with it.  I only gave it a 4 star rating as it would not be good for close up applications,  if you cannot mount it up high, and have atleast 30 ft or more distance from first observation,  this might not be the camera for you,highly recommend for anyone that needs a dummy camera,  and their mounting needs exceed 30ft from first eye contanct,  and they have the ability to mount atleast 10ft off the ground.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice decoy cam", "Author": "joe", "ReviewID": "R1KO6YB4SEFADQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "good easy to install deterrent.....nice decoy for the real camera... had it installed in about 2 minutes... review needed 3 more words...", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$39.95", "Features": "Realistic Appearance intruders cannot detect the difference to the real cameras\nVideo cable gives impression of wired surveillance system\nQuick and Easy Installation using the wall plugs and screws provided\nEasy Angle Adjustment\nSturdy Mounting Bracket", "Name": "Dummy Security Camera-Secure your Property Fast!Security Cameras Instantly Protect your Home and Family use this Realistic Imitation Fake Home Surveillance System-Outdoor Wireless Video Security CCTV-Infrared Blinking Light with 365 Day Guarantee", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41pi5QgynnL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00E2UUJ2I"}}
