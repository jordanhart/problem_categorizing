I have been shopping around for the \"perfect\" monitor for months buying and returning until I have found what I want. (My son is 6 months old) I have tried several brands/types of video monitors such as Sony, Summer Infant monitors, and a Costco brand that can be used via the internet and Iphone/Ipad2. This Motorola monitor is the BEST that I have found. Money was not an issue for me as I wanted a video/audio monitor that just worked well. I do recommend spending a little more and buying the 3.5 inch monitor.Ok, what to say that has not been covered in other positive posts.....The resolution at night is awesome as I can see my baby breathing. (VERY important) I can see everything in great detail. The camera views best when mounted on the wall close to the crib-this way it can scan straight down and straight up viewing the entire crib and room. I originally placed it on a \"wall shelf\" but when I scanned down I could see a bit of the shelf instead of the entire crib. Also important when you have a child that rolls all over the crib as they sleep! You need to see every inch of the crib. (On the back of the camera is a tiny hole to hang on a nail or screw.) I hung mine on my wall just above a shelf and to blend it in I placed stuffed animals on either side-very nice looking and discreet. I painted the white cord to match the wall to blend it in. When scanning from the monitor it makes absolutely no noise and doesn't wake the baby. The sound is great!I am a light sleeper and wake at his every roll and whimper at night. I used to get NO sleep. With this monitor I can put the volume up loud to hear every little move or put the volume down low to only wake when he cries loudly. The monitor has a light indicator on top to inform you of the \"loudness\" of the baby's cry. Also, I live in a two story home with wireless everything (my house is Grand Central with all the wireless technology.) and this monitor does great with cell phone, wireless router, and computer reception. There is no interference at all. The battery on the monitor, when fully charged, lasts 8 to 10 hours but I recommend it plugged in to the power cord at night. There is no delay. What you see is what is happening, allowing you to get to your baby fast!The only thing I would add is a clip to the monitor to be able to strap it to you and the time. Sometimes I like to know what time it is for feeding purposes. Awsome monitor and well worth the money as now I finally get some sleep and peace of mind at night!!!Update****02/16/13I have now owned this monitor for year or so, and have recently encountered more problems.- The night vision on one of the cameras has. I can barely see my son anymore, and if he didn't have dark hair, I am not sure I would even know where he was in the crib.- The battery life of the parent unit is also dying. It used to hold a charge for about 5 hours, and now the charge lasts maybe 1 hour.", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best monitor on the market", "Author": "J. D. Robinson \"KnottyMonkey\"", "ReviewID": "R1X3OOKFFZ4H1N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This monitor is amazing.  Over the last 3 and a half years I have bought and returned probably 5 monitors.  We ended up with a Summer monitor for the first 2.5 years, then it finally broke and replaced it with a Summer Bestview.  The only problem is that model (bought in January 2011) is discontinued and with a second baby on the way we need a second camera which is no longer available.  I have been researching for weeks now, reading every review on Amazon and other sites and decided to order the Motorola MBP36.When I wrote this review a few weeks ago, a second monitor was not available anywhere.  Although they are not available on Amazon yet (as of 9/1/2011), they are available online at other major baby stores where you \"buy\" stuff for babies (hint hint).  I just ordered one today, which now makes this the perfect monitor.PROS- LCD UnitFirst of all, the LCD screen is huge.  It is 3.5\" diagonally.  For reference, and iPhone is also 3.5\".  The aspect ratio is a bit more square than an iPhone, but you get the idea.  The unit is very thin, its about as thick as a typical men's wallet.  It is lightweight, has a nice kick stand that seems very sturdy and nice, grippy rubber feet on the bottom that are very unobtrusive but work great.  There is an antenna across the top back that can flip up if you need it to get better reception, but we have never needed it, even when two floors away.  There are 4 buttons on each side of the screen, 4 directional that control camera, volume, menu navigation, a menu button, an \"ok\" button, a video on/off button and a microphone button.  They are well placed, it is not a huge problem to have to hit the menu to get to volume, we had to do the same on the Summer Bestview and it is the first menu option (i.e. hit the menu button and it is already in the volume option, so just hit up/down from there).As you can tell from the pictures, the unit has pretty good industrial design too, which seems to be the trend in baby monitors now.  Battery life is decent, it works enough to have a daytime nap and then use it again in the evening without charging in between.  Your not going to get more than 3-4 hours out of it if you use the LCD a lot though.  There is a series of LEDs across the top that indicate how much noise your kids are making, and there is a very accurate temperature display (based on reviews, sounds like Samsung temp is off by 10 degrees, but this unit matches the thermostat outside the room so I'm assuming spot on).- CameraThe ability to scan and pan is great, very quiet and no likely to disrupt your kid.  There is a small green LED on the front of the camera, but you can't see the infrared lights in the dark (unlike our Summer Bestview which looks like 10 little LEDs in the dark).  The zoom is not great, kind of hard to get to on the menu and it is only a digital zoom that crops the center of the picture and doubles it.  It is small and can be placed pretty much anywhere.  The picture that it sends to the handheld unit is great (as far as baby monitors go).  It isn't going to win a technical Oscar, but it is very clear. The huge LCD screen helps.  In daylight it is incredibly crisp and vibrant.  I haven't noticed any interference with WiFi, but haven't really tested either.  It operates at 2.4GHz and we mostly have 5Ghz 802.11n devices, so we are in a different bandwidth that doesn't conflict.If you have additional cameras (up to 4), you can set the monitor to manually scan through them, it will stay on each one for 12 seconds based on what it says in the manual.  You can have up to 4 cameras, but there is no ability to see multiple ones on the the screen at once (like the Lorex).CONSI guess a minor quibble might be that you can't put batteries in the camera, but the old monitor had this functionality and we never used it in 2.5 years so not an issue for me.  One other possible thing worth mentioning is that the monitor unit takes a proprietary battery, very similar to what a lot of cordless phones have.  One other minor thing worth mentioning is that the infrared LEDs at night are not very bright from 10 feet away, we are just going to put a shelf near our 3 year olds bed so that it will be closer (think of the LEDs around the camera as flashlights for night vision).I can say without reservation that this thing deserves 5 stars after a 3 full weeks with it.  My wife loves the size of the screen, the light weight monitor, the portability, ease of use etc.  Its a very cool product.*Update 8/24/2011* minor spelling correction (sales to sails) and added clarifying point in final paragraph \"even though it supports 4 cameras\", which was already mentioned above but needed reiterating.*Update 9/1/2011* Removed comments about additional cameras not being available since I bought one today.

What I expected/wanted from the baby monitors are these:1) Good quality of the screen so I can see my baby (even breathing: chest going up and down at night)2) Easy of use (I just hate anything that is a pain to use)3) Camera pan/zoom option (My baby moves around and I like having camera close to him, so this is a really good feature to have)So, let me explain how those three monitors performed.First one is Motorola Digital Video Baby Monitor with 3.5 Inch Color LCD Screen (At Amazon regular price: 229.99)This one is the winner. It has a good picture quality, zoom in, is really easy to use. That's it. It satisfied all those three categories. Other feature I also liked but not necessary are,, talk back, lullaby (well, kinda useless for my baby). I wish it was made with a little better quality plastic (compared to other two I've tried) and wish it had clock on the screen, which is very helpful at night when the baby wakes up! One thing I noticed though, was that battery of parent unit goes out SO QUICK when it is not plugged in, and use rechargeable battery.Second one is Samsung Wireless Video Security Monitoring System w/ 3.5\" LCD (At Amazon regular price: 179)This one,, sigh... I really wanted to love it... I always trust Samsung quality. and YES, it comes up to that quality standard (both physical material that is made out of, and some great added features) that I look for. BUT there are a few cons that I just could not live with.First of all, this one is LOADED with FEATURES. It has the best quality screen (almost like a digital camera! which is very impressive for a baby monitor! Both day and night time, it showed consistent great quality), talk back, Date/Time, viewable from the computer, etc etc... Just a lot!However what threw me off was that vibration/beep when the parents unit wakes up from the sleep mode. Basically this thing goes to sleep when the baby does not make a sound or makes a sound that's not too alarming. It is trying to give parents some time to sleep unless baby cries so much. HOWEVER, I noticed that it did not pick up small cries that I also wanted to hear. And that VIOLENT vibration would just startle me every time the unit wakes itself from the sleep mode. I almost had heart attack every time it did it. I mean it is VIOLENT vibration. It is way too powerful and hear this, you can not control it, nor you can turn it off. You can either choose between vibration or loud beep, which is also annoying. I guess they did not test this out themselves. If they had a baby, they would know that just sound of a baby crying will wake parents up.Another thing that made me return this unit: lack of zoom and pan feature. OK. I should have read before purchasing this one, but so sad it did not have this feature, while having all other useless ones?! weird.The Last thing I wanna point out on this: freaking annoying to go around the menu and hard to use! This thing is loaded with features (a lot of not so necessary) and but failed to organize it successfully under the menu. Also, it has way too many buttons around the parents unit that I do not think are the \"most-used\" buttons for parents. Once again, did they really test this thing with real parents with real babies?!! It's like having a cell phone, trying to figure out where/what category the feature I want to use might be hidden under. A lot of them were where it did not make sense to me. Basically, very annoying to use.Third one is Summer Infant Best View Handheld Color Video Monitor (At Amazon regular price: 199.99)I had a high hope for this one, as I heard good things about Summer Infant baby monitors. I will make it short. It has the best \"Ease of use\" amongst all three. The parents unit had buttons (shapes and placements) that made most sense out of three I've tried. Plastic (or any other material that were used) quality was great. It does not have bells and whistles as other ones, such as talk back, lullaby, etc etc. It also has zoom in/panning feature that is very helpful.BUT, this is why I returned this thing: the BAD, BAD, I mean BAAAAAAAAAAAD screen quality, especially at night. It made my baby look like those \"ghost pictures\" people take. Like those grainy pictures that people claim that they have captured the ghost in the picture... Get what I mean? It is super grainy I could not recognize my own baby's face! My baby's face filled up the whole screen (I'm saying this to say that I did not have the camera far from my baby) but still I had to guess, oh those two black blobs would be his eyes.. and another one below them is his nose?? no,, mouth??? Yes, basically, if you are looking for a baby monitor with a screen, why would you waste money on a screen that is useless? Move onto other monitors.Finally, after using three, I realized that Motorolla had to be the winner, and I've been using it over a month and very pleased with it.

Well buying this product has been a really bad experience in terms of customer service.  First of all, I did a lot of research on baby monitors and thought this monitor would be great for us.  At first it was, but after only a few months the level of clarity diminished and before I returned it the night camera failed completely.  I understand some times there are defective products out there, mine was one.  But what really angers me is the time it took for Motorola to get back to me when I told them what my camera was doing.  From the time I contacted them about the defective monitor it took 4 days for someone to respond, in turn that person turned me over to another person and it took an additional 5 days for that person to contact me. Since it was taking so long through email I called them to try and expedite this, since I felt having a functional monitor again was very important to me and for the safety of my baby.  I spoke with a Motorola agent and they said I would have a return number in a couple hours and it took almost another day to get that just so I could mail out my defective monitor.  On top of that I had to pay shipping just to send it back.  Many companies I know allow me to print a return label online and they cover return fees. I am still waiting on my replacement almost a week after they received it and I had to contact them again just to make sure they had it because the tracking number said it was delivered.  Don't you think they would of let me know that they received it and had given me a delivery date?  This is a baby monitor, this is a product that is used for safety and monitoring the well being of your baby, you would think this process would be a little faster and urgent?  I am so disgusted with Motorola that I will never, ever buy another product from them.  I want to let customers know what I experienced so they don't have the same experience I had.Update:  I am still waiting for a response from Motorola 11 days after they received my defective baby monitor on June 15th.  I've sent numerous emails and even called and no one has told me the status of when I should get the monitor.  I left a message with a team leader and I have yet to hear back.  This is unacceptable Motorola.Update:  I finally received my new replacement baby monitor on July 2nd. I initially sent an email May 29th regarding my issue, so we are talking over a month before I received my replacement baby monitor.  That's unacceptable and I just wan't consumers to know about my experience, and I hope it doesn't happen to you.  I wish I could do something about it, companies need to be held accountable for such poor service or practices.  Another thing that bothers me is that I actually paid for shipping to send it and not once did Motorola say they were sorry for the delay or say they would take care of the shipping costs.  Motorola lost a customer for life and I will make sure and tell as many people as I can about my experience.Update:  Greg Reichman VP of Sales contacted me because of my frustration and experience I had in getting a new monitor.  I was pleasantly surprised when he offered to send me another camera at no charge.  This is definitely a good gesture that will help get Motorola back in my good graces.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Minutiae of 2 Monitors: Motorola MBP36 & Summer Infant Touch", "Author": "M Baker", "ReviewID": "R3G43YMCBR6YDW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Minutiae of 2 Monitors: Motorola MBP36 & Summer Infant TouchMotorola Digital Video Baby Monitor with 3.5 Inch Color LCD ScreenSummer Infant Baby Touch Digital Color Video MonitorThis review discusses the minutiae, good and bad, of both monitors. (Same review under both products).Summary: Motorola: 4 stars, SI: 4.5 stars. Both monitors are great and fit the bill for a pan/tilt monitor. It's the little details and personal preference that will determine the best monitor for you. FYI, we come from a history of owning the Summer Infant BestView-pre2011. We would have just added a 2nd camera to our unit if it were still available. Where applicable, we noted where SI has improved some things from the BestView to the Touch.Both monitors have a 3.5\" screen. The pictures in both daytime and night vision are very good. The sound and talk back on both units is good. The pan/tilt is quiet overall on both cameras. The biggest difference is how to access the features you feel are most important to you. Below are some notable differences between the two units.Overall layout (see labeled pictures):Video On/Off: external button on bothVolume: in menu on Motorola, dedicated top toggle on SIPan/Tilt: external (Left) buttons on Motorola, in a menu with touch arrows on SIZoom: in a menu on bothScan: external button on Motorola, in a menu on SIButtons: SI wins this hands down. Unless you are awake every time you use the monitor, you cannot easily find and press the correct button, one-handed, in a dark room/semi-sleep state. For us, this design difference is what sealed the deal for SI over Motorola. We can easily find the Video On/Off and volume with tactile sense. We would have resorted to making a raised surface on the 3rd button if we chose to keep the Motorola.SI touch screen: Many people commented that you can brush up against the screen anywhere and turn the menu on/select items. This doesn't seem to be totally the case. You not only have to have the video ON, but you also have to press on the very right or bottom strip of the picture/screen to bring up the menu. A random touch anywhere on the screen will not bring the menu up. Also of note, accessing the main functions (Video On/Off and Volume) does not require the touch menu since these buttons are located on the OUTSIDE of the unit. We are fine with going into a menu for less-common functions such as pan/zoom/scan because we will not be doing this nearly as often as turning the video on/off and adjusting volume. (And the SI volume toggle does NOT activate the touch screen so the monitor can stay dark while you adjust volume.)Interference: we had problems with our old SI (BestView) and wireless interference. The Motorola had much less interference than the SI Touch, the SI Touch seemed to have the same interference as the SI BestView. We opted to upgrade/change routers to solve this problem instead of compromising on any monitors. A router is a cheaper electronic piece to swap out than a monitor system (esp with multiple cameras).Camera range: we placed each camera on the same peg over the bed. The SI showed \u00be of the bed, the Motorola showed a little less than \u00bd. For us that meant HAVING TO pan the Motorola each time to see where baby rolled. We have the camera at the max height on the wall. The camera could easily be placed at a different angle relative to the bed to avoid panning. This is just to compare how the video outputs differ relative to each other. (The specs are undoubtedly written in the manuals somewhere describing the camera lens type.)Night vision LEDs: both the Motorola and SI Touch have 'invisible' LED lights to provide night vision. On the monitors, this looks like a spotlight with darker edges that look like they're `in the shade.' This is subtle and not really noticeable except at the lowest screen brightness setting. For reference, the old SI BestView had a circle of red LED lights around the lens that resulted in a more evenly-lit monitor picture.Speaker: located in the back of the unit on the Motorola. The SI speaker is redesigned but still on the front of the monitor. Both units have an 8-level sound bar and each level between the 2 brands seems about equal. Several have been concerned that the volume does NOT go to zero on the Motorola. However, the speaker is on the back of the unit and makes the lowest setting almost equivalent to a mute setting. In testing it, we found that the rear speaker placement helped block the background rustling/movement that we didn't want to hear, but did not hinder us hearing the louder baby noises that we did want to hear. (Also for comparison's sake, the Motorola and SI Touch level 4 is equivalent to SI BestView level 2 so there is improved ability to adjust the lower/quieter sound levels; the quiet sounds are quieter and loud sounds (above level 4) are still loud. ...a great change for SI fans.Cameras: The Motorola has nice rubber feet at the base that keep the camera from sliding where placed. The SI has a light plastic feel and the base is so light it feels like the camera will topple over. (But it doesn't.) We put ours on the wall (not on a shelf) since that's the best way for us to use the pan/tilt, so the padded bottom is a non-issue (although the SI vibration against the wall was loud until we placed a felt pad sticker on it).Monitors: The Motorola monitor also has the nice rubber grips on the bottom. It stays in place on a tabletop making it easier for you to grab. And you WILL need to grab it...with BOTH hands...in order to press the correct button(s) to activate any function. The SI comes with a little saucer-like magnetic recharging base. It's so light and plastic-y that it hangs on to the monitor when trying to break the magnetic connection. Because you need adequate pressure for the touch screen, you'll need to get your hands on the monitor to work the touch screen functions. Put the fancy saucer base in the trash and just use the charger port on the left side of the monitor unit itself. Overall, the Motorola is a niiiice monitor to hold. It's thick and chunky, like a portable game unit (think psp), and you can thumb the left and right buttons very, very easily. The SI is thinner and more sleek (fake chrome cover) and less comfortable to hold. And because you need to hold it length-wise (buttons on the top of the unit get in the way...), it's a little harder to balance than a touch phone that you may be used to holding.The SI comes with a cordless click-on base for the camera. It takes 4 AA batteries, advertising a 10hr battery life. The batteries do NOT come with the unit and we think that you CANNOT use the power cord to charge the base, eg rechargeable batteries need to be taken out of the unit to be recharged. This is different than stated on the Amazon description. We have not tested this, but it's directly from the manufacturer info.Motorola has a temp gauge. Never had it before and it's a nice feature to have. The temp of the Motorola is accurate since the camera doesn't run hot (goes up a few degrees temporarily when you move the camera) unlike reviews of other brands.Motorola has an audible beep when the battery is low. Most people like this. We do not. A flashing light is adequate. We'd be pissed if this woke us up in the night, so any monitor stays plugged in during the overnight hours for this reason. (Plus the manufacturer recommends running the battery down during the day and charging at night to keep the battery life optimal.)SI turns the video off in 3min if not plugged in. Motorola takes longer by about 1-1.5min.Again, both units are great for a pan/tilt multi-camera setup. What you're used to in a monitor and what makes life easier for you in daily use will tip your scales one way or the other. But you cannot go wrong with either of these choices. We hope these little itty bitty details of these two units help someone.*UPDATE* 11/10/11 We really wanted to like the Motorola because it had a more compact and nicer camera and the monitor design was superior to SI and had a great feel to it, but the accessibility of some features won out on the SI vs the Motorola. We've had the SI monitor for a month now and everything is still behaving. The only thing to add to the above information for the SI is that the touch screen is a little better than expected. As stated above, it is activated only if you push the menu button on the right side of the unit (very inconvenient location for one-handed use) or tap along the bottom/right of the touchscreen (like old-school digital picture frames). The nice thing is that once activated, the screen is very responsive to one-handed touch when sitting upright (eg on a nightstand). It's very easy to reach over and adjust brightness or use the arrow buttons with one finger and not knock it over. The only negative is in selecting items. Once you select the menu item (eg Brightness or Camera), you need to use the arrow buttons in the popup menu to get to and highlight what you want. For example, under Brightness you cannot just tap a higher level and have it go from 2 to 7. Instead, you have to tap the arrow up incrementally. The menu items of Brightness, Scan, and Switch Camera do this. (FYI in comparison, the Motorola has the same menu system but instead of tapping on the initial menu icon you needed to arrow thru all the menu icons to get to what you want. As mentioned in the original review, the VOLUME was one of these embedded menu items so it took 3-4 button clicks to adjust volume once you pulled up the menu.) Too bad these two monitoring systems can't have a child and make the PERFECT user-friendly system.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Stay away - reliability issues and horrible warranty replacement shipping", "Author": "UVABigM", "ReviewID": "RW1XCTIUOKZ1Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We received this as a baby shower gift and loved it while it worked. For the $250 this costs the reliability of this monitor has been a major problem.We ended up exchanging the first one within a month of receiving it because the sound stopped working. The replacement unit worked for about 9 months before the sound on that went out as well.I contacted Motorola and they had no problem sending out a replacement unit, but turnaround times are 1 week + with a receipt and 3 weeks + without a receipt. It seems like this is a fairly common problem related to faulty wiring within the parent unit. For something in this price range it is unacceptable and ridiculous that a warranty replacement take this long. A working and reliable baby monitor is critical.We ended up buying an Infant Optics DXR-8 since we couldn't wait. So far it has been excellent. From what I can tell the menu structure on the parent unit is almost identical to the Motorola. If you didn't know your were using the Infant Optics you would think it was the MB36. The display on the infant optics seems to be much sharper and the overall build quality seems better. The micro USB charging port on the parent unit is a big plus. We can use any of the other cell phone and tablet chargers we have.I would stay away from the Motorola and consider the Infant Optics DXR-8 instead.---Update - 19 days since calling---Called Motorola for an update and was told I should be receiving the replacement tomorrow. I informed the rep that I was unsatisfied by the time it has taken and feel it unacceptable for it to take so long to replace a $250 monitor that most parents would find difficult to be without. The rep was nice enough to inform me that it is only meant to be a tool and I shouldn't be relying on it to monitor my baby. The rep also informed me that they are the only office in the country that handles returns for the US and Canada and are extremely busy and she didn't see a problem with it taking this long.Definitely would recommend staying away and spending your money on something else.

The pan/ tilt function worked brilliantly3.  Good battery lifeCons:1. The previous version of this monitor (the MBP 30) had voice activation (VOX). Motorola decided to remove the technology for the new version.  VOX is a very basic feature of higher end monitors and was a MUST for me.2. Feel like turning the volume up a notch int he middle of the night? Too bad. You can't adjust the volume without navigating through the internal menu, thus you have to turn on a light in your bedroom (the buttons are not back lit) and thumb through several screens. Try doing that at 4 AM.  No thanks.3.  The screen stopped transmitting images on night 2.  You see, the unit has a screen saver function when the battery is in use, where the screen goes black.  One time the screen blacked out,  and never went back.  I have unplugged/ replugged the unit, taken out the battery, pushed every damn button.  It just stopped working.Honestly, if Motorola added VOX to this monitor, and fixed a few glitches, it could corner the market.  The quality of the video blew those non tech co monitors (Levana, Summers Infant, Mobi) out of the water.

However, I am soooo frustrated with the placement of the two-way communication button.  As I mentioned in my original review, the button that allows you to talk into the camera is located on the main display and right under the view button.  After having several incidents of either myself mistakenly pushing that #!%?! button and thus waking the baby because he suddenly hears our voices, noise, etc., I have to say this would have probably been a deal-breaker if we had known this before purchasing this monitor.  It is so easy to accidentally hit that stupid button (via putting monitor in back pocket; trying to locate view button in middle-of-night, etc.) that it has become a real issue in our household.  In fact right now, I have to go and get a screaming baby that was abruptly awoken from a nap due to a curious preschooler who got her hands on the monitor and was trying to \"see\" her baby brother... *SIGH*  Just a thought to put in your considerations before buying this..._______________________________________________________________After kiddo #2, I did a lot of research before purchasing another video monitor.  Our first (Safety 1st True View) was lacking in many, many ways, so I wanted to make sure the next monitor got us the most bang-for-our-buck, as they say.First the PROS of this unit:- Nice big screen -- it really is wonderful as you can see everything!- The pan/tilt feature is awesome!  Kids move around when they sleep.  Kids move around in their room.  Enough said, right?- Control buttons pretty intuitive (but poorly situated -- read cons).- Sound quality is great.- Picture quality is fantastic, both day AND night vision.  I know others have said they thought the night vision was terrible, but both of our kids have dark, dark rooms with blackout curtains, and I can see every blink of the eyes and breath that they take at night.- Temperature feature helpful, but I am not sure it is accurate.  Nonetheless, it give me a good idea if their rooms are too hot or cold.  Our kids' rooms have much more drastic temperature issues that the rest of our house as they sit over our garage, so this feature has been nice.- The battery life is pretty good -- it usually lasts about 4 hours.- The camera and parent unit lights are really dim -- in our experience, it does not light up the whole room and is barely noticeable.  No more spotlights on babies!  Nice.- If you have two cameras, it is very easy to toggle from one to the other using only one button.  This button also allows you to set it to \"Scan Mode\" where every 12 sec. the screen will show each room cyclically.- Rubber grips on the stand and parent unit so that it doesn't slide around or fall off.- Long A/C adapter cord -- this can be both a pro and con -- pro in that it has a great reach from any outlet; con in that I trip on it all the time when I am moving the monitor to another room...the cord is SO LONG!All those Pros being said, Motorola left out some very BASIC features, and some of the included ones are useless.  My family calls me the Queen of Complaints, but whatever. Here are the Cons:- There are NO back lights to the parent unit.  And while this makes it really dim (a plus), it is terrible when you have been awakened in the middle of the night and are trying in vain to find the view button, but instead are accidentally panning the entire room, or pushing the two-way communication button so the baby hears scrambling around (Arrrrg!).  Seriously, Motorola???  This seems like a no-brainer feature to add.  They should have a back light that is activated by touch, much like cell phones have.- There is no way to turn the volume completely off.  So, what is the point of having the noise level LED lights???  You can HEAR the noise level your baby/kid since they give you no choice not to.  This stinks when you are trying to sleep, but your kid has a cough; or baby is fussing-it-out a bit; or you are trying to actually watch a movie with your spouse after the kiddos are down.- Which brings me to the next basic feature Motorola left out: Voice Activation!  They should have let you turn off the volume to the unit, but program voice activation if baby lets out a blood curdling scream, or whatnot.  I also wish that they had a voice activation feature for the multiple cameras, so that the parent unit would automatically focus on the room where a kid was crying.  Instead, you have to have it on that 12-sec scan cycle, and it is really annoying to hear the different \"sound\" of each room repeatedly.- Also regarding the volume: you have to manually enter into the menu in order to adjust the level. Too time consuming for such a simple function.  A volume control should be on the side of the unit for quick access (with the ability to turn the volume completely down!!!)- As I mentioned before, the two-way communication button is on the main display -- this can easily be accidentally hit, causing your kid to hear you when you don't want them to.  This feature should have been on the menu, not the main options.  Also, if you are in Scan Mode and are using the two-way communication for one room, it will still switch to the other room causing your other kid to abruptly hear your voice and possibly wake up. (!!!)- (BTW, the two-way communication is terrible.  I tried it a couple of times when my husband was in my daughter's room, and he said he couldn't even tell what I was saying and it sounded freaky.  Nice.)- An alarm feature?  Why would you want that on a monitor? I want my baby to SLEEP.  Sheesh.- The on/off button is practically microscopic.  I have very small fingers and it takes me a couple of tries to get the unit off/on.  Not a huge deal, but annoying.So, all-in-all, a great monitor with great quality sound and visual, but Motorola amazingly left off some very basic, basic features that would have made this monitor the King of All Monitors.

After comparing the new Summer Infant Touch and the Motorola, I opted for this one due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews. So far, so good!What I like:Pretty much what others have said here. The picture quality is excellent. I can only compare this to our last video monitor which had a tiny screen and which I thought actually had a pretty decent picture and I still say this is an amazing quality image. I did have to get used to the slight delay that comes with the digital monitor but that would be the case with any of the other monitors currently on the market, I think.The sound monitoring is also great. We run a lot of white noise in our daughter's room (a fan and Marpac white noise machine and in the summer, a window A/C unit on top of both of those) and with our last Summer Infant the white noise was picked up in droves, making the audio quite unpleasant to keep on at night. We often used another monitor just for sound. Now we can finally use one monitor for all our needs and we can hear the baby over the other din in her room without annoying background noise or static.What I don't like:So far, not much. The one thing that others have mentioned that I also am not a big fan of is the volume control. I do really think that for ease of use having volume control as part of the on-screen menu rather than as a side dial is not a great idea. I think once I get used to it it won't be such a big deal (it really is only two extra steps than what I was used to). Also, I'd really like the option to turn the volume completely off. We live in a very small house and during the day when I'm working on my computer and the baby's sleeping, I keep the video on and don't really have a need for the audio. And yes, the volume dialed down to the lowest setting still does enable a fair amount of noise to get through.

Got stuck permanently on, so had to keep it plugged in and on 24/7- The cord. No longer works because it frayed where the plug connects to the cord which essentially rendered the monitor useless because it needs to be plugged in all the time due to above issues.Here's where it gets fun. I called Motorola and they said they would only replace it if it was purchased within the year. So again - this is the most expensive thing we purchased for our child and they only stand behind it for ONE YEAR. So I asked for an authorized repair shop in my area and they said they don't do repairs only replacements. I'm astounded.When it was working, we LOVED this monitor.

After months of research and over 6 different purchases, we decided to stick with this device. The pro's SO outweigh the con's when you actually compare it against its competitors.  Trust me, it's worth the extra money.  Especially if you're a 1st time parent.  Running into the room every 10 minutes, or having incredible anxiety while sleeping is not a way to live.  Actually, it'll be great if we're blessed with a second and possibly third baby since you can have four different cameras hooked up to the parental unit. I wish I could go back in time and return 75% of the products I listed as my \"must have\" items before our 1st child.  I would have literally saved thousands.  This is one of those products that you reflect on and say \"Thank God we bought that\".  The only negative is that the battery won't last for days without a charge.  Guess what, they're all very similar when it comes to this. Try not to overcharge it often which will save the battery life, however, you can have the battery replaced easily at a small cost.  We simply plug it in at night when we go to bed and it'll stay on while charging up for the next day.  Turn it off when you're not using it and it'll last 8-10 hours throughout the day. The cameras are fantastic with super clarity, zoom in/out capabilities, ability to talk to your baby from the remote, play an assortment of songs/lullabies, set feeding times, see the room temperature, turn the volume up very loud or down to mute, remotely move the camera up and down and side to side with great visibility, and the night vision is by far the best I researched and seen on the market.  It's also the perfect size which allows you to tuck it in your pocket and takes up little room on the night stand.  I tried the larger screens, but can honestly say that this is the perfect product, hands down.  I can actually see and hear my princess breathing in her crib in the pitch black. I wish I had someone to sit me down and explain what and what not to buy in the beginning. This would be at the top of the list.  Here's some of the other products that my wife and I believe are the \"must have\" items to purchase in the beginning: A steam bottle warmer(I prefer all of the Dr. Brown's bottles and equipment) but any bottle warmer is huge, contoured changing pad with plenty of cheaper waterproof cloths to lay on top of the changing pad cover(trust me on this one since covers are expensive and you may go through 5+ on any given day, so we bought the American Baby Company Waterproof Sheeting Lap Pads 4 Pack which is super cheap ), velcro swaddle blankets(I love the Halo swaddle me with the velcro strap to keep my escape artist at bay) but the summer infant swaddle me's are great too so get a bunch, Happiest baby on the block DVD(watched this at 4am 3 weeks into having her home and I'm pretty sure it saved my life), Medela freestyle breast pump and hands free bra \"worth it's weight in gold\" says my wife. We have both the freestyle and the advanced and never use the advanced, diaper genie, baby Ddrops 400 IU, a million zipper onsie's(buttons SUCK), a non-battery operated swing since you'll go broke replacing batteries everyday(we love the Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing), large steam cleaner for your bottles, pacifiers, toys ect(The First Years Babypro Sterilizer is awesome), Yoga ball(bounce in front of the TV to entertain them while watching the Baby Einstein DVD's or cartoons), and as many of the orthodontic approved pacifiers as you can get.

At the time of this review, we're setting up a baby room for our second child. We used a very poor quality Graco video monitor with our first child which was no comparison to this monitor in terms of quality.Installing: Easy. I wanted the baby unit wall mounted. Simple, one screw -- holds it in place. Only down side to wall mounting is you have the ugliness of a cord attached to the wall and have to be sure the cord is out of reach of the child. I used a couple of small cord tack-downs that nail into the wall. The unit would easily sit on nearby shelf or dresser, but I find it hard to get a good viewing angle directly into the crib from the positions we had available.Parent Unit User Interface: I consider myself to be pretty tech savvy, and was able to easily get it running with minimal reference to the user manual. I did refer to the manual to make sure I was aware of all the available features, but honestly, could have easily run the unit without any reference to the manual at all. Panning and Zooming the camera from the parent unit is a great feature and done easily. Unit starts up very quickly by pressing the power button. Only wish the power button was a little larger. Also, it would be nice to be able to power the baby unit on/off from the parent unit. You have to move a switch on the baby unit.Parent Unit Picture Quality: Absolutely Great! We will use this unit primarily for peace of mind while the baby naps in dark room or sleeps at night. So, for us, it's all about the night vision. For night vision, the picture is black and white but is very clear with easily discernable features (tested on a teddy bear). The panning seems to have a good range, easily able to pan around the entire crib with the camera mounted a couple feet above the top most edge of the crib.Parent Unit Audio Quality: Very good. Little to no static. When using the lullaby feature on the baby unit, the song plays very loud on the parent unit.Baby Unit: Unlike our previous unit, the night vision lights used on the baby unit do not give off any noticeable light. (Our previous unit had red lights all around the camera). Lullaby sounds pretty good on it, and plays at a reasonable level. The two-way audio worked well with a slight electronic sound to it. Would have been nice to have a vollume level adjustment on the baby unit for the lullaby and parent communication. CORRECTION: Apparently there is a way to do this described in the manual--Thanks Golpher.Other: The two-way communication, port out to TV, and lullaby features are all cool features, but really didn't influence my purchase or evaluation much. I do like that they're doing some encryption on the audio for added security. Also, the ablility to add addional cameras is quite intriguing, but not a feature we will likely use. We did notice that the baby unit did cause some interference with an audio monitor we still use in our other child's room. It just turned out that the locations were right near each other, separated by just a wall. This caused static on the parent unit for the old audio monitor. We believe this will be easily remedied by changing channels on the old unit or just relocating it.Overall, the advertised features on this product seem to work very well. In addition, it has an elegant design, and seems to be well constructed. I would highly recommend this product and can't wait to use it when our new baby arrives.UPDATE!!! Well, our baby has arrived and we began using the monitor. The bad news is that we have a problem with the audio randomly dropping out even when there is known sound that should be coming through. The video still worked, just not the sound. Not sure if this is an interference issue or somthing wrong with the unit we got. We are returning it for a new one and I will post the results when we get it. I read only one other review complaining of the same thing, so it doesn't seem to be a wide spread problem, but somthing people should be aware of.UPDATE 2 The new monitor works great. No audio problems like we had with the first one, and we are still using our other audio monitor at the same time--no interference issues.

Additionally, the microphone was no where near as sensitive as the old Summer monitor... which was a deal breaker for us.Realizing that the newest Summer Infant product wasn't as good as the old, we returned that and got the Summer Infant Complete Coverage video monitor set with the 7\" LCD and the handheld unit.

This is nice and slim and would be so easy to pack for travelling. It has a sturdy arm that flips out on the back to hold it up on a table and you can easily push it down if you need it to lay flat.  Also, there is an AV Out port so you can connect it to your computer or television if you want to.  It does not feel or look cheap to me.Battery: The parent unit has a rechargeable battery.  So every time you plug it in (for me at night on my nightstand) it charges the battery so during the day you can take it around with you and not worry about it being plugged in.  I love that.4 Cameras: You can have up to 4 cameras programmed on this!  I only need two, but that is a pretty awesome feature.Switching Camera Views: The buttons along the right side of the parent unit go in this order; menu, \"ok\" select / camera view toggle, video feed on/off, two-way talk feature (talk to your baby from the parent unit).  The part that I was really pleased with was that there is a feature called \"Scan\" that allows you to swap back and forth between the cameras.  It loops on a rotation that switches automatically every 12 seconds or so.  You just push the \"OK\" button on the parent unit and it goes from camera 1 then push again for camera 2 and push again for \"scan\".  I LOVE it!Pan/Tilt/Zoom: At first I thought there was an actual remote for this.  Thankfully, there's not.  There are 4 arrows along the left side of the parent unit that control whichever camera you happen to be viewing at the time.  AND it pans soooo far!  I can pan the entire length of my daughter room and it's a long room!  I was also surprised with how far you could tilt up and down!  This has been the MOST valuable feature for me as walking up and down the stairs has all but been eliminated unless I NEED to go up there. The zoom feature is accessed through the menu.  It goes up to 2x zoom.  Honestly, I haven't used it because the picture is so clear on it's own, there's no need to.Parent Unit Speaker: My kids are so thrilled with this!  So am I!  It works like a walkie talkie.  You just hold down the microphone button and talk.  You release it to hear the sound coming from them.  I can talk to the kids if they need something without having to trudge upstairs!  I can also tell them that I'm coming if they call for me (so they know I heard them) OR I can tell them to lay down if I see them playing around the room. It's a really wonderful feature.Volume/Brightness/Music/Alarm/Temp.: These are all accessed when you press the \"menu\" button on the parent unit.  They come up along the bottom and you just use the arrows to select what you want.  VOLUME - The volume does not mute, which some one suggested was a negative, but I know me.  If I mute the monitor in the middle of the night, I'll fall right asleep and forget to turn it back on.  So I don't mind that.  BRIGHTNESS - The brightness is a nice feature depending on how dark or bright you keep your child's room with nightlights.  MUSIC - The music was a good idea, however, it is lacking a tad.  Not in the way it works, it has 5 lullabies to choose from.  If you select one, it will play and then turn off.  OR you can put it on a loop so that it plays all the lullabies in succession on repeat and keeps going until you turn it off.  You can also adjust the volume while in the music menu so your baby hears it very softly, or a little louder.  Very nice feature.  My ONLY problem with the music is that they aren't that soothing in my opinion.  They sound more like carnival tunes.  But I haven't used it on a baby yet, so maybe it is soothing to them.  ALARM - This was another feature I didn't know it had.  You can set an alarm on the parent unit that will go off in 2hrs, 4hrs or 6hrs.  I liked this particularly for when your child needs medicine or if you are establishing a breastfeeding routine.  TEMPERATURE - This has been soooo handy in our house!  My son's room heats up and cools down faster than any other room.  Since their rooms are upstairs, it is so much harder to gauge in the middle of the night when my room is a comfortable temperature.  Every camera shows the temperature along the top of the screen at all times.  You can switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit if you want to.Sound/Picture Quality:  The sound is outstanding!  I have used a lot of monitors and all of them are grainy and rough sounding - and loud!!  This one is smooth as silk!  The sound in the room is exactly what you hear through the parent unit.  Also, when my daughter is singing, I can hear every word!  The picture is also fantastic.  It is so clear (compared to ALL other video monitors I've used) at any time of day or night.THE ONLY, ONLY, FLAW I've found in this unit is that it doesn't have the time on it.  I wonder why they didn't add that...seems like a pretty easy thing to program.  Anyway, I would like to be able to see what time it is in the middle of the night if they wake up...or if I need to breastfeed - it's just a nice thing to have handy.  But it would NOT keep me from buying this again.  I adore it!", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Baby monitor is great... Motorola is not so much", "Author": "Andre Viens", "ReviewID": "R1ME7Z64AAJ4V8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We purchased this baby monitor in advance of our first child in early 2012. It is absolutely wonderful to be able to see our son as well as hear him. It is now over a year later, and we are still using it and love it all the same. The product itself is great... while we don't use the lullaby sounds and features, I didn't really purchase it for that. The most important thing is, you can see and hear your child very well.The problems I have had so far is that the power adapter has now crapped out on us twice. The end connector that plugs into the main unit is very delicate and it starts to fray over time. This provides an intermittent connection and the battery does not charge effectively or at all.I contacted Motorola back in February of 2013, right before my warranty had expired and was able to get a replacement. The wait time on that took at least three weeks before I got a replacement, and required me to call back to make sure my claim was still in the system.That one lasted until now, and I called back to explain the short lifespan and if I could get a replacement, or if not, at least be able to purchase one. I was told that it is out of warranty and not covered, and I understood that and if I could purchase a replacement... the response was \"you will need to find one on Amazon or Radio Shack\".I did purchase a universal adapter for it the last time I had an issue and it does not power the unit correctly. It turns the baby monitor on and causes it to freeze up. It's rated for 500mA at 6V, but I'm wondering if it's not providing adequate power.I'm going to try my luck at Radio Shack next time. I have been told that you can buy at least a 500mA or higher mA, and the unit will only draw what it needs, so I was going to try an 800mA Enercell one.UPDATE: Bought the Enercell 800mA 6 Volt adapter at Radio Shack along with an \"A\" adaptaplug, and it is working properly to charge the unit and it's not turning on or freezing or doing anything strange. Hope this helps someone who is also looking for the adapter.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "BEST BABY PRODUCT EVER!!!", "Author": "Chelsea", "ReviewID": "R29S6EZOXMFQUS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "TO THOSE OF YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT PRESSING THE SPEAKER BUTTON INSTEAD OF THE CAMERA BUTTON WHEN IN SLEEP MODE... HAVE YOU TRIED PRESSING ANY OTHER BUTTON??? When my screen in on \"sleep\" mode (the sound is on but the screen is off to save battery) I can press any button to turn it on, so I never have a problem pressing the speaker button. I prefer pressing the menu button cuz its on top, and it doesnt bring up the menu when you're pressing it to just turn on the screen. The instructions also say you have to go to the menu option, select the camera icon, and then you use the aarows to move the camera... that's not true at all. Just press the left, right, up, and down buttons on the screen and it moves it.I highly recommend this camera, it's a bit pricey but worth every cent and will be using it for a few years.In case you have been contemplating buying one, let me give you my review of this one. I have been researching for a couple months because I wanted to get a good one for the right price.The picture is crystal clear both day and night. It does have night vision, and its amazing. I can even see him breathing. You can also adjust the contrast to your liking. It has one dim green light to show that it's on but you can barely see it and the little one doesn't notice it. It has like 8 infrared lights for night vision that do not light up, so the baby doesn't get woken or distracted by anything. I have read some reviews on some other monitors that the infrared lights actually lit up red and the kid would just stare at it all night lol, so I made sure to buy one that didn't.As for the screen, it's 3.5 inches.. it doesn't sound that big but it is. It tells you the temperature of the room, whether it's on day or night vision, how many signal bars you have, which camera you are looking through (you can have 4 cameras), and the battery life. I have 5 bars everywhere in my house and even outside in my yard, and the camera is upstairs in the backroom of my house. It lets you know if you are being close to going out if range. While plugged in the screen can stay on as long as you want. If you unplug it the screen automatically shuts off after 2 minutes and continues to play sound to save battery. You can click any button to turn the screen back on. If you add more cameras you can click a button to pick one of them, to scroll, or you can click the scan button and it switches between them every 12 seconds. It even has an alarm that you can set for 2, 4, or 6 hours to check on, feed, change, give medicine, or wake up from a nap. The unit also has a stand so you can set it down and look at it easily. The cord for both the camera and parent unit is fairly long. I think you can put batteries in the camera but I haven't done that yet. I will though in case of power outages. I wouldn't recommend using batteries full time because that's just one more thing you have to buy batteries for lol. The parent unit has a rechargeable battery.THIS MONITOR DOES LET YOU PAN SIDE TO SIDE, TILT UP AND DOWN, WITH AND ZOOM ALL WITH A TOUCH OF A BUTTON ON THE SCREEN!Now for sound. You can hear as much or as little as you want. If I have it all the way up I can hear him breathing. On almost the highest level of sound I can clearly hear him even move a muscle. I usually keep it right in the middle so I don't hear every little sound keeping me up, but I hear enough. The camera has a speaker on it and the parent unit allows me to play 5 different lullabies (you can either play just one or let it play all 5) and also talk to him through it with just a click of a button! There is no interference or static unless I have the screen right next to the camera, which is never.Set up is a breeze, just plug in, turn on, and you're ready!LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!! WORTH EVERY CENT!Update:I figured out a while ago that you can adjust the loudness of the lullabies that play on the camera in the babies room. When selecting a song hit the okay button and 3 different volume levels will pop up. I was so pleased because it was rather loud and would keep my son up, then I found that and its at the perfect volume now.", "Date": "April 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best monitor out there, some flaws I can live with.", "Author": "L. M.", "ReviewID": "R31JSKP9GKNHKW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update #3:Customer service mailed me a new one with a bonus camera. We really like this monitor compared to the model down (no pan/zoom). Quality and Range is amazing, and we have 3000ft house. Can even get outside quite a ways. Highly recommend! If you can buy it somewhere with an extended warranty, do it.UPDATE #2!! Customer service issues... just like everyone else.Phone call #1 was promising - I can scan/email them the receipt, and within 48 hours they will process my email and send me a new camera with a postage-paid box to return the broken one.Sounded too good to be true, and alas, it was...No email confirmation, so I was a little worried but let it slide. One week later, no camera, no contact.Phone call #2 said yes, my email was processed but they were out of stock. Expecting more cameras in that day and I should have it in 5-7 business days.Phone call #3: One week later, still no camera. Total over 3 weeks later, no camera and Customer service says still out of stock. I asked them to send ANY model in the meantime, and they offered to send me the \"upgraded model\" which is the same thing but with 2nd camera. Supposedly they will overnight it to me and I will have it tomorrow. I'm not holding my breath.UPDATE #1!!! Broken At 6 months!!!Display screen is solid white, and we followed troubleshooting instructions to no avail. Audio still works, except that I can't adjust the volume because you need the screen for that. Don't know why it stopped working, but i don't have high hopes for customer service based on other people's posting... I will probably buy a different monitor now because I can't be without one.Original review (4 stars) :Video:pro - Big screen, great color, great night vision, pans, tilts, zooms. Picture is so clear at night I can see my baby breathing. I never thought i would need the pan/tilt/zoom functions, but i use them ALL the time. Display turns itself off after a few minutes to save battery.con - None!Audio:pro - audio is very sensitive. i can even hear the \"sleep sheep,\" which is actually kinda nice.con - audio is either on or off, whereas some very cheap monitors have voice activation. My baby makes a TON of noise and he is only 2 months old. Yes, I will hear him start to cry, but i also hear him grunting and snorting and farting, etc. I am learning to sleep through this, thanks to the sleep sheep...con #2 - no mute button - this means when the baby cries, and it is my turn to get up, I have to either run with the monitor out of the room, throw it out of the room, or fumble to turn the power off quickly in the dark so I don't wake up my husband. I have mastered the quick-power-turn-off technique.Buttons:pro - large, easy to use, and I am smart enough to remember which button is which in the dark.con - the buttons are not backlit. the display button, which allows me to see the baby, is right next to the one which allows me to talk to the baby. I can imagine someone could press it by accident and wake the baby up. I have not done this yet.con #2 - you can't hit a mute button (see above), instead you have to use the power on/off button. not a huge deal, except the power button is small and flush to the unit. designer didn't realize you would ever want to use it.Battery:Terrible!!! The battery won't last the full night. It starts beeping by morning if I forget to plug it back in. HOWEVER, Since I keep it plugged in on my nightstand, this is not usually a big deal. I wish it came with a 2nd power jack so I could just plug it in downstairs too. I might just search for one now.Distance/Reception:Amazing!! I have a 3000 sq. foot home with really thick walls, on 1/3rd acre. I have no problem doing laundry in the basement while the baby is in a 2nd floor bedroom. We tested it all around our yard, and even out to the street corner. Sure there was a little interference while walking, but as soon as I stopped moving, the picture and audio came right back crystal clear. Highly recommended for this feature alone.Other features:Displays the room temperature (i dont know how accurate this is, but it is definitely close).Allows you to play lullaby music on the other end.

Strong", "ReviewID": "R2XD3DLUZ10GQB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this monitor since 2011 and until 2014, I only used it with one camera.  I have always strongly recommended this monitor to friends but I have recently learned a few things since I added a second camera that I think are worth knowing in advance, things that you can't find out through the typical product descriptions...1) each camera will only link to one parent monitor.  It is pretty clear that you can add cameras to the unit, but it was not clear that you cannot add parent units to the system.  When I had a baby in 2014 I wanted to support two parent units (one for upstairs and one downstairs) so I wouldn't have to carry the monitor around with me so much.  It isn't possible.  if you link a camera to a parent unit, it automatically removes it from the other parent unit.  This is stated in the user manual but I didn't read that before trying... after some frustration about this I resorted to the fact that this is a good thing - it means as long as I can see my kids on my monitor, no one else can (I have the DECT version, not the wi-fi).2) after about 2 years with the original battery, the battery life was noticeably shorter.  It would run out soon after unplugging. this is an easy fix - I bought a new battery specifically for this monitor on Amazon for about $12.  The new battery is doing great.3) to switch between cameras you have the option of locking in on one room or scanning between rooms automatically every few seconds.  it doesn't automatically switch to a room if it picks up noise and it doens't stick to the room where noise is coming from.  so, if one kid is crying, and then it's silent and then they're crying again, it's not that they've stopped crying, but that the camera moved to a different room and the kid in the other room isn't crying.  this took my sleep-deprived mommy brain awhile to adjust to since I would think \"silence, ok, I can go back to sleep\".  I have learned to listen to the house sounds in this situation or get up and lock the monitor in on the baby's room if I'm not sure if the baby is just 'fussing' and will settle down or if the baby is really crying.4) I had no problems getting a signal b/w an upstairs room on the opposite side of the house and the master bedroom on the lower level, but tons of trouble getting a signal between the baby's and master bedroom, both on the first level and maybe 30 feet away from each other.  I was infuriated about this when I lost signal in the middle of the night and the horrible lost signal beep woke me up.  The next day I remembered there is an antenna on the back of the parent unit, raised this and once again had full signal for the lower bedroom.  I can take the parent unit anywhere again (as long as this antenna is up).5) I've had the parent unit and one of the cameras for almost 3 years (June 2013 to April 2014 today) and have had no problem with the clarity of picture or function of the features.  As I said, I've only had to replace the battery, but I don't see that as a surprise or a big deal.6) my favorite feature is the temperature.  Not many monitors offer this feature and I find it reassuring.  I think my gauge is a little off, but I don't expect it to be perfect.  It's within an acceptable range.The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish it picked up and switched views based on sound and I wish it allowed for more than one parent unit to see a single camera.", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Monitor but Crappy Cord and No OEM Replacements available for purchase from Motorola", "Author": "Newschues", "ReviewID": "R2DPPX2MN63F2T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This monitor is great, decent audio/visual quality (even at night), temperature gauge, and speaker function so you can talk to your child.

I contacted Motorola, and after several tries (their customer service department seems to be focused on cellular phones and doesn't really care all that much about you if you are just purchasing a baby monitor it seems!) finally got a hold of someone.  I was told that since the warranty period was over they could not replace the cord, and that I should purchase a replacement cord off of amazon, to which I replied that I had already tried that, THREE different cords, none of which worked properly.

It's the video that's the battery sucker.  We did run into an issue with the power cord, right where the jack goes into the parent unit.  But that was because we aren't as careful and our toddler sometimes gets a hold of it and throws it around.  When I saw that the unit was not charging b/c of the damaged jack, I was devastated but it was remedied by taking it to Radio shack and buying a switchable AC adapter there (3-12V, 1000 mA), as well as what looked to be the matching adapter plug (Adaptaplug size A).

I did however research the baby monitors for some time, looking for the one which would meet all my criteria and after almost giving up hope found the Motorola monitors. I was initially planning to get the MBP20, but since it was out of stock for the longest time I decided for the MBP36 and I am not disappointed!- FHSS wireless technology: even though I am a techno junkie and if I can set something up wireless I do, I get no interference from other electronic equipment in the house. Also no problems with getting on channels of my neighbors' baby monitors, which I saw was a huge complaint with other monitors/technologies- Sound quality: Oh I can hear the little bugger complain very well ;). The sound is always on, which means that if your baby is listening to lullabies, so will you. But I can still hear every small cough and whimper, so that's fine with me.- Video: not a feature I was initially looking for, now is my fav part of this monitor. My baby is a cat napper, but when caught early enough I can shhh him back to sleep. However, he will not make a single sound until he is fully awake. With video I am able to see him waking up. The quality of video - both day and night is great. Nice colors during the day and clear, sharp image during the night. It even shows small moon on the screen when in the night vision mode. You can turn off the video and keep only the sound.- Remote Pan/Tilt/Zoom: brilliant! We have the camera mounted where I can pan/tilt both on the swing and the crib. Before it was mounted I would move it to different locations and with ease remotely pan/tilt instead of trying to get the camera positioned exactly right. I believe it will come in ever more handy once LO becomes more mobile. Very useful feature and in my opinion worth the extra money if you cannot decide between this model and the MBP33.  I am not using the zoom much - the picture is good enough I had no reason so far.- Range: per specs it is 650 ft(200 m). I am not sure it is that far really, but it allows me to walk across the street and into my neighbors house. Only inside it cannot find the camera anymore (but I didn't try with the antenna up). Never had a problem with losing a signal inside our 2 story house.- Battery life: the advertised 3.5 hours is pretty accurate. The provided power cords are fairly long (8-9 feet) so I rarely use it unplugged.- Temp: can switch between F or C. The icon and reading turns red if the temp is > 84 F or < 57 F.- Talk mode: one of the few monitor out there with a two-way talk feature.- Sound indicator: again, nice touch and fairly accurate. 4 lights, green, orange, red, red.- Quality/Looks/Ease of use: 5 out of 5 on all 3 counts. Parent unit has built in little swivel leg. No belt clip, but with the screen this size you probably don't want to haul it around too much anyway.This monitor comes to ideal so close, that I don't really have list of cons - more like a wish list/slightly annoying list:- the thermometer sensor is short - less than 1 inch so if the monitor is mounted on the wall it will pick the wall temperature rather then the room temperature. Longer probe would be useful for more accurate temp read.- there is no way to turn the sound completely off. You can reduce it to almost none, but never turn it off. I learned to live with it.- it takes 16 hours to fully charge the battery from empty. 16 hours. Cannot think of a single electronic in my house which takes that long.- the camera turns off when on battery after 2 minutes. I understand that Motorola wants to save battery life so it looks better in the specs - but please give me an option to turn the energy saving option off if my heart desires so. I already have plenty of energy efficient baby toys and swings I have to remember to keep powering on.- no battery for camera. The cord is nice and long, but it would be nice to be able to take the camera outside.- mounting: the base of the camera has a small hole which allows for hanging it on a wall. Wish there was an option of a clip, etc so I don't have to keep stacking books up to get the camera high enough to get a good view when not mounted.- no white noise reduction: LO needs his white noise (i.e. ocean waves). I don't. Enough said.- not able to take pics: even though the Amazon description says you can take pics I am unable to find that feature. Didn't plan to use it, so I don't miss it, but if you are buying for that purpose, be aware.- 2 way talk: you have to speak up to be heard on the camera side and the camera doesn't have volume control. On the bright side it doesn't seem to scare the kid.All in all I would recommend this baby monitor. Nice looks, awesome functionality.

Every time my baby cried I felt torn as I wanted to go check on him, but didn't want to disturb him (he is a very light sleeper).So I started looking for a video camera.I did a lot of research and decided on this camera and I am so glad I did! The picture quality is great day or night, the camera that I mounted above the crib covers the whole nursery, and the two-way talk feature is very nice.My now 9 months old actually naps better with this camera. He used to wake up often and not go back to sleep, but now as soon as I see that he is awake, I'll talk to him and turn on a lullaby and he goes right back to sleep.He is a light sleeper, so his nursery is set up on the opposite side on the house. Because of that I needed a camera with a wide range, and unlike several other models I looked at, this one has it. I get a great signal from anywhere in the house and even the yard.Also unlike some other cameras, this one doesn't have to be plugged in and has a good battery life. I usually plug it in at night, but carry it around with me during the day.Overall I am extremely happy and would recommend this camera to anyone.", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love this baby monitor!", "Author": "Melissa C.

Amazon shipped the units out amazingly quickly from both the warehouse and wherever the new product came from.  The cameras were super easy to install, and they paired beautifully with the parent unit, after that unit charged overnight.  We were thrilled with the mobility of the pan/scan camera feature, the temperature feature, and enjoyed being able to talk through the monitor and camera.  In dealing with one semi-emergency situation, the visual/auditory communication afforded by the unit was incomparable.  The video image was surprisingly good by the LED and the auditory was excellent.  We could hear snoring in the room and dogs outside the monitored room, barking. The control mechanism was pretty easy to figure out.  We were very happy with the purchase.Then the trouble started. Not long after we had the unit, the video screen would start going completely white. No words, no Motorola logo, nothing. We tried turning it on and off, and sometimes the video would pick up again. Sometimes the video would kick in only if we unscrewed the battery case jacket and unplugged and plugged the battery in. In this case, we also had to go back and un-mount the cameras and re-pair them with the parent unit.  When this happened late at night, this required us to disturb those who we were monitoring.  This really wasn't going to do. I called Motorola and talked to their customer service; they were willing to exchange it, but they said that they could not send out a replacement until they received the defective unit.  The gal I talked to understood our predicament - that we bought it BEFORE we had to monitor the upcoming health issues, so that it would be here and set up, for when we knew we'd need to be paying attention. She suggested I return the unit through Amazon, which was an incredibly quick and easy process (Thank you Amazon!).The replacement unit, like the first one, was easy to set up and worked ever-so-well. We were really happy with it, again, and figured we had just gotten a fluke unit, with the first one.  We left it on all the time.  However, due to the unit's being so good about picking up sound, when a houseguest arrived and we had no imminent emergencies on the horizon, we turned the unit off for the night. When we tried to turn it back on... White screen. This second unit absolutely refused to submit to the tricks we'd used on the previous one, to cajole any image out of it at all.  Again, unacceptable.Because we knew we had to be monitoring again, within two weeks, I got right on contacting Motorola again. I wanted to know if they had heard of this problem, if there was anything I could do to fix it, or if I was going to keep getting defective units.  The first gal I talked to said that she had heard of the 'white screen' issue (the second one had not).  She thought maybe I got two out of a 'bad batch', and should probably exchange straight from Motorola.  She reiterated the Motorola policy of not sending out a new unit, until the defective one arrived, so I moved with absolute expediency.  I had all the required information, called that evening and got the claim started, but then I was to follow directions in an email. The email took at least a day, and there was a list of demands that had to be met, the least of which was that I had to send the package via a service that did tracking, pay for the shipping myself, and email them the tracking number.  I did this, and had the package at UPS the afternoon following my receipt of the email (A Tuesday). The lady at UPS said the package would arrive the following Monday, which it did (I checked the tracking number). I figured if there was 5-6 days shipping, I'd then get a return package by the following Monday, or with luck maybe Friday or Saturday. Monday would be a day or two before we had to start monitoring the critical health situation again - cutting it close, but by this time we were pros at setting up the monitor. I figured we'd be safe.Friday came. No package from Motorola.  Saturday...No package.  Monday...No package. I emailed the person who had sent me the how-to-return directions. Monday night I had to get up every few hours to go walk over into the adjacent camper where the cameras were set up, and disturb those whose health we were concerned about... My husband and I were exhausted by morning (they probably were too).  The next day (Tuesday), I got an email stating that my replacement unit would be shipped out as soon as possible.Not acceptable - if their policy is that I have to have a tracking number and get the unit to them within a certain frame of time, and pay shipping, ect, the least that Motorola could do is honor their end of the deal - and ship out a replacement as soon as they received the defective unit.  My email back to Motorola was somewhat cranky and I invited the representative to join me in a few sleepless nights until the unit arrived, having to get up and monitor the critical health situation.  I also requested overnight shipping.The response I got Wednesday (today) was from a different person, to whom the email correspondence had evidently been forwarded.  This person told me that my replacement had already been invoiced to ship, and she could not change the invoice to overnight shipping. She did say that it shipped out and she provided me with a tracking number...The interesting thing was, that the tracking number she provided me was the same that I had provided Motorola - which said that the unit had already been delivered to Motorola, the previous week's Monday...Color me unimpressed. I have received no return email from Motorola's representatives. So far, they have not sent out the replacement when they implied they would, they only noticed there was a problem when I emailed to ask about the location of the replacement, and when they supposedly sent out the replacement, they furnished me with the same tracking number that I had given them.Who knows where the unit is, and I now look forward to a Friday/Saturday/Sunday night of getting up every hour or two to hike over to the adjacent camper for welfare checks on our monitorees.Summary:The unit is super - if you get a good unit. There is evidently a 'white screen' problem.I am very very glad I bought from Amazon...Though I don't know if at this point they will refund my money if the third one that I got from Motorola proves also defective (if Motorola can manage to locate it and send it to me sometime this year).Amazon customer service so far has been amazing.Motorola customer service was great, but their return/claims department is not ... Well.  Yeah.I bought the unit, over the other ones I researched for six weeks, because of my (previous) impression of reliability of the Motorola brand name.  I have since dramatically revised both my opinion of the dependability of the products and any shot at competent returns from that company.

I woke up to a picture of my daughter still and quite when in reality she was awake, screaming, and moving around....and I had NO CLUE!  Obviously I was upset and very disappointed in this monitor.  We'd used it for four months, and had been very gentle with it.  It never fell or was treated roughly.  I contacted Amazon and they replaced the monitor.  (UPDATE:  per the comment from Motorola below I contacted them.  Their \"fix\" for this issue is to have me pay to send in my defective monitor, and then once they received it they will mail me out a new one.  So I'd not only pay to ship it, but I'd also be waiting a few weeks for a replacement.  Really, that's the best you can do?  Not impressed.  Thankfully I bought it from Amazon and they stand behind their products.  More so than Motorola.)UPDATE #2.  The new unit I received from Amazon seemed to work better.  Then about 13 months in one of the child unit cameras stopped working.  I contacted Motorola about this and reached a helpful rep who sent me out a new camera.  Great, we were back in business!

There is no way to mute this device.  This means that if your screaming baby is in the room next to yours (where you can obviously hear him/her), the crying is only amplified, and with an even more annoying delay, so not only is your baby crying, but he/she's crying with FX. The monitor has a great visual sound monitor (5 LED lights that show sound level in the baby room), but who the heck cares if you CAN'T TURN THE SOUND OFF?!  What is this visual sound monitor FOR?! Not only can you not mute the sound, but as other reviewers have mentioned, the volume is buried in a submenu, so you have to navigate through menus to simply turn the sound up and down.  I would definitely prefer a wheel, or at least dedicated volume buttons.2. I can't believe there's no clock on this thing.  Really?  No clock.  What would that cost, like 97 cents?3. The claim of 200 meters is absolutely comical.  This thing barely reaches 250 feet (I know, because it doesn't reach my studio, 250 ft. from the baby room), let alone over 600 ft. [UPDATE: I am ASTOUNDED by the added range of simply putting the antennae up; I always thought cell phone, etc. antennae were a joke, but this one actually works, and I can get MUCH closer to the advertised range.]Other Cons:When will manufacturers of baby equipment/devices stop utilizing ABSOLUTE CRAP music?  Please forgo the \"lullabies\" and include a damn clock.The buttons that control everything (including tilt/pan) are on the front of the monitor.  Thus if you put the monitor in your pocket, the camera will definitely NOT be pointing at your baby any more.The monitor battery is proprietary (no battery for camera, it has to plug into the wall), so once the monitor stops holding a charge, the device will no longer be of any use.  Since Motorola doesn't make it easy to buy replacement batteries, it's not like Motorola is making money on after market/replacement batteries, so why not just use freaking REGULAR batteries that I can replace?!Finally, the mounting hole on the base of the camera is unidirectional (a large hole with the smaller slot in only one direction).  If you are mounting the camera on the wall, your baby will appear upside down unless you put him/her in your crib with his head towards you and his feet away (who in the world sets their kid down feet away?).  By simply creating a mounting hole with four slots radiating out in all four directions (instead of just one), you could mount this camera whichever direction you liked.  A very simple solution to a very frustrating problem.Pros:I like being able to monitor temperature.  We use a small heater to keep the baby's room temperature higher than the rest of the house, and it's great to know exactly what the temp is in the baby's room.I was surprised by the function that allows you to remotely move the camera (tilt/pan).  The servos are virtually silent, and the range of motion is great.  They include \"zoom\" as part of the motion control, but the zoom is simply a digital doubling of the picture, so there's no in between, and the zoom is super pixelated (in other words, the zoom is COMPLETELY useless).The night vision is excellent (at close range).  The camera utilizes IR lights, which are invisible to the human eye, but are picked up by the camera.  Thus, there is a light shining and illuminating your child, but the room stays dark.  The only thing that can \"see\" the light is the camera, thus you can see in the dark.  Other reviewers complained about image quality, but it seems crystal clear to me (and I work professionally with film and video every day [UPDATE: now that we've moved the camera further from the crib, I have moved to the haters camp --visibility is questionable once the camera moves beyond 6 ft.).UPDATE (5/9/12): Now that our little guy is able to stand up and grab things, we had to move the camera from the edge of his crib to the wall.  Thus, my opinion of this camera/monitor has dropped even more.  When the camera was three feet away from the kiddo, the picture was great.  At only six or seven feet away (mounted up on the wall) the picture is grainy, and it's pretty near impossible to tell what's going on (is that lump really our kid?  is he sleeping or just lying still? is that a badger in his crib?!).  It's better than nothing, but that's about it.And the lack of a mute function continues to aggravate us to no end.  His room is only ten feet from ours, so we don't need to hear him twice (and on a delay).  We have to actually turn the monitor off at night (so we aren't listening to his sound machine through the monitor's tinny speaker) and turning the monitor on to check him is always preceded by a BLINDING FLASH of eye gouging light from the ridiculous and completely useless \"Motorola\" splash screen.  Really?!  WHY IN THE H**L is a splash screen necessary, especially when it's on a field of white that seriously jabs your eyes out at 4 o'clock in the morning.If I had it to do all over again, I'd spend $100 on an IP camera with the same functions (pan and tilt, IR night vision, and two way intercom) that ads the capability of using my phone as a monitor so we can keep an eye on him even when we're away from home and he's with a babysitter.  Not to mention at nearly a third of the cost.UPDATE (8-1-13): The power adapter has completely come apart at both the wall and monitor (both ends).  The wires are exposed and short out constantly.  I have tried to make repairs, first simply with electrical tape, then with soldering, but the materials continues to deteriorate.  Whatever they used for the wire sheathing is a sub-par material that will not last. Further disappointment from this overpriced monitor. The ONLY thing that keeps us using it is the temperature readout so we can tell the temperature of our child's room.  I guess I should probably just get get a wireless thermometer for in there and stop using this Motorola cam/monitor altogether since we are also running the Foscam IP Cam which has a MUCH better picture and can be viewed with our computers/smart phones.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT MONITOR....

I originally had 2 cameras, one for each of my babies, and used the monitor EVERY naptime & at night. It let me get more chores done, take showers more often, and even spend more time with my husband.It worked great for 7 months or so, and then the sound started randomly cutting off and the picture quality was deteriorating. Eventually the volume stopped working altogether. I called customer service at Motorola and they were very professional and accommodating, only requiring me to have my original receipt and to send the old monitor/camera set back using a pre-paid shipping label they provided. They sent me a new set of 2 cameras with monitor, and the first thing I noticed immediately after setting it up was that the picture quality was deteriorated on the new monitor, much like my it was on the monitor I had shipped back to them. Otherwise, the camera worked great and the sound quality was back to normal. Then, after only a couple of months, the volume on the 'new' monitor started cutting in and out, so I called them back and was sent a newer model, which is the one I have now. Straight out of the box, this newest monitor had problems with the volume cutting off, and the picture quality is the worst of the 3 I've gone through.

I bought three of them before I found one that worked.  I tried the Samsung SEW-3037W, the Levana Astra, and the Motorola MBP36.First, the Samsung SEW-3037W  failed on the first night, leaving us high and dry.  They also had terrible telephone customer service the night the unit failed, and they continue to pester me because they want me to change my review.Next, the Levana Astra that I got to replace the Samsung stopped working in an even worse way, freezing a peaceful image of our baby sound asleep, without giving us any indication there was a problem.  After a while I decided to check on him because he was a little too still. I found him screaming for us. His image, asleep, was still on the monitor.Finally I bought a Motorola.  It hasn't failed us yet and it's been in use for over a month!  (I have developed lower expectations during this trial) I'll briefly compare them for anyone comparing audio-video baby monitors that have large viewing screens and night vision.Screen Size:All three have similar sized screens around 3.5 inches.Video Quality:All three have comparable video quality. All three have night vision which works well.  All three have a false \"zoom\" feature, which is actually just a magnification of the image, and is not all that helpful.Audio Quality:All three have comparable audio. All three have \"talk to baby\" option, which causes our baby to stare angrily at the camera mounted to his wall.  We tested the roboticness of the sound coming out of the camera to determine whether it would seem scary to baby. It sounds fine on all three.Other bells and whistles such as lullaby:I don't need or want these, so I am not reviewing them, or even noting which products have them.Ease of use:They are all fine, and similar. They all set up the same way.  You put a drywall screw on a wall near the crib (but the cord shouldn't come within 3 feet of baby as it's a strangulation hazard) and mount the camera to it.  The parent unit goes wherever the viewer will be.  In our house none of these devices could stay in contact with the nursery if we took the parent unit to the far end of the house.  Fortunately for us the baby's room is directly next to our room, and if we put our parent unit in the doorway to our living room, we can stay connected.  In my opinion the range is rather lacking on all three.I think the Samsung & Levana use a style of pan/tilt control button that is a little easier to control than the Motorola, which has separate buttons for each direction.  The Motorola uses the direction buttons to control the other features such as brightness and volume.  Not crazy about that but it's alright. The motorola does not have backlit buttons, making it necessary to use a cell phone or something to shine on the controls if you're, say, in the dark, in your bed.  I think the other two had easier to read buttons, or maybe it was just the shape of them that made more sense.  You have to see what you're doing with the Motorola because if you blindly push buttons you might accidentally turn on the lullaby.Reliability and manuals:Samsung: not reliable in my experience because it failed. It did have a warning beep to tell us it wasn't working, fortunately. The instruction manual did not offer a solution to our problem and it had to be sent back.Levana: very not reliable in my experience because it failed and didn't warn me it was failing. Comes with no user manual. Sent back.Motorola: Reliable.  (thank goodness) and has instructions in manual for pairing, should the camera and receiver ever become unpaired.I'm giving the Motorola 4 stars because I like it and it works.

We tried to take it on our front porch once and had to go back inside because it kept cutting out. Our house is pretty sturdy brick, but it's also tiny so it's stupid that we couldn't use it on our porch. Also, the reception is very easily disrupted/glitched by things like using your wireless Internet or running the microwave. It doesn't disrupt the connection permanently, it just kind of causes it to disconnect for a second which is just kind of annoying and a little lame for such an expensive device. Another annoyance is that the stand in the back holds it at a great angle for sitting on the couch, but a horrible angle for putting on a bedside table while you sleep.

The zoom is only digital and it's almost useless as you can't really tell much when using it.My biggest issue though with the system was the monitor battery: it lasts very little by today's standards (internal battery is something like 800mah). So we were using the monitor mostly plugged in which is a major inconvenience. I ended up using one of the 18650 battery cases that has a USB output (any portable USB battery would do) and a usb cable that had the proper barrel adapter at the end to fit this monitor. I got that cable and the adapter with a RAV power portable battery i got here on amazon. With the portable battery runtime is not an issue anymore and mobility is restored.The monitor works fine at 5 volts (usb voltage) and charges. The good thing is that even when the portable battery runs out, you still have a bit to go because the internal battery is being used.With a 10000mah external battery the monitor will last at least 10 times more than just with the internal battery.

But the picture is decent, as good or better as other video monitors.  The range and battery life are good, as is the build quality and durability. After about a year, the monitor charging cord became frayed (probably my fault - I have a tendency to pull it ouf of the socket by the cord instead of the plug) and Motorola replaced it as a courtesy even though it'd been over a year.  I like the visual audio feedback, where it lights up to indicate how loud the sound is.I would absolutely recommend it to others and I would absolutely re-purchase.That said, there are a few minor quibbles and one big one. The songs are kind of weird/annoying and not soothing like you'd think, and after about a year of use the symbols on the buttons have started to wear off. The zoom is digital zoom, so it's pretty worthless, as it just pixelates an already pixelated nightvision image - but it's no worse than any of the other monitors I've seen, so don't discount it for that reason!The *big* quibble - and Motorola, if you see or monitor these, PLEASE take this into consideration - is that you can't turn off the sound.  Our audio monitor had the same visual feedback, where it lit up depending on how loud it was, but it allowed us to turn the sound completely down and just use the lights for information. This being a video monitor, you'd think they'd have the same option, since it has not just lights for feedback but also, you know, pictures of the baby!

She and I have been using this now for about a month and have not experienced any of the problems in the negative reviews.As a preliminary matter, she bought this and her previous monitor at Babies R Us because of their incredible return policy for products that stop working properly regardless of how long ago you bought it from them. While I buy lots of products on Amazon, sometimes it pays to buy somewhere else for the convenience of returning a defective product. I have read lots of reviews complaining about Motorola support, and am glad that my daughter will never have to find out if they are true if any problems develop with this product--Babies R Us will simply replace it.Here is why I like this product:1. This is the easiest monitor to adjust for the proper viewing angle because you can rotate the monitor directly from the handheld unit. With the Summer unit I used to have to play around a little with the monitor when my granddaughter came to visit. No more. It takes seconds to perfectly adjust this. This ease of adjustment is important to consider if, like my daughter, you will regularly bring the monitor with you to locations outside your home.2. The night vision on this is great. I can easily see my granddaughter, not to mention all the toys in her crib. I have read numerous reviews complaining that the night vision does not work properly or has stopped working, but I have not experienced that, and will update this review if I do.3. The volume can be adjusted to various levels, and the temperature indicator is accurate.4. I do agree that the video button could have been made easier to find when you wake up dead tired in the middle of the night, but as a practical matter it has not been an issue for me.5. I like the large screen size, which makes for easy viewing.6. I leave the handheld unit plugged in most of the time, so I always have a fully charged battery.IMPORTANT: The picture on Amazon does not show the AC cord that is attached to the monitor and must be plugged in at all times. Never attach the monitor to the crib or anywhere near it where your child can reach the cord. There have been tragic deaths caused where children strangled themselves with a monitor's AC cord.Bottom line: This is probably the most expensive infant monitor on the market, but it is well worth the money.Update February 17, 2013: The battery life of a fully charged unit is about 6 hours without an AC power source.

We have only had it for 3 days but like it so much compared to the SI monitor (even when it worked) that I thought I would go ahead and post a review and then add to it down the road.Things we really like:- Better picture then SI monitor - significantly clearer- Longer range then SI monitor - much further- Less interference- Lighter parent handset- We like that there is no touch screen as it was difficult at times to get the touch screen to respond on the SI monitor- Has place to hang camera above crib as SI doesThings we don't like or can do without:- Battery life is shorter then SI- The ability to change the volume is not as convenient with the SI monitor- Menu function not as user friendly - but still easy to use- Temperature is off by 3-5 degrees, it reads warmer then what it is, but we have a thermometer already in the nursery so no big deal.- Has some extra stuff we don't need like lullaby's- Cord for camera is not as long as SI and SI sends you clips to keep cord from reach of your little one.Overall where it matters, picture clarity and range and interference, the Motorola significantly outperforms the SI Touch.  Even with the defectiveness of the SI monitor aside, I would still highly encourage you spend the extra money and purchase the Motorola.  I would also encourage you to purchase from Amazon per the outstanding customer service I received as outlined in my SI Touch review.February 28th UPDATE:About 5 months later and this monitor is still working great for us. Still gives a great picture and has good range. We also realized that we really like that it will beep when it is out of range. The SI touch model did not and if we were in the yard the signal would drop without us even moving at times and we wouldn't even know that the SI monitor had dropped signal until we looked at it. The Motorola beeps as soon as the signal drops. We are very happy with it and would encourage someone to purchase this over the SI touch monitor.UPDATE October 2013Over a year out and the monitor is still working great and we love it.

Summer Infant did better than I had expected, so even though I had cord problems in the end, I was happy with the product overall.I was a little afraid of some of the \"cons\" that some reviewers mentioned.  We've had it about a week now, and it's been great!  I have had no problems trying to maneuver my way around the menu/buttons (volume, display on/off, changing cameras) at night.  I think it would be a benefit if Motorola found a way to have these buttons backlit, but so far, I've had no problem.  I was concerned that you can't mute the volume because we have white-noise machines in our kids' rooms, but this monitor only seems to pick up the noise coming from the kids.  I can hear the white noise, but it's dull and in the background.The video during the day is great!  The video at night is similar to my old camera.  It's a video monitor, I'm not looking for HD quality, so it's what I expected it to be.I love that I can tell my son to get back in his bed without having to go into his room.  It also gives my husband and I a giggle watching our son's reaction to us catching him!So glad I decided to go with this monitor.

We had been using a Levana monitor and were pretty pleased with it, but this Motorola monitor blows our old one out of the water.  We wanted to buy a monitor that could add an additional camera so that we could monitor both our toddler and our baby.  Since we knew we were going to move our toddler out of his crib and into a bed, we wanted to make sure that we bought a camera with the ability to pan and tilt around the room.  The 3.5 inch monitor is pretty pricey, but we have found it is well worth the money.  I think that this is the best baby monitor on the market.  If Motorola would just change a few things, it would be perfect.Pros:-Camera-the visual on the camera is great.  You can see very well in both light and dark.-Pan n tilt- the pan n tilt function is wonderful and very quiet, which is important if you are trying to monitor a sleeping child.-Multiple cameras-we love the ability to monitor both cameras.  You can toggle back and forth between the cameras, or you can do a scan.-Temperature reader-I never thought this function would be that important, but we use it a lot to make sure that the kids' rooms aren't too hot or too cold.  We've found that the temperature reader is very accurate.-Ability to listen without the video-This is a nice feature that we did not have in our old monitor.  I like to be able to leave the sound on without having to see the light off of the video.  Also we find that the LCD lights telling you the volume of their noise has been very helpful too.-Great volume sensitivity-even on the lowest setting, you can hear pretty much every noise in the room.-No interference-we have had no problems with interference with our wireless or any other products.  Our old monitor would have interference when we used the microwave.  This one has had no interference issues at all.Cons:-Does not have VOX-this one is I think the biggest con with this monitor.  Our old monitor had VOX, and we used it all the time.  It was great for saving battery life and helping us sleep.  It would be great to only have the monitor turn on when the baby made a loud enough noise.  I have found that even on the lowest volume setting, I can hear almost everything going on in the baby's room, and that can keep me awake at night.-Cannot see picture without volume-I wish there was a way to turn the volume off so that I could just see the picture.

We first tried a sound only monitor which worked very well and we were really happy with it (Philips AVENT DECT Baby Monitor with Temperature Sensor and New Eco Mode), but we decided that a video monitor was a must, especially once he started rolling around. The picture is crystal clear, especially in night vision mode. We've had NO issues with feedback, static, etc (and we have a very extensive wireless network with multiple devices at home). It has a talk back feature which I've found useless so far (but could be handy when he's older - my son is 5 months), can play lullabies remotely (which just aggravates my son, but might work for other babies), and can zoom in and pan and scan, which is awesome!A few of the other reviews complain that the camera view is too close - I have NOT found that to be the case. We have the camera on a shelf maybe one foot past the end of the crib and a few feet above it. Can't see the entire crib, but that's what the pan/scan feature is for! If he moves farther down the crib we just move the camera. To break it down:PROS:-Crystal clear picture, excellent night vision mode. Definitely gives me peace of mind when my son started sleeping face down, and I didn't have to risk waking him up by checking on him. The picture quality is so good that sometimes I can actually SEE him breathing (without zooming in).-Excellent sound quality.-DEFINITELY WORTH IT to spend more and get the pan/scan and zoom in feature.-No static or interference issues.-Can expand to up to 4 cameras! Great for multiple rooms/children.CONS:-No \"mute\" feature. Not cool. The lowest setting is ear splitting at night. Definitely the most ANNOYING thing about this monitor.- THE BIGGEST CON: Battery life. Not very long. Maybe 3-4 hours, with the video off most of the time, 2 or less with video on. You have to move the a/c adapter with you everywhere, and so far I haven't found a way to buy extra a/c adapters. Very BIG CON since we have a two story house and my husband and I take turns getting up with him at night. We have to move the a/c adapter between our upstairs loft tv area, downstairs family room, and my side of the bed and my husband's side of the bed. It is EXTREMELY ANNOYING.-Nothing to clip the parents unit onto your pants or something as you move around the house. I have put the parent unit in my pocket, the buttons get easily pressed, and accidentally moved the camera to face the wall.-Can't adjust the sensitivity of the microphone, as I could with the Philips model.**EDIT 04/18/13**We've been using this monitor for over a year now, and still completely love it! We just had another child, and we got a camera to put in her room as well. The worst thing about this monitor is still the lack of battery life. After almost a year of use, the battery life on the monitor is pretty much nonexistent. Even with the video off, it lasts less than an hour, so it pretty much always has to be plugged in. Motorola doesn't make extra a/c adapters (that I've found), but a friend had two that she wasn't using anymore, so now we have one downstairs, one upstairs, and one in our bedroom. If we didn't have those extra ones, I think we would go insane moving the a/c adapter all over the house all day long.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "A good monitor, but has its flaws", "Author": "Jklondono", "ReviewID": "R212QEB45P4M2Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had one of the Summer video monitors for the past 16 months, and it was a three-year-old model with a small, 1.5 inch screen. So now that we are having our second and decided to get a monitor that is capable of housing two camera feeds, I thought we would upgrade to one of the newer \"fancier\" video monitors. We decided to go with the 2.8 inch screen, which is more than sufficient for us. It definitely has its pros ...Pros:Small, pretty thin, compact. Your not lugging around some big, bulky monitorDoesn't pick up a whole lot of interference. When our old monitor was turned up loudly, we heard a \"buzzing\" of silence. This one doesn't have that, which is niceWhile we haven't used the 2-way or the lullaby features yet, I am sure they will come in handy with the new babyWhen the monitor is plugged into the charger, the screen stays on until you manually turn it off. When it's not plugged in, and you utilize the \"play\" button to turn it on and it stays on for a good bit of time (2minutes, maybe??) Our last one was only 20-30 seconds, which was kind of annoying. So this amount of time is better for me.Cons:This is probably the most bothersome to me, and I didn't see any other review that mentioned it ... You have to look at the screen straight on to get the right visual. So, if it is sitting on the table, and I am sitting on the couch, the screen looks black-ish unless I am at the right angle ... so I have to sit up and grab the monitor and hold it in the right position/angle in front o f my face. I know it isn't a huge deal, but it's a downside that wasn't expecting. It's not that you can't see anything in the crib if you aren't at the right angle, but you can't really make out the baby, etc. The same is true if you are looking to the side or down on the screen.I have no idea when this monitor is fully charged?? Honestly, I haven't pulled the manual back out to see what the deal is, but so far, when we've left the monitor plugged into the charger for 10-12 hours, it still shows (via icons and lights) that it's charging. It doesn't seem to give me a \"fully charged\" message. So, again, this could be something I need to research a bit more ... but I've left it plugged for long amounts of time and am expecting some sort of notification that never comes.Doesn't have a clip ... a lot of monitors have a clip so as you walk around the house while the baby is sleeping, you can just clip this to your pants or whatever. While I didn't use this much with our last one, I do miss it a little bit ...Overall, the screen just isn't as clear or \"clean\" as you would expect it to be. It's a bit foggy, almost like you are zoomed in (it does have a zoom feature, which seems pointless because you can't rotate the screen). It works ... and for us, it's a solid purchase.

One set lasted 2 years which I replaced and I have purchased a new set for my 10 month old when he was born. This Summer Infant Video Monitor was probably the best out there prior to these Motorola Video Monitors but still had lots of issues. They had a lot of statics, get interfered easily even when you put a limb near the video unit, and they have very poor range.  We enjoyed them nonetheless being that there were non better out there.When I got my first set of these Motorola Video Monitors, I was blown away! The previous reviews are all correct.  The range is great, no static, all the feature functions work well, and did I say no static and great range?There could be improvements in the button and menu layout but I'm ecstatic with this product coming from what I have been using.  It's like a big leap in technology advancement going from the Summer Infant to these.  I do agree that the video quality is not as good as other monitors but I'm a true believer in living with the downsides of a product if the key areas of the products work well and done right!The one major major draw back that I have recently found out is when I bought my second set to replace the other summer infant video monitor in my other child's room.  I was planning to have both cameras synched to both video/parent units.  That way, I have two handsets that can be used to view either cameras.  NOPE!  Can't do that! Even though the description says that the parent unit is expandable up to 2.You can only synch one camera to each handset/parent unit.  If you want to synch both cameras to one handset/parent unit, the other handset/parent will be useless. This is really disappointing!  I hope the company can update their firmware to handle this in the future if that is even possible.  Maybe, it's just something they had meant to do but couldn't get the functionality working in time for launch or couldn't get it working at all in that configuration.I still intend to keep both my sets to have each camera synch to their respective handsets/parent units.The other issue is that when you have the 2 handsets/parent units sitting next to each other, I have found that one of the units will lose signal.  It seems that one of units is interfering with the other and causing the other one to lose it's signal stream.  I wonder if anyone else have seen this issue.Overall, it's a no brainer if you only need one of these units.  If you need more than one, it really depends if you are willing to live with the issues I've mentioned in the above.  I am trying to figure out if I want to go back to the summer infant for the closer range room and return this second unit or just keep it and live with the issues.

The clarity during the day is not as grainy as my old monitor, and at night in pitch black darkness holds up pretty good too. You can increase/decrease the brightness.3. There is absolutely NO static! NEVER! I could talk on my cordless phone right next to the camera and nothing gets interrupted (not my phone call or the monitor).4. There's total privacy with this monitor, so your neighbors with the same monitor won't see into your house because it's set to the same frequency or whatever.5. Unplugged from the AC adapter, the monitor's battery could work for about 4-6 hours... if you keep the screen turned off and turn it on only to check on the baby. The sound remains on even if the screen is turned off. And there is a battery indicator, so you know approximately how much time you have left before it shuts down.6. My favorite thing about the monitor is that I can move the camera via monitor controls. When the camera moves, it makes no sound at all. Very quiet! My son rolls around the entire crib in his sleep, so if he moves out of the shot, I can just move the camera to where I can see him. It's super cool and I'm constantly using this feature!!!

My son doesn't care for this feature, but it's still nice.There's only 2 things I don't like about this monitor, but it's not worth deducting 1 point for it! To control the volume, I have to go through the menu options. At night, that can be a problem when you can't see anything. But I've learned to memorize where the buttons are by just feeling my way through. My old monitor had a volume wheel on the side that I just moved up and down. The second thing I don't like is that the monitor can never be MUTED! Seems ridiculous, but sometimes you might want to mute it and just have the screen on... you can't.

Let me explain.When stating whether something is good, you have relative and absolute.RELATIVE to other baby monitors on the market, this one is good.  You can talk to the baby, it supports up to 4 cameras, and the image quality is good (even at night, as long as the camera is close to the baby).Without comparing it to other baby monitors, this one is, by itself, a complete piece of trash.-The battery life is laughable -- if you actually use the video feature, you'll get MAYBE 1 - 1.5 hours of battery life.  If you turn off the LCD screen, it goes up to maybe 2-3 hours tops.-The audio stops working for no reason.  We are on our second one and have the same issue as the first one: no audio.  When the baby cries or makes other noises, the LED's on the unit light up to signify that it's receiving the noise, but there is no audio.  And yes, for all you wannabe technical support experts, the volume is turned up.  The only \"fix\" I've found was to hit it against a table or desk -- then it would kick in, but for how long?-If you have multiple cameras set up and one of them becomes unplugged, you can't use the SCAN option (which switches between all cameras every few seconds).  It just starts to beep and hangs on the missing camera instead of bypassing it.Here's my advice:  buy this monitor from a store that takes easy returns.  Keep the box, receipt, instructions, and everything else in the box.  When it dies, return it or pull a switcheroo.  This product has many manufacturer's defects but Motorola doesn't really care since this product represents very little of their bottom line.The absolute best worst monitor on the market.

I sent them my order off of my Amazon order history, no, they wanted something showing both the date and the price.  Amazon very helpfully faxed me this information, which I sent on to Motorola.  They got back to me today that the adaptor was likely physically damaged and thus they would not cover it.  They did not even offer to sell me a replacement adaptor, they recommended I go to Staples or Radio Shack to get another adaptor.  This monitor has a very small ac adaptor that is non standard, I'm sure it will be a nightmarish search to find one that works with the monitor.  Free time to go jaunting around town shopping for a non standard sized adaptor is what I certainly DON'T have with 15 month old twins in tow.

With a new baby on the way, and a toddler still in a crib, we are really glad we made the switch to the Motorola, and have been really happy with it.The directions were straight forward and after reading through the booklet briefly, it was really clear how to navigate the menu.First of all, the screen is HUGE -much larger than the Summer one- and the quality is clear and sharp even at night. I just looked at the monitor just now (nap time) and can see my son's chest breathing in and out.Unlike my previous monitor, the Motorola monitor does so much more than simply provide video.The speaker enables me to speak to my son without going into his room physically. This is probably more helpful for a toddler vs a newborn, but I think is a neat feature regardless.I have also been pleasantly surprised by the lullaby settings. My son demands music at bedtime. Usually we set up my iPod and he can be picky about song choice, and our speakers mean extra cords in the room and I would rather the room be as cord free as possible for safety! (Toddler has been known to climb out of crib). Also, I always have to go back into his room to shut off the music once he's asleep. I tried remotely turning on the melodies straight from the monitor, which I can then easily shut off remotely via the parent unit once he's asleep. He has gone right to sleep 3 nights straight! I imagine this feature will also be wonderful for a newborn.I also love the remote pan, tilt and zoom features, which enables me to adjust the \"eye\" of the until so that I can better see my child as he moves around in the crib.Volume control is straight forward, and I find that because I can so clearly see all of my toddlers movements on the screen, I keep the volume low.Last but not least, I love that the monitor reads the temperature in the room. We live in an old house where temperature from room to room varies. It definitely takes some guesswork out of dressing the baby properly when you know the temp in the room where the baby is.I would recommend this monitor for parents of both infants and toddlers.

My son had been standing in his crib crying and by the time we woke up and checked on him, he had fallen backwards over his blankets and stuffed animals, and cried himself to sleep...it was heart breaking! Of course, at this point it was too late to ask Babies R Us (where we purchased) for a replacement, so we contacted Motorola (NOT easy by the way, they don't make it easy to get a hold of anyone!). When I finally was able to talk to someone, I was happy to hear she would be sending me a replacement. But that happiness sure ended quickly.The new monitor arrived and we began using it and it worked just fine...for about a month. 1 MONTH!! And then the sound kept going out, it would go out for maybe 5 seconds, or even for a few minutes, and then come back on.

We loved this Motorola product too! Until about a month after baby first started sleeping in her nursery all through the night.First, the audio completely blew out on the parent unit. We could see the lights indicating sound was being detected by the baby unit, but no sound came out of the parent unit at all. We tried all the troubleshooting from Motorola and could only conclude that the speaker had blown. So we bought a separate audio baby monitor (Summer Infant), but kept using the camera baby unit and parent video monitor unit.Then about a month after that, the up/down panning on the baby unit stopped working. We could hear the gears moving, but it seemed as if something had stripped or gotten off track and it wasn't catching to actually make the movement.While we're still able to limp this system through to safely monitor baby (with the continued combination of the Summer Infant audio monitor), we're definitely not replacing it with another Motorola unit.

I loved it at first. The picture is great, the infrared function works beautifully, the screen is nice and big, and the panning function is wonderful. I would still love it if it just worked properly and continued working properly for any length of time! I am so frustrated by this monitor that I am compelled to write a review to warn others, and I NEVER do things like this. This monitor worked beautifully for us for about 6 months. I would have given it five stars and recommended it to everybody at that point. The first time it broke was our fault - someone helping to clean our house knocked it off a table, and the LCD screen broke instantly. I was surprised at how easily it broke, but I just figured this type of screen is fragile and we need to be more careful. So we bought the same monitor again, but upgraded to this model from the slightly cheaper one because it had a larger screen. We have had problems almost since the beginning with this model. First, the cord to the unit literally fell apart. My husband had to rig it so that the internal wires were twisted together so it would work at all. Again, I figured we just pulled a bit too hard on the cord and this was probably our fault. But then the cord stopped fitting tightly into the unit where it plugs in. Nothing had happened to the monitor or the cord at where it plugs in...It just somehow loosened up and wouldn't hold the charging connection anymore unless the cord was positioned in a certain way (which was nearly impossible to achieve). We called Motorola and received a replacement cord. This cord fit perfectly (tighter than the first one ever did), so we figured we were home free. Within weeks of receiving the replacement cord that actually worked, the monitor stopped working. We had video, but suddenly there was absolutely no audio. We called Motorola again. I could tell by the fact they asked me no questions and said \"there was no fix for this problem\" that they had received this complaint before. It took nearly a week to get our new monitor from Motorola, so I lost a lot of sleep wondering if I would be able to hear my son crying from his room all the way across the house. We have now had the new monitor they sent us for a matter of perhaps two months at the most. This one suddenly has a new problem: We always have audio, but the screen is completely white with no video about half the time when we turn it on. We are able (most of the time) to fix the problem, but only by opening the back of the monitor with a screwdriver and moving the battery and battery attachment around until the video magically appears again. Obviously, it is not acceptable to have to repair your monitor about 50% of the time when you want to use it. My warranty for this piece of crap will be up in June, so I have no doubt we are going to run into problems with getting it replaced when it keeps breaking (and at this point, I do believe it is \"when\" and not \"if\"). I have even hesitated to call Motorola because the best they will offer is to replace it with another one of these monitors, and I have zero faith in the quality of these things at this point. My son is not even 20-months old, and we have now spent about $400 on Motorola monitors that won't even get us to his second birthday. This thing is not cheap, and I am really disappointed and, frankly, pretty annoyed at this point. I have a lot better things to do with what precious moments of free time I can get than calling Motorola, waiting for replacements, and driving to the post office to send back the broken monitors.

I loved being able to see him, hear him, talk to him, the screen had a great resolution even at night.  Shortly before the one year warranty was up, the screen started going black and wouldn't turn on and off. After removing and replacing the battery it seemed fine, so I didn't bother reporting it to customer service. That was obviously a mistake, because now, 4 months after replacing the battery and the warranty running out, the screen is completely black. It charges with the power cord, but will not turn on. I am disappointed in a company as big as Motorola, that there appears to be a large batch of monitors that break shortly after the one year warranty, which forces parents to have to buy a new one (because what parent wants to be without it when you have a baby/toddler, you need to keep an eye on?) so what, now I am supposed to shell out another few hundred dollars? (that I really don't have because as we all know, babies are expensive!) I expected a baby monitor, for this price and from a supposedly reputable company such as motorola, to last years, not months. It is also disappointing to see that many others seem to have suffered the same fate, yet the warranty remains at one year, because they know it will just about last that before they can take more money.

I didn't contact them because I thought as I was out of warranty they wouldn't be any help, but I was incredibly grateful and appreciative that they reached out to me following my dismay with their product and provided me with a new unit and asked me to return the broken one so they could look at what went wrong.

The price tick up to go with the bigger screen seemed like a no-brainer once we had our daughter, because we could actually see her breathing. The temperature monitor is a great feature, because I can prove to my husband that it is indeed too cold in her room so we have to turn on the heat.However three weeks after the product was bought for us on the day of our baby shower (meaning two weeks before our little one's birthday), the power button stopped working entirely. First it wouldn't turn off (not ideal, but at least still usable). But then we got it to turn off and now it's jammed in there and there is nothing we can do. My understanding from google-searching is that the \"jammed power button\" is a common problem.And after the one-year from purchase Motorola (and their incredibly long-wait for unhelpful customer service people) will not do a thing. Despite this being an obvious manufacturing flaw.We had bought the two camera version, planning ahead for our likely second child, thinking that something this expensive would obviously be built to last through multiple children. Little did we know, it's only really built to last past its warranty date. And Motorola does not seem to have any sympathy for the point.Motorola won't even sell us just the monitor itself at a lower cost. So we have to buy the whole thing (and a third camera) all over again.The hunt for baby monitors is difficult - they all have flaws.  My biggest suggestion to moms and dads out there is to go with a company that has a history of excellent customer service so at least when you fall in love with the monitor you selected, you aren't heartbroken by a company that doesn't seem to care that you expect their products to work longer than a one-year warranty.Pros:The bigger screen lets you see baby breathing if you look closeTemp reading is neat (and helpful if you have a spouse who likes things colder)Sound is very clear and the levels are goodWorks perfectly in our one-story house and can reach the backyard with no issueCons:The power button gets stuck (according to web searches this is a common problem) - and after a year you are out of luckUnhelpful customer serviceVideo does not come back on if your baby starts crying (though sound continues to work)In summary:Yes video is worth it.

It was so quiet that we had to turn it up to the max setting and even then we mostly got white noise.  But, strangely, after a short time this issue resolved itself.  Perhaps there's a loose soldering job somewhere in there.More troubling though is that now that it's gone through almost 2.5yrs in our home the power plug won't stay in firmly enough to charge without some fiddling around.  If I push hard or up or lay the cord on my night table \"just so\" there's no problem.  But if the monitor is accidentally moved by an inch, the blue light goes off and it runs off battery.

We've been using ours for about 16 months.  It has decent range so there are no dead spots anywhere in our house.  Picture quality is 'ok', nothing spectacular but sharp enough to see what your baby is doing.  The audio does work well...it will pick up even faintest sounds.  We have our camera mounted on the wall about 3 feet above the crib (just be careful routing the cord so it's out of reach of the child) and seems to be the best mounting location to be able to see all areas of the crib.Build quality....that's where this thing is lacking.  They really need to reinforce the power connector on the monitor.  You'll see quite a few reviews here where people complain that it simply stopped charging or they need to jiggle the adapter plug to get it to charge.  When my wife first informed me that ours was exhibiting this issue, I assumed it was the actual power cord that was the problem and it was just a loose connection some how.  After more investigating I discovered that the issue is within the monitor itself.  I ended up taking the monitor apart and saw that the solder holding the power connector to the circuit board had broken, which explains why jiggling the plug gets it to work occasionally.  I ended up resoldering the power connector to the circuit board and it permanently fixed the issue.  So Motorola should really beef up how that power connector is supported so that it doesn't rely so much on the soldered joint.EDIT 01/17/14: We just had the sound go out on the parent unit.  This is also a fairly common complaint.  If anyone has basic soldering skills, it's easy to fix.  Take the battery cover and battery out.  There is one tiny screw inside the battery compartment that needs to be removed.  Carefully pry the case apart...work slowly around the case and it will eventually come apart.  You'll then see the two small red & black wires for the speaker.  One of them probably came loose from the main circuit board.

The camera I've had to replace didn't even get used till August 2013 because that's when we started putting the baby in her crib. Right out of the box the night vision didn't work, so I called and they sent a new one. THEN after not even a month, the sound from the baby's camera stopped working. The lights on the parent unit still lit up but no sound, so we got it replaced AGAIN. Well now, twice I've woken up and my baby's monitor is not emitting sound again. If I go in her room and detach and reattach the cord to the camera, it comes back on, but who knows when it's going to cut out again! My 2 yr old's camera hasn't been replaced at all, but the night vision is now fuzzy and I just realized the other day that when I try to talk to her through it that it sounds like some alien radio frequency sound...completely inaudible and therefore useless. It used to sound crystal clear. Who knows when that stopped working. The first time I sent the parent unit back was before the baby was even born.

It's been dropped from second story staircase to hardwood floors below, it's been to the beach, in airplane luggage, pulled off the wall by children, etc. (Has NOT been dropped in water but water has been spilled on it).Overall I feel this monitor has been one of the best investments we've made so far. Not to say it is perfect, I'm still looking for my magical unicorn monitor. However, customers shopping for a video/audio monitor that has range, room temp, night vision and two-way microphone, you will not find one better than this, seriously, I've been looking. Since no one has yet to marry the wifi/network baby monitor with a remote wireless monitor that allows you to use both internet connection or actual monitor device to view your child, I am still left wanting, but I digress.PROS:-900Ft range is farther than any other remote wireless monitor that includes room temp, night vision and two-way microphone (Samsung is 974ft but it's a wifi/network monitor so, that's almost apples and oranges). We have tested these limits in very creative and numerous ways and it's awesome. Need a little bit more boost? A wire coat hanger does the trick. I am very impressed with the range-Room temp monitor: very few monitors have this feature and it's a HUGE selling point for me. Especially for those cold winter and hot summer nights, I like to know so I can adjust temps if needed.-Two-way microphone: you may not think you have much use for this but wait until your little one is or has transitioned to \"the big-kid bed\". You can command them back into bed from thin air. It works every time. But it's not a high-powered mic so it does sound a little metallic/robot-y.-Ability to hook up numerous additional cameras and easily scan back and forth between cameras.-Night vision... The only thing good I can say about the night vision is its name.CONS:-Night vision: I'm sure Motorola has listed the distance for the night vision feature but it makes no difference, it's terrible. Our camera is hanging about 6ft above the crib/bed and it's bearable but you either compromise quality to fit the whole crib in view or have to pan up and down because the camera is so close to see what's what.-Plug: Ugh, the plug is not good. I know a couple of families who have this monitor and everyone ends up either replacing one of the plugs (usually the monitor plug to power source) or MacGyvering the plug to make it work. In our experience, the power source plug connections easily loosen and we end up opening up the wires and fixing it (which I don't recommend).-No silence mode: Unfortunately you can only turn the sound down, not off. We have a sleep-sound machine in our LO's room so I get to listen to soft static coming through the monitor at night.-No option to view camera over the internet.

It worked great... at first.Issues:1) About 3 or four months after purchasing the unit we started noticing more and more issues with signal interruption.  At first it was just once in a while where we would hear the loss of signal tone for a moment then it would come back. This was weird as we were using the camera in the same locations as we always have, and pretty much directly overhead of the baby's room.  We figured it was normal, as interference patterns fluctuate depending on other appliances and such in the environment.  But this has SLOWLY gotten worse over time.  It still works, but there are more moments of signal loss.2) This is the bigger issue for us, the night vision has also SLOWLY died over the life of the product. At first, it was amazing the detail you could see in a pitch black room. We could clearly see our baby at night with the cam placed across the room, and we could zoom (digital zoom) in if needed.  But after about 9 months I noticed a dramatic reduction in night mode visibility range. I mean DRAMATIC.  With the camera 5 feet away you could just make out a form, and we ended up using it for the Audio, and sort of a visual aid during the night.But with the birth of our next child coming at 15 months after having this cam (yes, close... Good bye sleep) I needed a solution I could rely on, and that affordably allowed me to expand.So I'll mention the what I moved to and why, because I wish I knew about this solution before my first child.I bought a Foscam FI8910W IP Camera\u200e.  The cost per camera is about $89.This is a WiFi IP cam that allows you to connect the camera to your local wifi network.  It has full pan and tilt control.  It has night vision.Here is a list of reasons why this worked better for us:1) The Night Vision is OUTSTANDING! Literally clear as day, in pitch black.2) FosCam had a free app for our phones allowing us to view the camera from as many monitors as needed.3) There is a paid app ($4) from a third party developer out there that give you all kinds of functionality not available in the free app that we purchased.4) We have the viewing app on Multiple Devices, allowing me, the wife, and the nanny to view the cam at the same time from different locales in the house. Have it on a tablet too, and can view from the computer.5) The app supports MANY cams so you can purchase as many as you need and view them all at the same time. We have two to monitor the play area and the sleep area.6) If you have a little networking know-how you can set up the cam to be viewable (safely and securely) from outside the home. Both me and the wife check in on our tots while we are at work.7) The paid app has a background monitoring feature so that you can continue to monitor the baby with Audio as you do other things on your phone, or just sleep with the phone near the bed and the screen off.8) The app alerts you with a sound of your choosing when your little one starts moving around, giving you a little advance notice of the pending AWAKENING!9) Two way audio.And most all of these features are also available via a web browser if needed.Setting the camera up on the local network is a breeze.  Setting it up for safe secure viewing outside of the home takes a little bit more know-how, but is obviously very doable.  And there are directions, and good support. You can also assign different passwords for different people so that you can always revoke access at anytime, for any specific viewer (such as if you need to fire a nanny).The BIGGEST advantage is that you can use any smartphone, tablet, or computer as your viewing device and they can ALL be used at the same time.So obviously you can see I am very happy with this alternative solution.One more comment about our Motorola MBP36.  We currently sometimes still use it for keeping an eye on our newborn in our bedroom if we have to run upstairs for a minute to get a drink or the like.  But it literally can't be more than 3 feet away from the baby at night for us to still be able to see him.Go with an IP Camera, you'll be happy you did.

Amazon was of course great the first time sending a replacement same day but now that this happened again I requested a refund and ordered the Samsung SEW3037 instead.

Garrelts", "ReviewID": "R2JP5019Y1WXV1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My wife and I received the Motorola MBP36 Baby Monitor as a shower gift before our son was born and have been using it for almost four months. In that time this baby monitor has become an indispensable part of our lives and daily routine. By and large this is an excellent baby monitor though there are some shortcomings and curious design choices that hamper the device.--------------------LCD & Camera:The baby monitor consists of two major components, the LCD screen and the camera. In our nursery I wall mounted the camera using an appropriately sized screw directly into a wall stud above our child's crib and within easy access to a power outlet. The AC power cord is long, approximately 3m, and is needed to power the camera. Unlike the LCD screen the camera contains no internal battery and thus cannot be used without the AC power adapter. The camera features a built-in wall mount bracket for just such applications.The LCD screen is the other primary component and features a fantastic 3.5\" color LCD screen. To the left of the LCD are the four directional buttons that control the camera's movements. To the right of the screen are four more buttons that control (top-down) menu access; \"OK\" aka \"enter\"; display on/off toggle; and microphone. The menu access button brings up the on-screen menu and the directional buttons provide navigation with the \"OK\" button serving as the 'enter' key. On-screen commands control everything from volume adjustment to lullaby's that you can choose to play via the camera's on-board speaker. The power button is located along the top-left of the base unit.--------------------Installation:Thanks to the base unit and camera communicating via 2.4GHz wireless setup is extremely easy. The most difficult portion of our installation was finding suitable placement for the camera. Because of our nursery design we didn't have a shelf that afforded a good enough vantage of our crib and ultimately decided that wall mounting was the best option. In this configuration the AC power adapter and cord are hidden behind our child's crib so that is a bonus as well. The initial pairing of the camera and base unit is guided and extremely easy and very quick.--------------------Use:Powering on the base unit also turns the camera on and is impressively fast. I'd estimate that from a powered-off state to a completely operational state takes less than two seconds. After that you're set and ready to adjust the camera, volume, etc. as needed. Range is as impressive as Motorola claims. I was dubious about the range before using this baby monitor but I can attest that it lives up to and surpasses my expectations. In my home (single-story + basement) my entire home is completely covered. Video and audio is high quality and without any distortion. I've even used this unit on our patio, in our yard and immediate surrounding area of our home with the baby monitor in my pocket and the video feed is great. The unit does alert you when you're taking it too far out of range.The camera video feed quality is very good as well. Being first time parents we were initially very nervous about every little noise and movement from our baby and constantly monitoring him for any potential problems. That said, the quality of the video feed is enough that you can see a baby's chest rise and fall with their breathing. Audio is equally impressive and picks up on very minute noises. Funny as it might be but we can hear our little boy's burps and flatulence through the monitor. I suspect that this is in part to the proximity of the camera unit to our son and crib. I'm not sure if this unit would pick up those noises if the camera was mounted further away.--------------------What I like about this baby monitor:(+) Very easy setup and operation.(+) Unit powers on and is usable almost instantaneously.(+) Great quality video and audio to include the night vision mode.(+) Construction quality seems adequate given the price point.(+) Expandable with more cameras for folks with more than one baby. Scanning mode to automatically switch between cameras.(+) Attractive design.--------------------What I don't like about this baby monitor:(-) The power button is tiny and sits flush with the top of the unit. This may be a conscious design decision to make the unit harder to accidentally turn off for tired parents.(-) The volume controls require entering the menu to adjust. It is the very first option on the on-screen menu but it's still a paint to adjust in a dark room.(-) The microphone button (allows you to talk through the cameras speaker) is located directly below the video on/off toggle and is in a horrible place! It's very easy to inadvertently hit the microphone button in a dark room or when sleepy instead of the video button if you're just trying to check on your baby.(-) If I had been paying the bill I probably would go with a cheaper baby monitor. This is a very nice monitor but expensive.(-) The zoom function is very limited and only goes to 2x. Again not a huge issue for our application but worth noting.--------------------Technical issues:Only once, but the base unit after being on all day failed to power on (was connected to the charger). Letting the base unit sit unplugged for an hour and then trying to power on again solved the issue. Seemed like it was an overheating issue. Again only happened once but something worth mentioning.--------------------Closing:If you can stomach the price and some odd button placement then this is a very nice baby monitor. Some of the features seem like add-on gimmicks (playing lullaby's for instance) rather than practical options for a baby monitor.

Overall, I'm very satisfied! It does its job, has some very helpful features (one or two that I'll never use) and has given me enough piece of mind to sleep better myself!I had been interested in it with my first son but he's almost 4 and never had one. My younger son turned 2 last month and is an extremely active child who loves to find new ways to get in trouble/terrify me for his safety. He'll be switching to a toddler bed soon and proved he's going to be a handful to keep up with. For me finally, there was a means to justify the cost. It's provided such a sound piece of mind for me.Features I love:- pan/tilt/zoom from parent unit. To me it was worth the extra cost from the model right below this one because my sons room isn't big enough to be seen at all angles. Granted, he's usually in his crib but in case he ever decided to climb out I can pan around. This also eliminates the need to install the camera up in the corner which means its easier to move and take with you anywhere you might need it (we travel a bit). Again, worth the extra money if those are issues like they are with our family.-night vision works quite well. I can see him breathing if I zoom in (he has breathing issues so when he's sick that's very important to me). He's currently riddled with allergies and last night I could even see the soft water vapor clouds created by our humidifier, floating by. So it picks up a lot - you can discern everything in the room without extra effort or strain on your eyes.-attach up to four cameras at once: this is nice because my other son's room is further away and while he's very well behaved (don't feel the need to keep an eye on him as closely, if he's sick I can hear him. I couldn't find an audio monitor that supported to rooms on one parent unit. Plus we want to have a third child soon. The ability to switch over to different rooms is easy or you an set it to scan.-talk back feature: okay, I'm a mean mommy but the first few times I used this it was priceless. The looks on their faces were almost worth the cost of the system. It will come on handy for lots of different scenarios, so far my biggest use is playing a lullaby from my phone.-I appreciate the light up audio sensor on my parent unit. It starts off with blues and greens then leads I to orange and red, which inform you of the audio \"severity\". If you need the volume down you can still see if there's a baby emergency with the lights.-kick stand is sturdy and helpful. Use it a lot.The power button is not located on the interface but up on top and is harder to push in than the front buttons - meaning you can't accident turn it off with out really trying.-adapter cord is pretty long-menu is easy to navigate-temperature in room on display.-gives a good, fair warning beep for a while before the battery dies.-NO static!! Zilch, zip, nada!Stuff I'm not crazy about:- buttons on front are a little too easy to push and change settings. One morning I awoke to the volume turned all the way down because my old, chubby cocker spaniel decided to sleep on top of it. I normally try to not fall asleep with it in my bed. Thankfully she didn't turn on the talk back feature (but the button has to be pushed down continuously, which is good) or one of the lullabies.-the polyphonic lullabies sound like ring tones from my giant brick Nokia cell circa 2000. They aren't soothing in the slightest and the one time my husband played with that feature I had a hard time getting it to turn off. Could certainly live with out it.-kinda wish it told you the time next to the temperature but oh we'll, I'll live.- wish the battery stayed charged a bit longer but fortunately it hasn't interfered too much in my life so far.But overall, I love it.

The power port for the monitor/screen has a ridiculously small (diameter) plug/receptacle that has quit working after 8 months of use. For the past month we had to position the power cord a specific way so the unit would take a charge. Tried a new power adapter and it did not work, so it is definitely a problem with the monitor and not just a bad cord. We contacted Motorola customer support and they told us there was only a 90 day warranty on the product so we are basically out of luck. This unit is way too expensive for a life span of only 6-8 months.This is a very significant issue to consider when potentially buying this item. The power cord will be plugged in and unplugged MANY times during the life of this product as part of normal use. Motorola really should have taken more care to provide a better power solution that could withstand everyday use for years, not just months.UPDATE: After a second round with customer service, letting them know that a new adapter did not fix the issue, they sent us a BRAND NEW unit! We provided proof of purchase and they sent out the new unit first so that we would not have any time without a monitor. Put the old unit in the box and sent it back, they even included the return shipping.

The video was grainy and got worse if you tried to zoom in and the sound cut out constantly so it was not continuous. Another negative was that you could only operate the lullaby feature from the Baby Unit which meant you had to go into the baby's room and turn it on if you wanted to use it. Also, the display brightness was pretty bright, especially for nighttime viewing when your eyes need to adjust. It often hurt my eyes to look at the screen in the middle of the night.Positives for VTech: it has an great feature that allows you to turn off the screen and sound, but when it detects sound from the baby unit, it will turn on automatically (Sound Activation). The negative for that feature was that it wasn't always consistent. Sometimes it would turn on and no sound was coming through the monitor, but this was not a frequent occurance. Another positive is that the lullaby feature has an auto shut off, I believe it was 20 minutes. AND, you could operate the lullaby along with the Sound Activation feature meaning you didn't have to listen to the lullaby yourself through the parent unit because the sound would automatically shut off. This was great for middle of the night lullaby playing, especially because I'm a light sleeper.Also, the lights on the baby unit are pretty dim so it doesn't keep my baby awake and I can see with the night vision pretty well, although grainy because of the picture quality.We ended up returning the VTech because the video was not as great as I thought it should be and the sound quality was starting to bother me when it would just cut out for no reason. Also, when you add a 2nd camera (which we are about to do in a few months) it only views one camera at a time rendering one camera practically useless unless you manually check it throughout the night yourself. This might not be a bad thing for parents of older toddlers, but mine is only 2 and our new baby is coming in July so I'd like to be able to listen up for both of them.For the Motorola monitor, we went with the MBP36 because of the bigger screen and I have to say that the picture quality is far superior to the VTech, however the zoom feature is useless because it zooms in 2x which is too close up. You'd have to place the baby unit far enough away that the zoom would be worth it. So, for us, that feature is a waste.Other Negatives for Motorola: the lullaby feature is annoying. While I love that you can turn it on from the parent unit, it does not have an auto shut off AND you can hear it from the parent unit pretty loudly unless you turn the sound completely off (which means you would not hear your baby crying). Like I said, I'm a light sleeper so the lullaby keeps me awake unless I turn the sound off. So, I end up having to wake up some time later and turning the lullaby off myself and turning the sound back on. It really interrupts sleep having to do all of this at night.Positives for Motorola: the picture quality is much better. I can see more detail and I don't even have to turn the brightness all the way up. the brightness level is much better, even on the lowest setting I can still see at night so it doesn't hurt my eyes to look at it at 3am. I like that you can turn the lullaby feature on yourself without having to get out of bed, but I do wish they would have added an auto shut off to that because having to remember to turn it off is a hassle. The baby unit camera pans further so you can look around the room if you need to and you can pan from the parent unit. The VTech only shifts in one direction and you have to move it directly on the baby unit if you want to change it. It does pan slightly but nothing like the Motorola.The sound quality is much better. It is continuous, though it doesn't have that awesome Sound Activation feature like VTech, I don't hear any feedback/white noise over the monitor. Even on the lowest volume, I can hear my son.Finally, the reason we are keeping the Motorola...when you add another camera it will automatically scan all cameras for 12 seconds each, meaning I don't have to select one camera as the main one. It checks them all throughout the night. This makes me feel more secure knowing that if one baby is crying, i will be alerted no matter what.Honestly, they all have their pros and cons. You have to find what works for you.

This means that I can change what the camera is looking at from wherever I am in my home. I can zoom in and out while sitting on my sofa. I do not have to be standing in the nursery playing with the camera trying to get the perfect angle... and if the kids touch the camera {which they did}, I can easily change it back to the position I want it without physically touching the camera. And it makes no noise when in motion.It comes with a rechargeable battery for the parent unit. You plug it in, charge it up, unplug it and go! It comes with a NiMH rechargeable battery pack, so there is no constant need to replace the batteries and when it is charged you can use the parent handheld unit wirelessly. When used wirelessly the wireless transmissions are digitally secure and safe from unauthorized access.It is really easy to use. There is a menu button that displays the volume control, the camera brightness, the five lullaby options that can be played, the zoom capabilities, the alarm options, the camera display, and the temperature display. There are five LED lights located at the top of the monitor so that displays the noise level. Displayed on the screen is the range {this camera goes up to 590 ft}, the camera being viewed, the temperature, if night vision mode is being used, and the battery charge. There is a little kickstand located on the back and as well as an antenna {although we never needed to use the antenna}.Did I mention that this monitor can work as a two way communicator- meaning that with the touch of a button I can speak to my toddler who is holding the camera and tell him to put it down. This was a big hit in my household. My kids think it is pretty cool that mom can see what is going on and talk to them even when not in the room.The parent unit has a 3.5\" diagonal LCD screen display {roughly the same size as my iPhone4 screen} and it provides a clear color picture. I can easily see my children with this monitor; there is no squinting at the monitor to see and no second guessing what is being displayed. It is also a very light unit to carry around.When in night vision mode, the light displayed on the camera unit is not incredibly bright. This means that the light is not keeping my children awake at night and I am still able to get a clear picture of my child sleeping.I have heard others complain that there is no belt clip, but I never used one on any of my other baby monitors and don't believe I would use one now.

It's easy to adjust the volume and the screen is quite large compared to my last video monitor.  The buttons are simple and I got the hang of it right out of the box.

Were able to fix it but decided to try this one out.  Got it last week.Pros:- Image quality is better than my Summer Infant monitor.  It is signicantly better than the 2010 model I have, though not massively better in my opinion.- two-way communication is nice to \"shhh\" the baby or even if I need to say something to my husband as he's putting baby to sleep (can't do this on my Summer Infant).  i loved the idea of this, but for our son it doesn't seem to help much.  also, the button to do this is easily pressed, say if the parent unit is shoved in the corner of the couch, so i'm always carefull... don't want to wake the baby to the sound of the movie we're watching, etc.- can play lullabies, though we haven't used this feature.  can't be done on Summer Infant.- can add a camera and just use one parent/handheld unit. Summer Infant discontinued the model i bought right after i bought it and doesn't sell a camera that works with it.  They confirmed this to me via email and also confirmed that they don't even sell replacement parts for it!  so beware this if you are buying one now... if a couple of years down the road have another child and want to buy another camera, who knows if the version available at that time will be compatible.  they do offer loyalty pricing, so i could get a complete replacement for $120.- bigger screen is nice.  But at 3AM you don't necessarily want a big bright screen to look at... the smaller screen I had with the Summer Infant was fine.- camera easily attaches to wall.  this is a feature of both units and a major plus for us.  they both just have a little hole at the back, so you can just hang it on a nail.  Very convenient when travelling around and bringing your monitor.  we'd just take down a painting and hang it on the wall wherever we go.  I'd never buy a monitor that didn't have this feature.- tells you the temperature.  this is a major plus for us b/c it can get cold in the baby's room in the winter and hot in the Summer.  They say the temp shouldn't get too hot when they're born to prevent SIDDs, so this is a major plus.  our Summer Infant does tell the temp.Cons:-  No clip to clip it to your clothes.. this can be quite a pain if you're going up and down stairs and need your hands to carry other stuff or if you're moving around the house cleaning stuff, etc.  The Summer Infant clip is very convenient.-  Too many buttons to navigate, especially a pain at night.  one button to pan to the left, another to pan to the right, another to pan up, another to pan down.  you have to press another button to select volume and then yet another two to increase or decrease.  zooming in is enough of a pain that we don't even bother to zoom in much.  and the buttons don't light up so at night, you can't see what you're pressing... bit of a pain to get used to.  Bestview was super simple... a little nob that you push whichever way you want to camera to pan and you push it in to zoom in... very simple and easy to use at night..- sound comes from the back of the parent unit, so if you have the unit on the bed (or any soft surface) next to you, a lot of the sound is muffled out).  not an issue with the Summer Infant Bestview.Overall, if the Summer Infant Bestview told the temperature, had better image quality (which the newer units might) and if they didn't discontinue their old versions and leave you somewhat stranded if you need a replacement or another camera that is compatible, then I'd prefer the Summer Infant Bestview.

I ended up buying this Motorola after my Samsung starting malfunctioning. In summary, this is the best monitor out there overall.Privacy - For starters, if you are security conscious like me - this is the only monitor that encrypts the audio connection to ensure no one can listen in on you. (A baby monitor is essentially a bug you put in your own house - and intercepting these transmissions are not very difficult with equipment anyone can pick up) No other baby monitor uses encryption - even the ones that say \"private\" on the box. (Those simply hop frequencies often - which makes it more difficult, but not impossible, to intercept) So right off the bat, if you care about your privacy, this is your only choice. (Though I wish they encrypted the video too - I'm assuming the hardware to do that was too expensive)Range - This has by far the best range of any video monitor I've tried. I have a larger house, and I have yet to lose the signal anywhere (even in my yard) without even putting the antenna up. I have multiple WiFi access points that also use the 2.4 GHz range, and I still have no signal problems anywhere. Amazing. (My Samsung would simply display a \"no signal\" message in certain areas of the house, much less outside)Features - This has all the most important features (At least for me) - two way communication, remote camera control, night vision, and audio encryption. The leds that show noise level is a nice touch also. The screen is large, and the buttons are well laid out. Also, a quick note - my model has a mute feature. I noticed some reviews here saying you could not turn the volume all the way down. I guess Motorola improved this model in the meantime, as my monitor's volume does go down to 0.Negatives - Only small drawbacks, but still room for this to be even better. The picture quality is good, but for the price it should be better. The bigger screen of the MBP36 makes obvious the low resolution. My old Samsung was just slightly better in this dept. Also, you should not have to go into a menu to control the volume - there should be dedicated volume buttons. Why is there no clock? It's nice to display the time if your baby wakes you. A belt clip would be helpful as well. Finally, I would like some more customization options. For example, why can't I set the video to stay on permanently when on battery? (The monitor will keep the video on when plugged in, and turns off after a minute on battery. Usually this is fine, but I'd like the option)Overall, the best video baby monitor out there. Perhaps not a large compliment, considering the lackluster options from the competition, but true nevertheless.

There are so many other features on this model (which are well explained by some of the other customers), and the resolution is so clear I can actually see the rise and fall of my infant's chest as he breaths (in both regular and night vision).  We were lucky to get a grainy outline of our toddler in the night vision mode of the other brand.  Lastly, a word about some of the negative comments about this model.  Take a look at the people who are frustrated; although their comments are likely fully warranted, many have updates to their original post noting that the company was making it right.  I see most of the frustration is with customer service, but it sounds like the management is probably reviewing these posts and trying to make it right.  Good help is hard to find these days...customer service is a waning quality in every industry.

But I had to for this one...After reviewing and reviewing and reviewing video monitors before our little one got here, we finally settled on this one, based on price and all the features we wanted! It is a great video monitor, and gives you the peace of mind when you wake up in a fret in the middle of the night. You can just roll over and look at the monitor and see them sleeping peacefully...or tangled up in the crib bars, either way- you know whether or not you need to go in!PROS:-Clear video quality-the picture on it, whether night vision or color vision is amazing. Very clear.-Temperature reading-this feature is SO nice. It's nice to know that the room is 80 degrees or 60 degrees, and how to adjust your thermostat to be just the right temperature. Remember to put it somewhere neutral though, to get an accurate reading. When we were travelling once, we set it in a window sill because thats the only place it would sit, and the temperature reading was an obvious 10 degrees colder than it really was in the room, just because the window was drafty. We have ours mounted on the slant ceiling above the crib, so we know what the temp is right by the crib, where it's most important.-Pan feature-We have a wiggle worm. He will squiggle his way from one end of the crib to the other, all while sleeping, and when I wake up and all I see on the monitor is a foot, I can pan to the left and see his whole body. That feature is nice, as opposed to one that just sits in one fixed position.-Long cords-The charging cord is relatively long, so you can plug it in and have it by you if you want, and not be attached to the wall, practically. Also, the camera cord is super long so you can put it wherever is convenient for you, you really aren't limited.OK Features:-Microphone-This feature only freaks my child out, really. It's not a bad feature, at all. Some children would go back to sleep probably just by hearing their mother or father's voice. Mine, however, hears my voice, then gets all frantic because he can't see me. So this isn't really a feature we use. It did come in handy the other night, though, when my husband went in to calm our son down. He was looking for the pacifier, feeling all over the crib for it, so I used the microphone to tell him where I could see it, and he found it :) So it's nice to use to talk to your spouse if they are in the room, definitely. But to use it for our son was impractical.-Musical feature-Honestly can say, I've never used this. I think it'd be great for a child who loves to listen to music while laying in their crib all peaceful like. But when my son is awake, he wants out of the crib and wants to play. The music would probably just make him angry because he doesn't see a toy attached to it, and it would probably confuse him! But again, if your child likes music, and it's soothing, by all means, use it. It'd be a great feature for you then.CONS:-Range-we have a small cape cod style house. And if I just walk out to the garage, even with the antenna up on the wireless monitor, I lose reception and I get no picture. I'm not sure what the product description says it gets for a range, but in my opinion, it should be a lot farther than it is.-Battery life on monitor when unplugged-could be longer. If the screen is off, it lasts longer, but with the screen on, or if you keep turning the screen on to check on your baby, it wears out pretty quickly. If your child naps for 20 minutes like mine, it's no big deal, really. But sometimes he'll surprise us and sleep for 2 hours and it doesn't last that whole time.-No mute option-We have a white noise machine that we play in our son's room, and the microphone picks up on that really good, so all night long, we hear the white noise machine in our bedroom. It'd be nice if there was a mute option, so that we could just use the video portion. This might only come in handy for us, since our son's room is right next to ours, so we hear him cry through the wall, and we don't need that audio sometimes. If your child's room is far away from yours, obviously you wouldn't use the mute function, but for us, it'd be nice to just use the video function since we can hear if he cries right from our room.Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this product. It's great, and will definitely buy one again for our next child's room!!", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent baby monitor", "Author": "Cristiano Canzone", "ReviewID": "R1KSJMUB71YW9Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a lot of research I decided to buy this baby monitor.

The operation is very easy, very intuitive, there is no need to read the user manual.Despite of its size, the display is awesome. The video quality is excellent and you have a great view of the subject. The infrared works perfectly, I tested it on a windowless room with zero light and I could see the smallest details of the room.The microphone has a great quality too, if you max the volume you can hear the baby breathing (of course if the camera is close to the crib). I liked a lot of the two-way intercom, so we can talk to the baby without going to his room, what is good in some situations where he is half awake and just need to hear our voice to calm down. The camera also plays a few lullabies, what is nice too.Another plus is the temperature sensor on the camera. It works perfectly, we tested it with the air conditioning and it was very accurate, so we can check if the room temperature has changed too much without getting out of bed.There is only one thing that disappointed us: there is no way to find the AV cable in the US (to connect the monitor to a TV and see the baby on the big screen). We had to order one directly from Binatone (the real manufacturer, Motorola just distribute it) in United Kingdom.

The issues I had with the unit originally (since I was comparing it at first use to a non-video Philips Avent that had those particular features) have softened.  I found that I got used to the lack of physical volume buttons (after a few months, you can navigate the menus with your eyes closed), the ability to take the volume to zero doesn't seem to matter to me as much now that I am not used to it, and the missing VOX feature would still be nice but isn't enough to warrant any less than 5 stars.

But as a mother of a toddler and an infant, I feel I owe something to mothers out there everywhere (and a few dads, but realistically, it's us moms researching the heck out of these things and over-analyzing every product and every review trying to get the best for our time and money).  I have been through three video monitors, and this one is the best by far.  The quality is fantastic, the sound is crystal clear (and no buzzing or white noise in the background like other monitors have), the unit is small and VERY portable.  Like some other reviews said, it does have a short battery life.  But we mostly use it at night when we can plug it in next to our bed, so that's not been an issue for us. The bells and whistles are great - love the talk back feature, love the lullabies (sounds silly, but when our infant son's music goes off, it will wake him up and he gets upset...I can just hit a button without going in and voila! more music until he drifts into a deeper sleep), LOVE the pan and tilt feature.  When you have a squirmy kid, what good does a monitor do you if you can only see half of the crib and the kiddo has wormed their way to the other side?  Plus, when we eventually buy more camera units, it will be great to have that in the playroom and our toddler's room so we can see what's going on.  We have only has this a short time, so I hope nothing quits on us, but so far, I'm a huge fan.  I didn't want to spend this much on a monitor - I reviewed all the middle of the pack ones that were less expensive, but this had everything we would ever need and so many before me had given it great reviews.  I will join that list - this is an excellent product.  Look no further.  Do what you can to spend the extra money and get this unit.

The quality is great, the picture and screen are excellent and the extra features (pan, zoom, music, talk-back, & temperature) are fantastic and more than I could ever ask for.However, the design has some flaws that I'm highly disappointed with. The parents' unit power button is TINY and hard to find without looking. The volume cannot be completely turned down/off (muted) like with the Summer Infant which is very disruptive in the middle of the night when I get up with the baby while my husband continues to sleep. Also, the volume has to be accessed thru the menu and not with a direct button. The video on/off button on the parents' unit is located in an inconvenient spot that is also hard to find without looking (tough in the middle of the night) and right next to the talk-back button (be careful or you'll wake the baby). There is no belt clip which is another HUGE inconvenience. The battery doesn't seem to last as long as the Summer Infant, but works well for our use.It's almost as if parents were not involved with the design or testing of this product.

If you are planning to sleep train your child or if you have a fussy sleeper prone to waking up random times through the night crying out or just babbling, the options to not turn the volume off was a huge pain! My child is a poor sleeper so I decided to purchase a video monitor.  I had tried a summer infant monitor and liked that when my child began to cry, I could simply mute the monitor and watch her to ensure she was ok (without waking my husband).

I have a camera in each of my children's rooms, so the auto-scan feature (scans between cameras every 8 seconds) is excellent- I know I will hear if either child wakes in the night.  Many other multi-camera setups require you to switch between cameras manually, which doesn't work if you are sleeping.  This is excellent for our peace of mind with two young kids each in their own rooms on a different floor of the house.Another great feature for an older child is the intercom.

He knows that mommy will tell him over the camera when he is allowed to get out of bed in the morning or after a nap.Also, the pan is exceptional and very quiet.

But I couldn't have made a better choice.  This camera is simply the BEST one out there.  If you want a reliable wireless video monitor, then this is the one for you.  It simply works and works flawlessly! From being able to control the camera with the parental unit (pan, tilt, zoom), adjusting the volume, talking to your baby (yes, the parental unit has a mic built into it! - it isn't 2-way though, but still a very nice touch!), playing soothing melodies, fantastic night vision quality in addition to color video, to having a kickstand to make the parental unit portable, this is one versatile monitor!Did I mention the awesome 3.5\" screen? I can see why this one sells more than the smaller screens (that plus all the bells and whistles on the parental unit).  The mic on the camera is so sensitive that it can pick up sound from a floor above or below, which you hear through the parental unit.  The volume settings on the parental unit are plenty strong too - in fact, having it higher than a \"4\" just isn't needed.

Comes in really handy when trying to tell hubby something without walking across the house or to tell the kids to play nice.Music plays. Too loud and irritating for us but if you like it, it's a good feature.Can add an additional camera. It will switch between the 2 though.

That's nice to have so you know if the room is getting to cold or hot for your little one when they're sleeping.The bad parts....The picture isn't as clear as I'd like. It's pretty blurry compared to our other older analog monitor. The zoom is just even blurrier and useless.Occasionally it will beep saying the signal is gone but I don't know why. It does it in the middle of the night when nothing has been moved or changed. It's loud and wakes us up and there's no way to turn down the volume on the beeping. It's extremely irritating. It will beep \"no signal\" then switch right back to a picture of the room, then beep \"no signal\" again for a split second. I hoped it would have a stronger signal for being digital. My house has very little interference and it does this whether it's near or far to the room monitor. My analog one never has issues picking up the signal.Worst feature - there's no time on the display! When your kid is crying in the middle of the night, the first thing you do is check the time...how long have they been sleeping, do they need to eat, is it morning time yet, how much sleep have I NOT gotten, etc. I ALWAYS check the time because it clues me into what the problem might be.

Video is clear in IR and Color.  It clearly does not look like what you see in the product sample photo, but it is in line with a $200 monitor video quality.  No complaints about the audio capture.  The camera does not make any noise when rotating and the IR lights don't shine red at night.  Bottom line is that the camera unit is what I expected from a unit of this price.However, I did find a few issues with the monitor device.  Perhaps I have noticed these because we switched from a Summer monitor that did not have these problems.  So here are my issues with the handheld monitor device:1. Let's say you want to zoom in (digit zoom only).  The only way to do this is to go in to the menu, click the right arrow about 5 times, change the setting to 2x and then get out of the menu.  Then you have to repeat the process again to go back to 1x.  In comparison, our Summer monitor had a tiny joystick which you could click to zoom in.2. The display button is poorly placed.  The display button will be the only button you press when the baby is sleeping since it turns on the LCD screen.  It is also a button that you will use the most.  The problem is that the button is tiny and located right above the microphone button.  So, when you are trying to click on display (especially at night), there is a high chance that the mic will be pressed.  This is really a non issue after a few days of use since you learn where the button is located, but I just think that it is a major design fail.

Since there is very little you can criticize the MBP36 on I figured I'd provide you what little features it lacks that I found wanting it to have after 3+ months of use. I won't waste time talking up all the Pros except to say picture (especially night mode), battery life, zoom, tilt/pan, room temp, camera mounting options and two way intercom features are all outstanding and as advertised.  I've also had no range or interference issues either and monitor white noise is tolerable.  With the additional cameras now available we will soon be adding a second cam for baby's play area.Tweaks I'd like to see:- a larger power on/off button that is also illuminated for easy finding at night.  I've spent more time than acceptable searching for this little button at the top of the monitor unit.  Again not enough to outweigh all the Pros but annoying.- luminescence on the monitor's side buttons for easy finding from the bedside.  Again at night this is a hit or miss operation due to the inability to either see or feel these buttons in the dark.  I guess the designers thought a sleek and smooth monitor surface outweighed the utility of having 3-D relief on the buttons for locating by feel-- Which would be completely unnecessary if the buttons were subtly illuminated but why not add both features.  In the light these buttons have icons on them to tell it's the menu, transmit, tilt up/down, pan left/right etc.- The ability to add a second monitor...again not a deal breaker as long as the battery continues to perform at it's current level.  According to Motorola's customer service adding a second monitor is not possible and for most consumers I would imagine not necessary.  We utilized the monitor during the day and charged at night, keeping the charger at the bedside.  So far we've experienced no battery life issues.  But I do wonder what the corrective action is once the battery life is complete.  I don't believe the monitor's battery is replaceable; which means Motorola either expects you to buy an entirely new system or estimates you'll be done requiring a monitor before batteries loses it's recharge-ability. Hmm, what about having more than one child or wanting to allow your sister to use the monitor when you're done with it b/c she'll be delivering just when you'll be ready go off the baby monitor.  Or what about simply wanting to sell it second hand but now you have to tell the buyer it works great but battery mode doesn't work.  We'll be lucky to $20 for it...sorry to digress.- The monitor needs a replaceable, rechargeable battery.

If you need a wider angle on the camera, I would recommend mounting it higher on the wall.  Since we use it to watch 2 girls in 2 beds, we frequently have to move it back and forth to see each girl.  There is a zoom feature, but it makes the picture grainier than I like.There have been some reviews that the battery runs down quickly, but I've found that unless you turn the monitor off BEFORE plugging in the charger, the battery does not charge fully.  Once the battery is charged fully, it will go 2-3 hours easily with occasional checking on the camera.  I plug it in at night with it on and the battery doesn't run down since it is being charged as it is used.  However, I turn it off and plug it back in after we get up so that it is fully charged for nap time.  The camera will go to sleep just like a computer monitor which helps save the battery too.  To turn it back on, simply press the camera button.  Once you've used it for a little while during the day, it is easy to find the button at night in the dark.  I have not had a problem at all as some have complained about.We have not added an additional camera yet, but plan to for the new baby on the way.  We have had this monitor for about a month and love it!

After doing some serious research and reading many reviews I decided to go with this one. We received it a couple of days ago. This monitor is very nice and convenient. The signal is strong. We have not had an issue with disconnecting at all. As a matter of fact we have not even lost one bar of signal between the camera and handheld unit. The screen is just the right size. Not too big, not too small. It has a pretty nice display. I have nothing to compare it to so I'm not sure if it is above or below average. Although I will say I was kind of hoping for a nicer display. Like I said I wasn't sure what to expect but after seeing rave reviews about the display quality I had visions of a HDTV like experience with the handheld unit. This is definitely not the case. However, it is still pretty nice. The panning feature is awesome. Greatest thing about the monitor. It is so quite. I thought I would hear the motor every time. But nothing. It is really nice. Night vision is pretty good. I was really relieved there weren't any lights that had to be on for this feature. I didn't want my little one to wake and and see an eight red or white eyed monster staring at her. The only light on the camera is a little green light showing the camera is on. It's not that bright. People have reviewed the night vision is crisp and clear. Even stating they can see their child breathing. While this is somewhat true, again, as I stated above, I was expecting an HDTV like experience. Again, this is not the case. However, it does the job and it not that bad. I have not used the mic feature yet but it is a nice option. The handheld unit UI is very simple and user friendly. I have seem some bad comments about the speaker being on the back. I have not had any issues with this. The speaker is plenty loud.Some things I don't like about the monitor:-No external volume button (It really is not that big of a deal. You just hit the menu button>up or down arrow but it would be nice. Some reviewers have make a really big deal about this. It's really not)-Button are not back-lit. This can be a pain sometimes but again not a huge deal.-Acts as digital camera? I think maybe this is wrong. Have not seen it anywhere. I didn't buy it for this feature but if this is a deciding factor for getting this monitor just be aware; I don't think it has this feature.-No mute option. It would be nice to be able to turn off the volume when you want to. This would specifically be nice when playing the lullabies.-Another feature I would like to see it the ability to be able to turn on a light on the camera at night. (Too picky?)All of these cons are not a deal breaker for me. Just things I would like to see on the next model that would make this monitor perfect.I know it seems like I have beat up the display but I don't want to give the wrong impression. Just based on the reviews I was expecting an HD like display. Even though it was not the display is still very nice and probably the best one on the market. I do not want to turn off any one who is deciding to get this monitor. I just wanted to put things into perspective. I would recommend this monitor to anyone and actually already have.All in all, a great monitor. I have no regrets with getting this monitor at all and feel it is a must. It is really cool to see what your child is doing and I really feel this is going to pay off when she gets older and is starting to walk and play in her room. I am planning to get another camera later on so I can see her whole room when she gets a little bit older. If you are on the fence about getting this camera I hope this review helps you out.

I read the other reviews for some of the other monitors and decided on this one because of its features.  The thing that sold me was the remote movement of the camera which is absolutely necessary with this model.The picture is clear, slightly clearer than the Summer Infant monitor, but probably due to the larger, crisper screen.  The hand-held unit is a nice, portable size, but doesn't have clip or anything to attach it to you when you're walking around the house.  The controls and icons are fairly intuitive.  I do wish the buttons would light up when you pick it up or at least had a little bump on them so you knew which button you were pressing, but it's not a deal breaker.  True, the volume is nested in a menu, but it's not hard to adjust and I don't find myself needing to adjust it all the time.The reason why the remote camera movement is necessary with this monitor is because the focal length is not very wide.  I placed the camera in the same position as the old monitor's camera and I could only see a zoomed in portion of the crib, so I do find myself moving the camera around when our son rolls around the crib.  The movement is pretty quiet and he doesn't notice when the camera is moving.The talk-back feature is pretty cool.  But it confuses the heck out of my kid.  It's kinda fun watching him scan the room when I talk to him, trying to figure out where my voice is coming from.  The remote music feature is kinda lame as the sound is not soothing (think old 90s midi) and is a little harsh sounding.I do think this monitor is a little over-priced, but not a waste of money.

You have to control the volume by going to the menu and using the up and down arrows. It would be nicer to have a knob.2. The music that plays is actually louder on the monitor than whats coming out of the camera and you have to listen to the music over the monitor. My baby is in bed. I would like to spend some time with my wife without listening to anything targeted at people under the age of 10.3. Finally, there is no way to mute the ambient sound on the monitor. The cheap non-video monitor we had before this had an option to \"mute\" when the baby was sleeping but turned on when he started moving or crying.

It gave me some GREAT information - to which I should have listened to...  (note that my first baby monitor was the Summer Sleek Video Baby Monitor - which I LOVED but am now having a second child and want the \"talk\" and \"pan/zoom\" feature - hence my need for a new monitoring system).The author was totally on-point, it all comes down to the minor details that are important to you.  The deal-breakers for me were a) the battery life, b) the fact that you could not \"mute\" the sound on the Motorola (and, no, the lowest setting does not equal \"mute\" because the speaker is on the back of the unit as stated in the above review) c) the volume being in a menu instead of a prominant button on the unit itself.Battery Life:  My previous monitor never had any issues in this department.  When I went to bed at night, it still had plenty of battery left and I would charge every night.  With the Motorola, it wouldn't last for over 4 hours.  If I'd forget to put it back on the charger in the middle of the night, it would lose battery by morning.  Not to mention the SUPER annoying and constant beeping when the battery was low - not loud enough to wake you in the middle of the night but plenty loud and constant to annoy you in the middle of the day.No Mute:  This was my biggest hesitation in buying this unit and I should have listened to my instincts.  This feature is KEY in the middle of the night when you wake up and are attempting to determine whether to go into your child's room.  \"Waiting it out\" becomes very hard to do when you can't mute the volume while still watching the screen in an effort to give your spouse some additional sleep.  I'd have to leave the room with the monitor in order to \"wait it out\" in the hall or another room if I didn't want to disturb my spouse.  This is the main reason for returning the Motorola.Volume:  Whoever decided to put the volume inside a menu instead of outside on a button obviously never has had a baby.  Again, in the middle of the night, it is KEY to be able to navigate the volume quickly and easily, one-handed, in a semi-sleepy state.  The Motorola doesn't allow for that.  You need two hands and you need to navigate a menu to get to the volume - granted, its the first menu selection so I could probably get over it but its an annoyance thats unneeded in the middle of the night.Another feature (not a deal-breaker) that I miss from my old Summer unit is the ability to clip the monitor to you.  Although I didn't use it frequently, it was a nice-to-have when running around the house, outside or if you just plain have your hands full.Hope this helps!", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "No Sound", "Author": "JennyO", "ReviewID": "R2AP7KH2OUDJ9S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Well this was a great monitor but only lasted 4 months before we had no sound.

I ended up returning the first unit and purchasing another since I thought it was defective, but the second unit is having the same problems. Basically, when I try to turn the monitor on it will display a blank white screen without any image or sound. The only way to fix this is to reset both the monitor and camera, which requires unscrewing the monitor case, unplugging the battery, then unplugging the camera and then reversing this procedure to reconnect everything.

The ability to tilt and pan is great, and worth the upgrade from the 2.8\" screen model if you're on the fence.2. The temperature reading on the screen is definitely helpful.3. The large LCD makes it easier to verify that our baby is breathing (my wife watches for chest movement to confirm).Con's:1. Every once in awhile it'll drop a signal (seemingly, it happens mostly in the middle of the night!) even though we're not moving the unit at all. It'll then let out a series of loud beeps which wake us up immediately, and is very frustrating.2. There's no time display on the unit, which would be nice for timing how often our baby wakes up or how long he's been crying for (we give him a few minutes to self-settle before entering his room).3. The display can be very bright especially if your baby's crib and sleep outfits are in light colors. Even on the lowest setting, the LCD will illuminate most of our bedroom if we have the LCD close to the baby. The brightness is reduced by placing the camera farther away, but then my wife can't see him breathing (see pro #3 above).I've left out some of the pro's and con's already covered by others, but felt the above items were worthy enough to call out for potential buyers of this unit.Bottom-line: It's not a perfect monitor, but it's pretty darn close!", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not Worth the Money: Poor Battery Life, Poor Night Vision, ...", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R3FR6KNS3Y5GNQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Pros:- Great signal strength- Easy to set up- Thermometer function works really wellCons:- Poor batter life (didn't last the entire night on a full charge and the battery was new)- Poor night vision (I expected a whole lot better night vision quality for a roughly $250 monitor)- Controls really hard to operate in the dark (no tactile clues or backlighting of the keys)- Lullaby sounds sounded extremely loud through the hand held unit (perhaps I need to turn the sound way way down, but what about when I switched over to no Lullaby?

The monitor is pretty compact and fairly flat, about the size and depth of an iPhone inside an Otterbox case, and the appearance is pretty streamlined, too. The picture is pretty crisp, and the ability to zoom is nice. BUT, the 1X (regular) viewing area is smaller than on my previous Summer Infant monitor (which I still have, but wanted the additional features this one offers) - when both are placed fairly high on the wall (about one foot from the ceiling) above my daughter's full-sized bed, I can see pretty much the whole  bed on the Summer Infant monitor, but only most of the upper third to half of the bed on this monitor, which I guess is okay, but since she moves around a lot, it would be nice to be able to see the entire bed at a glance (but I can, of course, pan down to see the rest). This wouldn't be an issue, however, for babies, since the 1X setting would probably perfectly show the entire crib. As I mentioned, it does have zoom, but only 1X and 2X, with 2X seeming just a little too close for me (can see lips moving!) but perfect for a nervous new parent (can see breathing, probably!). The MAIN reason I bought this one is because my daughter is suddenly experiencing serious SEPARATION ANXIETY (esp fears of us leaving - WHY, I don't know!!) at night, so we thought the ability to talk BACK to her when she calls (versus having to run to her room to comfort her, before she tries to make a run to OUR room) is nice, and seemed to help a little last night (the first night), although she DID eventually make it over to our room and had to sleep there (oh well). The lullaby music is a nice option, and comes out pretty clear and not too loud. I haven't used this yet, so I don't know if it would be soothing, but it'll be interesting to see! The temperature reading is pretty cool (tells you the room temp in baby's room), especially if you're the mom of a really young one (who can't sleep with blankets, like an older child) and you want to make sure they're warm enough through the night when the temps drop in the cold, cold winter (maybe want to put on another layer, or tuck a small blanket around the baby). The ONLY real complaint I have, then (since viewing area really is perfect for a baby's crib, not so much for a larger bed), is that there's NO BELT CLIP!

It was not off of a registry and the person who gave it to us has since passed-away.  I explained this, but was told that the only way the warranty is valid is if I can provide a receipt.  I am unable to do that, so I was told that I would have to purchase a new monitor.  I was a bit shocked that customer service wasn't willing to try to get their product working.

I had the Angelcare Baby Movement and Sound Monitor Deluxe Plus, Blue up until this point and just gave it to a family member with a newborn.  It didn't have video, but had other things that worked perfectly for a worried mom.I had to start looking for a monitor for both kids, that will be in the same room together, so i began to look for a video monitor that could pan across the room.  There aren't an incredible amount to choose from with 3 stars or more.  I think the Summer Infant Baby Touch Digital Color Video Monitor and Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision had the best reviews, aside from the Motorola monitor.This Motorola seemed to be exactly what i was looking for.It has alot of great pros:-video is great.  i have a friend with the summer infant video monitor and the video on this seems just as good if not better.-video is fine in light and dark.-video pans across, up and down.-speaker is good.  even though it's on the back of the unit, it works just fine in my opinion.-the temperature gage is built into the unit, which is nice to see- although if the camera unit is not near the child's bed, it doesn't necessarily serve it's purpose (if the room doesn't have good circulation if you've got it at the top corner ceiling of the bedroom, for example)-the monitor and camera look nice and are compact for the most part.  unisex colors (white and dark brown/maroon)-there is a microphone built in, so you can talk to the baby through the monitor.  i didn't ever understand why this was cool, until i tried it!  i've used this feature a few times and the baby calms down, just out of mere curiosity of where your voice is.-price isn't a complete deterrent.  anything under 250 is reasonable to me, after spending so much on baby stuff.BIG con:-battery life.  i spent 200 on amazon for this product.  if i'm spending this on something, it should have atleast 4 hours of battery life, right?  um, no.  apparently motorola makes their phones with better battery life than this.  my Angelcare monitor lasted 10 hours during the night, after being plugged in for JUST PART of the day (minus a 2 hour nap).  Instructions say to plug the motorola unit in for 16 hours before use.  I did that.  Then i used it, and it gave me about 4 hours of unplugged battery life- without video and ONLY audio.  Then i had to plug it in for the remainder of the night for just audio.  What if i'm doing things around the house while the baby is sleeping?  What if the sitter needs the plug and can't find the plug?  So, we have to move it all around the house in order to keep the silly thing plugged in.  I want a monitor that was created with battery life in mind for non-stationary parents.  We can go to the moon and back, so why in the world can't i have a baby monitor made by a huge corporation with more than 4 hours of battery life?  I like this monitor very much, but based on this, my review is 3 stars.I would also like to note that I was shipped a brand new 2011 version.  I had to RETURN this particular item because the power button STOPPED working properly after 5 days of use.  I noticed this battery life problem at that point and thought maybe i just had a defective unit overall.  I was glad i bought it from amazon and was able to exchange.I asked for an exchange, and was shipped the 2010 version.  I haven't had a problem with the power button, but the battery life problem is consistent between both 2011 and 2010 models so far.Overall, if you don't have a problem keeping your unit plugged in literally all but 4 hours a day, then this is definitely a fantastic monitor.  But if you want more for your money, think twice before purchasing.  As of right now, i'm looking for a monitor that has similar features but better battery life.

I was doubtful that we needed the more expensive version at first, with pan/zoom capabilities. But, I'm really glad we have it now, as my baby likes to move around his crib. Also, the monitor is portable (something the Angelcare monitor is not). We plan on taking it with us when we stay at my Mom's house this summer. The camera has a wall mount, which is handy, and the receiving screen is big enough to be seen from across the room.Cons: There's no mute button.

UGH. 2) There's no clip so no easy way to secure it to your pants when you are walking around the house or in the backyard. 3) the video quality has seriously degraded over time.

Also, I liked the lullaby and temperature features it has that the Summer does not.HOWEVER, I also wanted my monitor to be able to connect to a TV or other video source.  While this item's description says that it can with the appropriate cable (mini usb), it in fact cannot (or I could not find a cable that would work anyway).  I used the cable that was included with the Summer monitor (which works with the Summer).  It was mini usb and 2 prong rca.  No luck.  I tried numerous other cables, no luck.  I then called Motorola, who acted confused when I alerted them they even had a baby monitor line.  I was tossed around to different departments, put on hold, and hung up on.  I called back and left a message on VM with one of the techs to please call me back concerning the matter, and never heard back.The monitor works great if you never want to hook it to a tv.

This one seemed to have the best reviews, so I took the leap and purchased this model.  We couldn't be happier.  When you are expecting your little one, you always think of your baby in their crib.  In reality, they spend much of their first few months in your room in a basinet (at least that was the case for us).  Even then, there are times you might want to travel to see grandparents, or maybe you want to transition your baby into his or her crib slowly.  In each case, having a monitor that you can easily move from room to room is important.  This monitor is so easy.  Literally just plug in the camera and prop it up to see the baby.  Then plug in the handset or make sure it is charged.  Simple.  We have a two story house and often the baby is sleeping on the complete opposite end.  No interference problems.  Good picture for a monitor.  Easy to move the camera around from the handset.  The handset holds a decent charge, but you'll have to plug it in for overnight use.  Overall, couldn't be more pleased.And one note for those considering purchasing a monitor that combines a movement monitor.  Those must be placed under a crib mattress and cannot be placed under a basinet.  Your baby will most likely spend some time in your room in a basinet where the breathing monitor cannot be used.

We had a summer monitor for DD#1 but needed something for DD#2. This fits our needs perfectly. You can adjust which camera you are looking at by simply pressing the \"ok\" button to switch between cam1, cam2 or scan. If not plugged in, the screen on the parental unit turns off but the audio remains on either 1 of the cameras or scanning, however you left it. If the parental unit is plugged in the screen can be left on. You can turn the vol off completely and the lights at the top of the monitor indicate noise.A friend came to visit and brought her same monitor with 2 cameras for her kids, we were both able to watch our own kids without changing any settings on either monitor and without any interference.The only signal issue we have had was if the microwave is running, the monitor beeps to indicate loss of signal then returns to normal function when the microwave turns off.Cons: the battery life is not great and it would be nice if they sold an extra power cord. Don't buy the knock off cord from Amazon! i plugged this cord in and without attaching it to the unit there was a \"pop\" and puff of smoke at the outlet.  I called the company and was refuneded, they offered to replace it but I couldn't rish burning down my house.Customer service is fantastic!  Not related to the faulty knock off power cord... the parental unit was plugged into the wall with the motorola power cord, we went to turn it off and there was a static discharge that killed the unit. It was past warrantee so I contacted by credit card company for extended warantee. I had to call motorola for an estimate to replace the unit for the claim and motorola generously replaced the parental unit! They also had us replace one of the cameras. I'm not sure if the replacement handheld and camera were referbished or new... the \"new\" parental unit does not power down normally, I have to push and hold the power button while the unit cycles through powerdown several times before turning off. Also, after only 2 months of using the new camera the night vision was very poor. I called customer service again and they are replacing the camera for me.

A product this expensive should not break this easily with no options from the company for repair.I'll start off by saying that we like this monitor. It has good range, screen visibility (we have the 3.5\") and sound. We have an almost 2 year old and a 4 month old and we have bought two additional cameras so we have one in each of their rooms and one in the garage for when the baby falls asleep in the car. I love that you can hook up to 4 cameras up to it. However, to be honest, it is tough to have it keep switching between the two rooms so we ended up getting a sound only monitor they we have permanently on in our older sons room and only check him on the camera if we need to. We have had to replace the battery once (which seems reasonable in two years) and the power cord twice as it seems to easily bend and break/fray at the connection point (not quite as reasonable but not a huge deal).Fast forward to a little under two years after we bought and the on/off switch on the monitor stopped functioning rendering it totally useless. Because we already had three cameras we did purchase another. It stopped working right before the kids bedtime and we sort of panicked and just ran out and replaced it with the same thing since the cameras were already set up in their rooms. So we had to spend another $250 on the monitor and an additional camera (which we don't really need).I called customer service the next day hoping there was some way we could repair or replace the broken monitor. We are planning to have at least one more kid so a second monitor may come in handy and it would help rationalize having to spend another $250 + tax on a second monitor - at least we would have two monitors. The customer service rep said that they only have a one year warranty on it and there was nothing they could do for me. Not totally unreasonable but, for the price, I was definitely expecting to be able to use it for longer than 2 years. I am really hoping the new one lasts longer.

Motorola has easy changes that could make a big difference.  The direction buttons could be a rocking single button vs. 4 buttons in a row.  In the middle of the night I can never remember which button is left vs. right when they are all stacked on each other in a column.  This needs to have a 5 minute silence button, if you're with your honey in bed and have to go get the baby, no need to keep everyone up with the monitor when one parent is taking care of the little one, also if you are doing Ferber or just giving your little one some time to settle down on their own, it would be nice to be able to \"time\" them on the monitor.  My little one fusses between her sleep cycles, but if it's longer than 5 minutes I know there's a problem, I can't keep track of time in the middle of the night, a 5 minute silence feature would be great.  Or if you want to stand outside the room and watch your little one on the monitor but not have them hear the monitor... another reason a silence feature would be helpful.  I don't know why the volume adjustment isn't a dial or an easy button, on here you have to open the menu, make sure you're on the volume selection then adjust it.  Not easy with a column of direction buttons in the middle of the night.  The warming alarms are from the 1980's.  They have 2 beeps, but there's no reason they can't be more musical in nature... a 3 tone tune telling you the device is running out of batteries could easily be distinguished from an electronic zap sound showing that you're out of range.  It's just a loud obnoxious beep, and I can't tell which is which until I run to the monitor trying to get it to be quiet while my little one is sleeping.

It has a large screen, has very clear night vision, has some great features that can be used on the remote device and - the coolest part - is that you can control the camera from your end to move around as needed.. so that you can track your baby as he travels from one end of the crib to the other.

However, after owning it for several weeks now, and using it during nap time and overnight, we are a little disappointed with this product.  Here's why:1. The BATTERY LIFE stinks. I use it through nap time and into the early evening.  But by the time my husband and I go to bed, the monitor has been shut down for about an hour because the battery can't make it through the day.  And I don't leave the device on when the kiddo is out of bed.2. NIGHT VISION is subpar.  It's really, really grainy...so much so, that I sometimes can't tell if an object is my kid or a stuffed animal.  We also own a Summer Infant video monitor from 2010, and the night vision on that tiny screen is way better than this newer, bigger monitor.3. The ZOOM is a total farse.  It's 2x digital zoom, and combined with the above-mentioned night vision graininess, looks like digital technology from the mid-1990's.  Not appropriate for the price point on this monitor.

Cole", "ReviewID": "ROGFCHHHD8UA9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bottom Line Up Front:  I could highly recommend this camera if hadn't stopped recognizing that it was plugged in after less than two years service.  That's not a decent value for a monitor costing this much.UPDATE: After further investigating I found that the power cord had become damaged at the strain relief on the DC transformer. That's why the viewscreen/receiver would no longer stay powered. A trip to RadioShack yielded an appropriate 6 VDC 800 milliamp transformer with a tip that, while a bit too long, does work. So, I'm out a bit of time and $25 but at least it's back up and running. I raised the review one star.Pros:  We were generally very pleased with the baby monitor as far as the performance.  We positioned the camera on the wall near the baby's crib about 6 or 7 feet away from the mattress.  It has very good clarity in daylight, and the night-time picture with the IR diodes providing the illumination is sufficient to see what's going on with the baby.  Range is decent.  We have clear reception through two walls and 25 feet or so, and can even get decent reception through 3 walls and another 10-15 feet (35-40 ft total range with 3 walls).Cons:  The screen shuts off every few minutes if not plugged in.  I'm sure this is a power saving feature.  The motor makes some noise when moved to adjust camera, but it's not too noticeable to the baby, and certainly not enough to wake her.Show Stopper!!:  The problem is that after owning this for 20 months, it suddenly wouldn't charge when plugged in.  We've been pretty gentle with the monitor/cord interface.  It has been tripped over a few times.  I haven't spent much time trying to troubleshoot if it's the plug or something going on with the rechargeable batteries, but finding this out at our bedtime didn't encourage me to add any stars.

You see, if your product is not under warranty you are basically up the creek without a paddle.  The company that makes this product is based in Hong Kong and London, after the warranty is up all they give you is a email to write to if you have a defective product and the email might as well be a black hole because from what I can tell after sending several emails no one cares or even responds.

When baby started moving around a lot in his crib we moved the camera back onto the wall where he couldn't reach the cord, and at that point could no longer see enough detail to see breathing. That's about 5 feet from the crib.We also used this even when baby was sleeping in our room, because in the dark it was easier to peek at the screen and see what was going on than to try and lean over the bassinet.  We also really liked the sound indicator lights so that we have the option to turn off the sound but still see if baby is making noise and how loud.  The range on the parent screen unit is pretty good.

This is my 3rd video monitor and 3rd different brand. When I initially set it up, this one was the best of the 3. Unfortunately due to room set up, 2 of the cameras had to be fairly far away from my older children, leaving the picture of a slightly lesser, grainy quality, but still good enough to serve its function. The camera over the crib was much closer and the picture was great. My monitor remains plugged in 99% of the time, which should mean the picture is functioning all the time, but after about 9 months, the monitor started going in to sleep mode (black screen but sound working) randomly. This monitor does not have a feature where once sound is detected the screen comes back on if in sleep mode, like some other monitors, and requires you to reach over and push a menu button to bring the screen back up. This was pretty annoying, but the monitor still functioned the majority of the time, so not terribly concerning. As time passed it started happening more frequently. Then last Monday the monitor finally flat out died. It won't power up at all.Fortunately it is about 6 weeks before my 1 year warranty expires. Unfortunately, Motorola customer service sucks. I placed a claim Tuesday morning and they told me it takes 3 business days to process the claim and ship a new unit. They will not email you when your claim has been processed to provide a tracking number. If you want to be able to track your package, YOU have to call THEM and ask for your tracking number. I called Friday and was told it was shipping out that day and was given a tracking number. When I expressed concern about how long the process was taking because I had now been without my monitor for 4 nights and my 3 year old was having nightmares and waking up screaming that there were bugs in her bed, and the poor thing had to wait for me to wake up from hearing her scream from the other end of the house, the customer service rep LAUGHED! HYSTERICALLY! It was so inappropriate the humor she found in my poor child's terror and my concern over not getting to her fast enough, and ultimately the attitude was it will get there when it gets there. After tracking my package it is going to take a full 7 days to arrive, leaving me without a monitor for a total of 11 nights. For any parent with small children, this is just not OK. And for the cost of the monitor you would think they could throw in overnight shipping if a unit malfunctions.So overall, when it works, this is a pretty good monitor. I was very happy with it for the first 9 months. However I would hate to be that person whose monitor stops working 6 weeks AFTER the warranty expires. Your not going to have anything but a paperweight and no one will care.

Tilara \"owtfoymmom\"", "ReviewID": "RQW0N4ROMB1ME", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying that this baby monitor far surpasses the others in the market in very many ways. First and foremost, the picture quality is excellent both during day and night hours. The infra-red night vision functions great and the sound quality is AWESOME! Even in a pitch black room, I can see exactly where my baby is, and count his breaths. The infra red light is also quite dim and does not interfere with baby's sleep in any way. The room temperature monitor is a good indicator of baby's comfort level, however, at times i feel as if it's a bit off. Also, the placement of the camera (near a window or ac/duct/heater vent) might lead to a temperature difference between the parent unit and baby's actual bed area. So that is definitely something to keep in mind. My son loves the lullabies built in, and for a long time I relied upon them to put him back to sleep. The two way communication feature is also cool and saves me many trips into baby's bedroom when I'd rather let him get himself settled. Voice quality is crystal clear. The tilt and pan features are also great and extremely useful with an overactive baby. The fact that you can carry the monitor around without it needing to be plugged in, is for me, one of the most useful features. Oh and the monitor has taken quite a few rough bangs and still does its job well. However, the range mentioned here is 200 meters....the MAIN reason why I chose this monitor, since i wanted to be able to get my elder daughter from her bus stop while being secure in my mind that baby was safe in his crib.  And let me tell you, it's NOWHERE near that. They conveniently forgot to mention that walls and trees can interfere and get the range down to abt 30 metres. This I got to know while reading the manual. So that was a big negative for me. Also another feature that annoys me a lot is how I can't choose to mute the microphone completely. So even when baby's throwing a tantrum and I choose not to be in the room with him I am forced to listen to his screams.All said and done, this is a great monitor that I have recommended to many of my friends.

For normal video quality (color mode) the image is not as crisp as I thought it would be but then again Motorola never promised full HD or retina display for this product, right? I opted for a camera monitor with a display after reading all the connectivity issues with wi-fi monitors (I had considered those to use with my iphone) and I think I made the right choice since it is fairly simple to use and I don't have to worry about synching issues or the iphone app closing on me during the night. Both the handheld display and the camera look robust and I believe the rechargeable battery included can eventually be replaced.

I LOVED that monitor but I was looking for one that would scan between my daughters' rooms throughout the night. This monitor has been perfectly adequate, but not what I expected for the price.Pros: -decent quality video (not crystal clear but works great for checking in on the kids), it's equal to my infant optics one.-temp read out is a nice feature, my daughter's room is generally hotter than ours so it's easy for me to check if it's too hot in the night.-no creepy red glowing lights for infrared. My daughter used to stare at them constantly with our old one, she never looks at this one.-panning ability is nice. My toddler is on a twin mattress on the floor so I can follow her if she gets up.-parent unit is solid yet portable. It doesn't feel cheap or breakable, but I can easily carry it around with me-great signal. I can use it in my basement or in the backyard easily. No interference at all (it's on, next to my iPad right now)-very easy to use and to pair the camera and extra camera to the parent unitCons: -LOW LOW LOW battery!!!! This is my number one complaint. It lasts MAYBE two hours if you keep the screen off. If you want to keep the screen on to make sure your kid falls asleep, forget it. Currently doing exactly that and the battery is down to 3 out of 4 bars after about 8 minutes.-no VOX (voice activation). Our much cheaper Infant Optics monitor had VOX and it was my favorite feature. If the screen lit up I knew they'd made a noise.  With this one I have to constantly check it (\"was that my kid or was it outside?Is the volume up loud enough for me to hear them of they cry? Oh now it's loud enough to hear them AND the music playing in their room.\") because it doesn't light up. Ok I guess the little lights across the top light up but unless you're staring right at it you won't notice those flash. I leave the monitor on (and plugged in) next to me at night so I can hear if either of my girls wake up but I have to deal with a constant low buzz because we have white noise playing in their rooms. The sound is very clear, there isn't any static, but we do hear their fans and/or music playing. All. Night. Long. I can't turn it down much more because then I wouldn't wake up when they cry. The VOX for the infant optics made a little click noise when it kicked on so I always heard it, but it was totally silently unless they made a noise.-as others have mentioned, the buttons aren't the best. The button you press to light up the screen is the second from the bottom on the right side of the screen, so at night when you're trying to figure out if your kid is awake you can easily hit the Wilkie-talkie button, which is the lowest button on the right. Not very intuitive, and a bit of a design flaw I think. Also the on/off button is very small and you have to hold it for a good 3-5 seconds to turn the unit on or off. Not a big deal but it is a little annoying.If I had a way to scan between rooms I would definitely go back to the infant optics, this is equivalent in most features (video quality, sound quality) but severely lacking in battery life and the VOX feature. It does have some other features that the infant optics doesn't (panning, zoom, temp readout, two-way communication, and lullabies) but honestly we very rarely if ever use any of those, and I'd rather give those up for better battery life and VOX.

I originally thought I would not buy a baby monitor with video, but once we moved my daughter into her own room... I wanted the video. :-)We tried the Drop Cam, which was very easy to set up, and had a wifi connection. Unfortunately the delay on the feed could be up to a minute or more. Plus there was only two way sound which meant when you hear your baby she/he hears you too...So after a ton of research, I decided to go up in price and get the Motorla MBP36. We are so happy with this monitor.Here is the overview:The camera - Has clear a picture and the monitor is a perfect size. One thing I like is you can turn the camera portion on and off on the monitor, which is good for sleeping. The camera has a day mode, which is color and a night vision mode. The night vision mode is great! I can see clearly enough to watch my daughter breath, and I can hear her breathe too. Which brings me to the sound features.Sound Features: You can set the volume on the sound to whatever level you like, and I can hear everything that is happening in and around my daughters room (I love that I can hear my daughter breathe), so the mic is powerful & picks up a lot! Also - you can press a button to talk through the monitor and soothe you little one as well. There are a bunch of lullabies, which we never use but they are there and you can trigger them to play from the monitor.Pan/Tilt: We love that we can remotely operate the camera to focus in on wherever my daughter is in her crib. I love this feature and see it being very useful as my daughter becomes a toddler and is playing in her room. Totally worth the extra $50The monitor in general is very easy to use and to control everything. It displays the temperature in my daughter's room, which I love. Some other reviews said it would be nice if it had a clock and I agree with that.Overall the monitor is awesome and we are so happy we got it!", "Date": "June 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worked perfectly out of the box", "Author": "Lrh13", "ReviewID": "R1ETXH1CPRJGOD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched numerous baby monitors before purchasing this one.

We purchased this because of the ability to remotely operate the camera to see more of our children's room.  This is great for toddler twins on the move.  We are able to see very well with the infrared and daylight.BUT----after four months, our first parent unit stopped working.  I believe it was the sound that stopped working on that one, but am not sure.  Amazon replace it very quickly without hassle.THEN---after three months, the replacement monitor got stuck on SCAN 3, and would not recognize any of the three cameras we have synced to it.  Amazon wanted me to contact Motorola.  I did, and they are sending a second replacement.  But, the warranty is only good for a year from the original date of purchase.  I am not very confident that this parent unit will last for the net few years.I am very disappointed, because I bought this monitor because we had toddler twins and one on the way.  I was hoping it would last until our newborn doesn't need to be monitored at night.  Very expensive for a short duration of use.We had a Summer Infant Slim and Secure with the twins, and it worked very well for two years.  It still works, but the picture is not as good as it first was, and the battery doesn't hold power very long.  At least we are still able to use it while waiting on a replacement.

The picture still works, but there is zero sound rendering the device useless. We just ordered the Lorex LW2450 Baby monitor from amazon and are awaiting its arrival today.  Would not recommend the MBP36 to anyone. Recently had friends who received the MBP36 for a shower gift, and advised them to return it for something else.To start, I LOVE this monitor....when it works.The problem with the monitors is that, despite the high price tag, have clear QA issues.I have gone through three of these monitors all with separate issues:1. The first monitor we got seemed to work just fine, but I noticed that it would only hold 30 minutes of charge brand new out of the box.  We dealt with this for a while then eventually returned it for a replacement.2. This one was working great with a charge, it held a charge for hours on end and we thought we just had a single defective unit.  Not so fast, just a few weeks into using this one, no more sound!  Video came through fine but nothing out of the speaker at all... obviously a major issue with a newborn.3. Finally, the one we are using now.  Held charge fine and sound for the past 4 months.  Last week, it would only work while plugged in, no charge AT ALL.  We have been able to deal with this just by keeping it plugged in wherever we go, but obviously this is highly frustrating.Now I have tried to return the last one but amazon will only refund my money.  I wish that helped me but it doesn't! I have 2 cameras that I use all the time.  I would be throwing away my second camera investment.Ok, now that I have gone over the bad, what about the good?Screen:  I love the screen, it is nice and large and easy to see.  The only downside is that if you have a nightstand and use the screens kickstand, you will not be able to see the screen while laying next to the bed.Camera:  The cameras work great, I love the pan and tilt, love the image quality and the night vision works just fine for me.  They are compact and hang easily from 1 screw.  I have both hung above the children's cribs with the cords routed out of reach away from the crib. The cord is very long and can reach outlets a good distance away.Camera cycle: This is why we bought this monitor, it can cycle from one camera to the other every 10 seconds.  This makes it VERY easy to monitor our 2 young babies without have to look back and forth.Sound:  Volume is loud but can get distorted at high volumes.Battery life: Great...when it works.Microphone: We actually used this with our toddler and while it is a bit of a novelty, it is fun to talk with him through the camera.Music: Worthless choppy music, we use it only in dire emergencies when we forgot our sound machine.All in all, the product is great, if it didn't break all the time.Now I need to look and see if there are other monitors out that meet the features I need.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Stopped Holding Charge after 5 months", "Author": "Christopher Holcombe", "ReviewID": "R1QW5TIVU40FGF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Really did love this monitor and it's ability to add several cameras since we have a 2 year old and just had twins.

We have two cameras -- one to keep an eye on our baby (now 4 months) and another for our two-year-old's room. The picture and sound quality are both great, and the zoom feature comes in handy when trying to figure out if the baby's eyes are open (so I don't go in while he's sleeping and accidentally wake him early from a nap). My favorite features are the ability to pan the room and the microphone. I can watch my toddler playing by himself in his room -- which is fun in and of itself -- and tell him through the monitor when he's getting into something he's not.

During the night he is just as loud lol...so its great checking the video before getting out of bed to go get him because often he puts himself right back to sleep.

And as all moms of a newborn, I had to make sure every minute that my baby was still breathing, as I was getting paranoid with SIDS. The easiest solution would have been to have baby in our room for the first year or so. But I soon had to go back to work, and since my husband and I had both hectic schedules, we had to make the most of our nights. We decided to be on-call alternatively every night, so that each of us would get at least a few hours of sleep. Since our daughter had a expensive, comfortable crib in her room, we didn't feel back about the decision to make her sleep in her room instead of the small bassinet that was in our room.But how to keep an eye on her was another question. I wanted a visual device, as I could check on her even if she wasn't crying. And since the device was mostly going to be used at nights, night vision was a absolute must.After some research we decided to buy the Motorola MBP36, and never regretted it. I find that the night vision is very satisfactory, and like the fact that we can talk to her or that I can sing her a song from my bed to make her go back to sleep by herself. And even if I always swore to myself not to use this as a spying device, well, I must admit I love to look at my angel sleeping at night, when I am not sleeping myself.Two complaints though:1. I wish that this device had a feature that would allow the user to switch the video off, but still have the video turn back on when baby starts to cry. One reason for that is that when we turned her mobile on, since the music went on for 40 minutes, we generally had to turn the volume down, and sometimes fell asleep before the mobile was off.2. The monitor doesn't get the signal in some places in our house, and that doesn't even depend on the distance: we don't catch the signal from the media room, which is on the same level than our daughter's room, but catch an excellent signal from the master bedroom, which is on the opposite side of the house. Because of that, I tend to wtonder sometimes if baby is sleeping or if the image is just frozen, so I just speak softly through the microphone to make sure that the microphone detects my voice (in that case, the LEDs on the monitor would turn on)But I still feel that it was well worth our money, and we also like the fact that if we were to have another baby, we could check on both children with the same monitor. I don't plan to use it after our baby is beyond the toddler age.

The battery life on the monitor itself dies after about 8 hours, so you do have to charge it at night.  The bad thing with this is that it will not last a full night if off the charger.But my biggest complaints are 1) the temperature of about 4 degrees off, which makes a BIG difference and 2) you can not turn the sound all the way down which you will want to do some times (like when you are trying to sleep train).As a new parent I was terrified of SIDS and they tell you the temp of the room is a key thing to watch- well when the monitor reads 70, it's really 66 in there, which is really cold.  This is one thing that has been driving me crazy, but I guess I have learned to live with it.The second thing is that you can't turn the sound completely off- although there is a \"low\" setting, sometimes you need to be able to see the baby, but you don't HAVE to hear them cry.  I feel horrible to begin with having to sleep train and let my baby cry (which he did tonight for 1 hour and 20 mins) and not being able to turn the sound off only made my experience worse.

We feel strongly that Summer Infant is far better. This one looks more high tech and it does have the option of a camera that moves and intercom feature. However, what it lacks in other features and overall quality makes those features seem like small potatoes. First of all, the video feed is choppy at best. If you wave your hand in front of the monitor you will see it freeze about every two seconds. That's how the video feed is ALWAYS. I don't like that. With the Summer Infant I could literally watch my daughter's chest rise and fall because it was a smooth, real time, continuous video. This is not true of Motorola. Beyond this, the monitor buttons are awful and not designed for use in the dark. On the Summer Infant one, when the screen goes black there is a large button on top of the monitor that you just push and the picture returns. Think snooze button on the alarm clock big -- easy to find and hit in the dark. The Motoroloa button is a tiny button second from the bottom on the right. Yeah -- not helpful at all. Beyond this, the darn thing beeps when the battery is getting low. Obviously Motorola engineers did not consider the fact that for several months or longer many babies sleep in their parents' room and when baby is fussing or making noise it's nice to look at the monitor instead of getting up and going over to stand by the crib, possibly waking the baby with a creaky floor board or rustling around. The beeping wakes the baby! It also beeps randomly for some other reason which I will have to refer to the manual to figure out. It has a green light that flashes next to the on light when this beeping is going on. The screen is super bright too which is bad for having a baby in the room since the light illuminats the room and also shocks your eyes when you first turn it on. Last but not least, it interferes with both our Wifi and our other baby monitor that sits next to it. It's just not a smart design overall. I shoud have heeded other reviews about the lack of thought the engineers put into the design.I wish we had opened this monitor and used it for a few nights before our second daughter arrived.

The pan and tilt controls are clunky being laid out in an un-intuitive vertical pattern and the volume control is buried within a menu.  The two issues are minor, but lend a sense of poor execution on the design table.  The biggest reason I returned this product in exchange for the Samsung was the voice activation feature.  Simply put, the Samsung has it, and the MBP36 doesn't.  After using an audio only monitor for 4 months that had a voice activation feature, it was simply unfathomable why a product that costs over 6 times as much would not have this feature.  That being said, the resolution both in normal light and in \"night\" mode of the MBP36 is VASTLY superior to the Samsung.

I have owned this model for a little over a year.  I like it - the video quality is much better than my previous monitor, the temperature and intercom are nice features, and I like how you can add cameras.  I wish it had a belt clip, a stand that the angle adjusts, and a clock would be really nice for when you're working and you know your babies are nearing the end of their nap time but you don't know exactly what time it is.  That said, no monitor is perfect!  There are a couple things I wanted to point out that I have learned over the last 14 months:1.  If your battery is no longer holding a charge, check to make sure it is still fully connected.  I ordered a new battery and thought it quit holding a charge after a month.  It took a week before we found out it was just the connection!  (I wrote this in my review of the battery)2.  After I owned the monitor for a year we needed another camera.  I thought it would be nice to have the 2nd camera plus a second monitor (one to keep in our bedroom, one in the main living areas), so I ordered this item again.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.  Each camera can only be used with one monitor at a time.  I ended up returning it and ordering the 2nd camera.3.  We left our Summer Infant monitor on almost 24/7 for two years.  Every now and then it would freeze and the monitor needed turned off to \"unstick it.\"  When I leave this monitor on all the time, it tends to loose the signal (and you hear a beeping). The only way to get it back is to restart the monitor (rarely works), and if that fails, restart the camera, which risks waking your baby.  Now, I just make sure the camera is off when it's not needed and that seems to prevent the problem.UPDATE 1:  After owning this for 16 months, the cord to the parent unit frayed.  I called Motorola to find out how I could get a replacement.  Despite the fact that the one year warranty expired, they replaced it for free.  Less than 48 hours after I called, it was on my doorstep!UPDATE 2:  After 18 months, the on/off button on the monitor stuck, and it could no longer be turned on.  After all of our investment in the initial purchase + an extra camera + a battery I called Motorola to see if there was a way to buy just the monitor.  I was hoping I could buy it for the retail price of the whole set less the cost of an additional camera.  They told me they don't sell the monitor screen alone.  I was almost disappointed enough to buy another brand, but the fact that I needed an extra camera stopped me from doing that.  In the end, I ended up buying the whole set again, for the 2nd time.

The parent unit has a button that allows the monitor to play music, and it has another button that allows the parent to talk to the child through the monitor.  The monitor will rotate so far up, down, and side-to-side that you can see baby's entire room.  The temperature gauge is GREAT; we like being able to monitor the temperature in baby's room.The BAD:  The battery charge isn't very good on the parent unit.  Once the parent unit is disconnected from the power source, the fully charged battery only lasts a few hours (even if you keep the video display off with only the noise indicator on), so you basically have to keep the parent unit plugged in all the time.  If you are looking for a monitoring system that you don't have to keep plugged in, this is not it.  Also, while the monitor offers 5 different musical pieces, 3 of them do not seem like \"sleep music;\" they seem too fast-paced and annoying to put a baby asleep or keep a baby asleep.The UGLY:  Ours apparently is now experiencing LCD Lamp Failure.  We've only been using it for 6 months, and after the first month, we have always kept the video display turned off except when we check it periodically (partially to save the battery when it's unplugged from the power outlet).  The screen flashes bright light every second or two - it's like it's possessed.  It's really annoying, and it makes us constantly look at the screen because out of the corner of our eyes, the bright flashes of light mimic movement.  Customer support has been absolutely worthless so far.  I couldn't even find the internet support related to baby monitors (if there is one?), and I'm very computer-search-savvy.  The \"live chat\" on the website only got me the toll-free number for Motorola (so it got me nothing except the info I already had).  The troubleshooting section of the user guide doesn't mention this as a potential problem.  I think it only lists 2 problems, but I can't exactly remember?  I only know it seems to be an LCD Lamp Failure by doing general research (several hours, in fact) of LCD screen problems.  This doesn't seem to be a common problem based on my internet searches (so maybe I'm just the \"lucky one\"), but nevertheless, I would have expected more from customer support.

I use volume control much less than I thought.I use this for about 3 hours at nap time and about 3-4 hours before I head to bed and plug it in to charge.  Close to when I go get in bed it has either died or is beeping because it needs to be charged.  The more you turn on the screen to look at the baby the faster the battery dies.

Is he just having a brief 3 AM squawk, or does he have his leg stuck in the the bars of his crib?With video, I know; but with audio, you can never be certain.  Showing up in a sleeping (or sleepy) baby's room is a big deal, and it should be avoided unless it's absolutely necessary.  But I don't want my poor baby to be suffering in an agonizing, contorted position.This unit is really impressive.  The fact that you can remotely move the camera is just over-the-top.  The image is very clear with good lighting, and still very impressive in complete darkness (though a bit more difficult to discern.)  I frequently find myself staring at the monitor at night trying to comprehend what I'm looking at, but I don't really look at this as being a flaw in the product.  It's amazing that a camera is able to see anything at all in the dark.  The image is not as clear in darkness, since it is now black-and-white and a little grainy, but it is still wondrously useful.The price was definitely off-putting to us, until we received unexpected help paying for it.  We would have bought a cheaper unit had we not received the wind-fall.  But, knowing what I know now, I would pay the full price for this all by myself, if necessary.To put it simply:- The image in full light is great,- The image in complete darkness is not as good, but is astounding nonetheless,- Sound quality is excellent.- The range is amazing.  We can go outside about 50 feet away from the house and still get reception, even though the signal has to pass through 3 walls, one of which is stone.- The range of motion is, I believe, a full 180 degrees horizontally, and a full 90 degrees up.  However, down is about 20 or 30 degrees, so you may have to tilt the camera to get the coverage you want.I anticipate using this camera until my child is probably almost 5 years-old.

We get to SEE AND TALK to our young children, often laughing at the funny things they do in their sleep.Pros:- You can press a button and speak back to the baby/kid in the room for a walkie-talkie type communication- You can press the arrows on the monitor and move the camera left/right/up/down - AWESOME FEATURE - plus the camera's movement in the room is stealth and basically silent so it won't wake a light sleeper- Monitor can \"SCAN\" every 10-12 seconds between different cameras, or it can remain on just 1 camera that you choose- You can zoom in to 2x the actual view- When the room is pitch-black at night, the night-vision is still very good and pretty clear- The monitor has very good range and can be placed on different levels of the house or even outside at a fairly good distance away and still work effectively- The video screen can be turned OFF while still leaving the Audio ON, so it's not too bright in our room at night, but we can still hear the kids- The audio is sensitive so you won't miss any cries or calls, plus the monitor \"lights up\" as the child talks or communicatesCONS:- While SCAN mode is great, if one kid says something while the monitor is SHOWING the OTHER child in \"scan\" mode, you'll miss what that kid says.  However, it flips back and forth every 10-12 seconds so usually our child just calls out again if we don't hear them the first time.  Hasn't been a big issue.  And you can manually flip back and forth between cameras as quickly as you'd like by pressing one of the buttons.The only thing that would make this monitor better is if it had a split video screen and could view both at the same time.  But, like I mentioned before, you can flip manually back and forth as quickly as you want with the tough of a button.

Overall this monitor is SO much better than the SI monitor; and Motorola's customer service was awesome - here are more details, but I highly recommend this monitor and am SO glad to have it back on my nigh stand.Our monitor was always a little 'fussy' when turning it on and off. The button on top of the monitor was finicky, and after about 2 months of use, no matter how hard we pushed the button in, it just wouldn't turn on. So, called Motorola's customer service on a Monday, talked to a real person after a short holding time (<1min), got instructions to send an email with my claim number and a print-screen of my Amazon registry that showed when the item was purchased, and was told I could expect a new monitor in the mail within 2 wks (had to make sure I could return the Summer Infant one we got from BBRU within the 30-day return window). My phone call lasted < 5 minutes - no questions asked either. I called back the following Monday and confirmed my claim had been processed and my new monitor was in the mail. Got the monitor that Friday (so <2 wks from when we called).And we're SO happy to have back the Motorola monitor - even with the inconvenience of having it break after 2 months, the SI monitor was SO bad compared to this one. You can't move the camera around from the monitor; my baby moves all around the crib nowadays, so half the time with the SI one, he'd wake up and be out of the camera shot (we have it mounted pretty close to the crib - the screen on the SI is so small, I don't think you could see any details on your baby (like if he's breathing..) if it was mounted further away). The SI screen also felt like it was less than half the size of the Motorola - technically I don't think that was the case, but the worse clarity and screen resolution made it feel that way.Overall the SI just doesn't compare to this monitor. And from what I read about the SI customer service (one of the reasons we didn't go for that one in the first place), their customer service doesn't compare either. For $40 more, this monitor is SO worth it. Really a night & day difference between the 2.And the new camera monitor's On/Off button on top feels different, so I guess our first one was just a dud from the start.

I registered for it because it looked like a good product and Motorola is a good brand in electronics.  When we got the monitor, it must have been defective because it would \"burn out\" if you turned it off.  You would have to \"reset\" the monitor by unscrewing the back with a screwdriver to unplug the rechargeable battery, wait a few minutes, and then re-attach and then screw the backing shut again.  This was the troubleshooting advice of customer service.  On top of that, the camera would jam and the only way you could pan down was to pan all the way up until it hit the max \"up\" position and then you could pan down.  I have had the monitor for 6 months and we had to unscrew the back so often that we eventually just left the back off and the re-chargeable battery connector just broke up from too much use.  Now we have to buy another monitor.  This was a $300+ monitor that never fully worked from the beginning.  The picture quality during the daytime is excellent and crystal clear. The night vision on the camera is a little grainy.  My brother's Summer Infant monitor's image is much crisper. Also, the microphone works sporadically - in the last few months, it didn't work at all. We receive this as a gift and would have probably demanded a refund if we had purchased it ourselves.

The video is clear and easy to see on the large display. Night vision is incredibly useful in determining if the baby cries are due to temporary discomfort or something needing immediate attention. The pan ability makes it much more useful than a static camera.Two CONs to this product:1) A big con: The battery in the parent's unit (the screen) is underpowered. Unlike audio only monitors, this unit cannot go more than half a day without needing to be recharged or plugged in. I am going to buy another power cord so that I can keep it plugged in when I'm in another room.2) Nit picking con: The zoom is inside the settings menu, so you can't zoom in temporarily without having to push a number of buttons to activate zoom and then deactivate it. The zoom also has only one option: 2x zoom. Zoom isn't incredibly useful.Overall, this product is a great video baby monitor. I would buy it again despite the downsides.EDIT: I contacted Motorola to buy another power cord for the parent monitor, and they told me they do not sell the cords individually. I can either buy a completely new unit for $200+ for the power cord or try and scavenge for a compatible cord somewhere out there.

The zoom function is somewhat useless to me.  I've tried zooming in many times early on to make sure baby was still breathing (paranoid parent!) and it gets so pixelated its hard to make anything out.Nightvision: At night this is actually quite clear and crisp within a reasonable distance, which if used as a baby monitor wont be a problem (i.e. you wont be able to see way down a hall with it, but 10ft is fine).Battery:  its been just over a year, and our battery is showing signs of not holding a charge for too long, and thats with keeping the screen off most of the time and not heavy use.Controls:  pretty intuitive and simple.  The pan and tilt is very responsive and an excellent feature.  The music option is kinda silly and doesnt sound great IMO.  One annoying thing is the volume, in that you cant turn it off.  When we go to sleep, there's a constant humming sound coming from ours like some sort of sleep machine.  It would be great if you could turn off the volume completely, or they upgraded their tech so that it stays off unless there's a reasonable level of sound (i.e. a baby crying).So,  what would I do differently now with some technical proficiency?  There are IP cameras you can buy on Amazon at a fraction of this price, that have much better quality video and night vision, and allow you to view the video from your smartphone, or computer, as well as auto alert you if there's any movement detected.

My daughter was finally transitioning to her crib and as a paranoid first time mother, I wanted a top of the line monitor so that I could watch her breathe.Out of the box, I was thrilled with the video quality. It was everything that I wanted and well worth the significant cost. Many of my friends have monitors that only show their child as a blurry blob on a tiny black and white screen. I could count the hairs on my daughter's head in the dark, sing to her from across the house and hear her tiniest whimper. A couple months in it seemed like the video quality was deteriorating, but I brushed it off, it was still providing a better picture than most other monitors. By four months after purchase the night vision on the camera was completely gone. The camera still works, but at night, when I need it most, it works only as a sound monitor.Once I determined that the camera was malfunctioning, I requested a replacement from Amazon, which they promptly sent. I was hoping that our original was just a dud and plugged in the new monitor, once again marveling at the clarity and sharpness of the picture. At that point I should have sent back the original monitor, but I held on to it which turned out to be a good idea on my part.About three weeks after the arrival of the new monitor I noticed that the top line of the monitor had died. No big deal, I could still see the screen. The pixels continued to died until 1/3 of the screen was dead. This made it difficult to see the information at the top of the screen, but I could still see my daughter, which was what I cared about. Then one afternoon I put my daughter down for a nap, turned the camera on and when I turned the monitor on...nothing happened. We fiddled with the camera, tried the old monitor with the new camera, nothing worked. Our new camera was completely dead. Thankfully we had the old camera and monitor with the dead night vision to fall back on.I'm now searching for a replacement.

Luckily customer service is now improved and the company you call to replace it were great and sent me a new one, a prepaid shipping label and box to send the old one back.  The sound went out on the camera.  It quit moving up and down, only side to side.  And the handheld monitor no longer would hold a charge for long and the buttons kept getting stuck.  I have the new one now and so far so good.  They also changed the ability to tun it all the way down- so you can technically mute it which I like.  Maybe they all did that and it didn't work on my old one, but I don't think so!?  I would still shop other monitors due to how many times mine have gone wrong, but when they do work- they are nice.)At first I loved this monitor then over 2-3 months realized I spent a lot of money on the wrong monitor- here's why:1. I feel confident saying there's a good chance it will break or have something faulty go wrong with it. My first one did and I had to pay the shipping to send it to them and wait for them to receive it them send me a new one. The second one 4 months later now has no sound.2. Speaking of sound, when it does work, there's no way to mute it so you always hear a little bit of noise which doesn't make for a great night sleep considering my baby sleeps to music and/or a sound machine every night which means we now sleep to a sound machine every night. My old Sony monitor had the ability to turn sound off and it would automatically click on when baby started crying. It wouldn't for a quick whimper or anything which was nice bc I slept better not hearing every little noise.2. The other thing that drives me nuts is the tilt of the camera is wrong. It's right as far as making it stable but it doesn't make it easy to see from most angles. I have to pick up the monitor and tilt it just right to see a clear picture. I have messed with contrast and brightness and it doesn't matter. My baby likes to sleep with a blanket so being able to peak at the monitor to make sure all is well is important but I normally have to pick it up to check real good.3.

I wish the product was more consistent. I would not continue to buy this monitor if the customer service department at Buy Buy Baby was not so wonderful. Unfortunately, the customer service department for the actual Motorola baby monitors is AWFUL. If I had bought a cheap monitor I would have expected to get what I paid. However, I bought one of the most expensive monitors on the market. Naively, I expected the monitor to last at least 2-3 years.* I was told by one agent that at least I got a good year out of my monitor.* I was lucky they extended the warranty from 1 year to 14 months. However, they would not replace my new monitor with a new monitor but rather a refurbished one. They said if there were any problems with this unit they would not send me another one.* This is a paraphrase: Essentially they knew their customer service was bad so if I was so unhappy I could go buy a different monitor.Negatives:* The first one I bought the camera at night and even during the day was extremely fuzzy. I simply thought this was something that was normal. This was also the one that broke after a year. Bought a 2nd camera for our new baby and was astounded by the picture difference. The 2nd camera was crystal clear.* Battery life is not great and only continues to get worse as used. I have had this brand new one for less than 6 weeks and it will not hold a charge longer than 2 hours unplugged.I really wish they were better quality.

We were generally very happy with it...but only when the power button works, for obvious reasons.  When \"on\" and functioning, I would give this monitor 4.5 stars (due to lack of a mute option and relatively short battery life). When the unit refuses to turn on, no stars. (The customer service response is also very slow, 2 stars).A faulty button on the parent unit has been our main concern and I was surprised that more people didn't seem to issues with it, since our original AND the replacement both had this issue. It may cross your mind that if I seem to be the only one with this issue, and twice in row, maybe it's me? The power button is indeed small, but the size is not problem (being a mom with petite fingers), it is the design. While the camera unit is a toggle that slides, the parent unit's is a tiny plastic rectangle that is flush with the surrounding surface. At first, the button worked with a gentle press with the finder pad, but it quickly became finicky and I started to have to use the edge of my nail and press so hard it hurt. Even that stopped working so we basically used it tethered to the wall with the cord and never turned it off. But this is, of course, not very practical (as sometimes you may need to travel with it, the power might go out, etc). Ultimately, ours got turned off by accident because we weren't able to get it plugged into the adapter in time. and now we cannot get it powered on despite the well-intentioned tip from customer service to remove the battery pack temporarily. They did send us another one (but we had to go a whole month without the monitor while waiting for the replacement to arrive...super slow service!).  What are the chances that the same thing happened with the new one too? Very frustrating.I called customer service to let them know, and they said that the power button for the parent unit was made to be difficult on purpose to avoid accidental switching on/off. To me, it sounded like an excuse...what kind of company purposefully designs a baby product that sometimes will not work? We were within the 1 year warranty when receiving the replacement for the original, but since the replacement was faulty, I think it's only fair to have this one replaced for a functioning unit, even if we are now past the 1-year period ( due to their extremely slow customer service). It was left that the \"warranty team\" would consider the case and get back in a couple days regarding whether they would replace the faulty unit or not. I will update this review when I hear back....Update 1/10/13: It have now been almost a month since I was told I would be hearing back from the \"warranty team\" after a couple days....this is quite unacceptable customer service. This signals to me that they do not care about having satisfied customers or running a good business.Update 1/25/13: I called customer service to find out what was going on with my claim # and although the reasoning for the extensive delay sounded like an excuse (that they were having system problems last week...well, I had called a 1.5 months ago), the rep was apologetic and helpful. She said my claim had been approved and that I would be contacted by the warranty team with e-mailed instructions on how to proceed.  That e-mail never came but I'm happy to report that I suddenly received a replacement unit a couple days later. ..and hooray, the power button works!

We have bought it right as my daughter was born and had it for seven weeks now. I researched and researched on various video monitors, from ones that work on your cell phone to independent range ones and decided on this one.  I know it is \"high end\" but I wanted my child to be able to sleep away from us from the beginning and this put my wife's mind at ease.  She slept with us for the first night but after that, she was in her own room.  With this monitor, we can pick up the handheld device in the middle of the night in all our sleepiness and clearly see everything we need to at a glance.  The controls are intuitive and do nottake more than a few minutes to learn. It really helped us establish a \"night time routine\".  Even with her having some small stomach issues we still felt very confident in using this monitor to have her stay in her room versus sleeping with us.The PTT (push to talk) is very clear. The screen is very brilliant even in her pitch-black room to where we can see her breathing if she's \"too quiet\" and the battery life is about 8 hours.  I take the monitor with me when I get up on the weekends so my wife can sleep in and it is perfect through our 1500 sq. ft. apartment. Since we are surrounded by wireless, Bluetooth, radio etc. waves I thought there might be some issue with interference but it has been as clear as day (even with the night vision) from the beginning. Also with so many people around, I was glad to have the date encrypted (can never be too safe).  Also the volume monitor is very handy, since everything sounds loud to you when you are new; this helps keep your senses in check (Oh that was just a grunt/other random baby noise, no need to jump out of bed). The lullaby feature is a little gimmicky but the ability to add more cameras and scan between them is a big plus for us since we want more kids.  One feature we did not think we would use but has already come in handy is the temperature monitor.  She was not really sleeping well and we tried feeding (nothing), changing (nothing) and then my wife noticed the temperature in her room was a little higher than normal.  She just needed to cool down and she went to sleep.My only complaint if I had to give one would be the lack of a belt clip.  Other than that being able to pan, zoom, and tilt remotely is great when you want to make sure she's still swaddled, breathing, still sleeping (eyes closed at least) etc.  Hope you have the same experience.

I have used my monitor for less than three months and the battery is pretty much shot. We tried to only plug it in when it was completely empty, and unplug it when it was totally full - but things happen and you need to grab it, or the nanny or a grandparent plugs/unplugs it without understanding they are killing the battery, etc. It used to have a long battery life, but now we are down to a couple of hours, and I see that diminishing further as time goes on. A replacement battery appears to be about $30 online, though I plan to see if I can get one for less.The camera and the way it hangs up - the only option is to have a shelf near the crib, or a nail on the wall above the crib. It would be nice to have had something that could have clamped to a curtain rod or nearby shelf. It is especially a pain if you travel with it and then you are using trash cans and boxes to try and find something to put the camera on near where the baby/child is sleeping.The image on the screen can't rotate - I constantly have to pick up the monitor and turn it on the side. This is not a problem, just annoying.I like the monitor, but I basically feel like you can get an awesome iPod Touch and a wifi camera and do a lot more with the same amount of money, with less hassles about the charger/battery/camera placement, etc. I don't think we would buy this again or recommend it since we are already looking for another monitor that can fill the gaps.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Absolutely love this item!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RXLRY10GPUXT2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased an audio monitor because of the cost of this item, but it didn't pick up anything!

I wish the buttons lit up or had some tactile distinctions--at 4am when my eyes are not focused I cant seem to be able to find the right button to zoom in.2.  It has a pretty wide field of view, but the downward angle is not great.  we have it stuck to the crib post--If baby rolls or is placed right under the camera you cannot angle it downward enough to see him.3.  Screen goes to sleep.  Just FYI, the screen on the handheld portion goes to sleep in about 2 minutes.  you just press a button to re-activate; presumably this is to save battery (see below).  Oddly, it does this even when plugged in.4.  Battery life.  The biggest negative so far is battery life.  I guess I just assumed that the battery would last through the night (especially because the screen goes to \"sleep\" within 2 minutes).  To my surprise, the battery dies after about 5-6 hours.  I guess its OK, b/c I just moved the charger to my bedstand.  For all practical purposes the battery will last for any nap when Im about the house/yard, but this is disappointing nonetheless.5.  Bonus!  The \"walkie talkie\" function has been fun to scare grandparents putting baby down for night who didnt know where my voice was coming from.  Try it.  seriously.In the end, I knocked one star off.  Its still great, but not excellent after 1 month of use_____________________________________I did a great deal of research on these things before buying, and this one stood out.  Now I know why: its a great product with some nice features and good build quality.  Its made by an electronics company, not a baby company like some of the competition...thats the first clue.  It works across our house and out on the deck without interference.  Wireless phones, internet, speakers, and all that dont seem to affect it.  The video monitor picks up very well in even complete darkness.  It does have a great microphone as well and has 2way capabilities if you want to talk to your baby (or spouse in another room).the one downside i found is if you bring the monitor into teh room with the camera/microphone, you get nasty feedback.  But I guess why do you need a camera if you're there?

Then I searched on amazon and got great reviews on this 1. I bought it, but the first one came defected with lines all across the video when I turn it on. I was so dissapointed because my whole family was eager for it to arrive. Motorola was so helpful and I received another one a few days later. The later one worked great. My son has gone from sleeping 40 minutes and waking up (because I have to physically go check on him when I hear his voice which wakes him up) to sleeping for 3 hours straight because I don't have to go check up on him all the time. It's AMAZING!!The only con though is that may be I don't understand how the lullabies work but I thought the music was for the babies while they're sleeping, but the video plays the music which means I only get to hear it, not the baby.

True, you can't turn the volume completely off, but it goes pretty low, and quite frankly if you don't want to hear the baby, just turn it off.  The range is impressive with the antenna up, and I like that it beeps when you're out of range.  The battery won't last the whole night without being plugged in, so thats when we charge it, but lasts for naps during the day as long as you turn it off in between.The only real problem we have with it, is that fairly frequently the monitor goes blank (white) when we turn it on.  This seems to happen most often after its been plugged in for several hours.  When this happens, the sound works but you can't see anything else - no temp & none of the options.  Kinda defeats the purpose of having a fancy video monitor.  Good news is that so far it always resolves, usually after unplugging it for a few minutes before turning it on, thus the reason why we still have it.

After going through what seemed like thousands of reviews of various monitors we chose this one.  I followed the instructions and fully charged it before using it.  We turned it on and it worked fine except for a slight hiccup when I tried to turn the screen on.  I just thought that maybe I hadn't hit the button hard enough.  All in all it was a decent monitor - good sound, good picture, nice features with the temperature display and ability to talk into the room.  We had it on for a while so the screen went into sleep mode.  When I hit the button to look into my daughter's room it wouldn't turn back on.  We tried to turn it off and turn it back on again to reset it.  It turned off and wouldn't turn back on.  We tried troubleshooting (again following the instructions in the manual) by removing the battery but still nothing.I called customer service and it was painful to say the least.  The person who answered had a very thick accent and was not able to understand anything that I said.  I had to spell out EVERYTHING several times - my name, email address, mailing address, etc.  I was highly frustrated since I had a 2 year old circling me and a newborn wanting 100% of my attention.  Once we FINALLY got the information correct she was able to email me instructions on how to return the broken monitor and what to do to receive the new one.  I received the new monitor in a decent amount of time and am waiting on a confirmation that they have received the broken one I sent via UPS (using a pre-paid label they emailed me).The replacement monitor has worked ok so far. We've had it for about a week and a half now.  So far no hiccups.  I'm hoping it was just that we got a bum monitor and not an indication of Motorola's product because our other Summer monitor is now acting up and I think I might have to purchase the additional Motorola camera that goes along with this system.It's a shame these baby monitors aren't made with better quality.

The sound can be turned all the way off or turned up in small increments.  It is VERY sensitive when turned up high, so that could be advantageous if you happen to want to hear every little noise.  The lights along the top indicate how loud the sound actually is in the room so you know what the noise level is even if you have the audio turned off.  The wireless range is excellent, I have three floors at my house and it works everywhere.  I can even take it out into the back yard. Haven't experienced any issues with WiFi interference except to say that if the monitor is very close to a computer or smartphone the audio might blip temporarily if there is a large data transfer (like a webpage loading).  Just move the monitor a few feet away if that happens and the issue disappears.  Overall the monitor does everything I expect it to quite well so I am totally pleased.*UpdateOne minor complaint that I did find about this unit is the volume sensitivity.  The microphone is very sensitive as I mentioned above, so much so that on the lowest volume setting you actually may hear more than you want to.  I had wanted to turn it low enough that I didn't hear stirring or small noises and only heard crying, but on the lowest level I can still hear all the noises baby makes.

On the 7th day, in the middle of the night, the monitor started making a static noise that woke me up.  The noise has gotten progressively louder, and now I have to keep the volume off, as it's crazy loud!  Also, the red lights are lit, but my son's room is completely quiet.  I called Motorola's baby monitor customer service line (888-331-3383).  Unlike the other reviewers on here, I had a very good experience with them.  The service rep told me to try taking the battery out of the monitor, and also firstly turn off all the cameras and then unplug them from the wall.  Wait at least 30 minutes, then put the battery back on/plug in/turn on cameras.  He said that doing this would reset the software.  He said if that didn't clear the issue, to call back and they would send me a replacement, or I could return it to the store, whichever I preferred.  I will update my review after I do this and see if it works.Anyways, here are my CONS about the monitor:I do not like the buttons.#1 - If I want to turn on the screen at night, I have to turn my lamp on to make sure I don't hit the wrong button.  They should have made the button to wake the screen bigger or something, or backlit the buttons.  My solution, if I keep this monitor, is I'm going to put a glob of glue on the screen wake button, so I can feel it in the dark.#2 - I feel like the volume should have physical buttons so you don't have to go into the menu to change the volume.Other than these issues, I do like the monitor.  I didn't really care about the \"bells and whistles\".  My only \"must haves\" for a monitor was 1. video, 2. a pan/tilt camera, and 3. the ability to add a camera later.  However, I find that I really like being able to know the temperature of my son's room, and I find it is very accurate.Regarding the MUTE issue that other people complain about.  I don't understand why this is an issue.  Just turn the volume all the way down if you don't want sound....I purchased this monitor after having the Summer Infant Best View, which died after 13 months.  After reading so many reviews from others who had this happen to them too, I did not want to buy Summer Infant again.  I have decided that if I do need to return this monitor, I will give it one more try and buy a new one.  However, I will purchase from a store that offers an option to purchase an extended warrenty, so I won't be out of luck if it craps out after the 1 year manufacturer's warrenty expires, like what happened with the Summer Infant one.**********UPDATE**************Okay, taking out the battery to do a reset of the software did, in fact, work.  Upon turning the unit back on, there was no more static.  It has worked perfectly all weekend long with no more static noise interference. :)  So, if you are having a problme with static, give this a try.*********Another UPDATE************Okay, the static noise came back with a vengence. Apparently, it was just a coincidence that there was no more static after taking out the battery and re-setting the software. Therefore, I re-purchased another monitor (and bought a 3 year extended warranty this time), but I kept the old monitor until I received the new one, so at least I could use it to have video of my sons room (but no sound because the static noise was so loud I had to keep the volume off).  I linked up the new monitor with the old camera instead of the new camera, since I didn't want to re-mount the camera to the wall.  When I turned on the new monitor, it had static too!  Exactly the same as the old unit.  I figured since both units had the same static issue, the problem must lie with the camera and not the monitor.  I removed the old camera and hooked up the new camera - problem solved.  It has been a week now using the new monitor and new camera, and it has been working well so far.So, if you are having a static noise interference proplem, it is likely a bad camera rather than the actual monitor unit.", "Date": "October 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Customer Service", "Author": "reviewermom", "ReviewID": "R1BPKWUIZET7YL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This baby monitor came promptly, well packaged and worked great right away.Sound quality and picture are excellent.

Then we saw a friends lower end Motorola unit (basically just with a smaller screen) and we wondered how they could see so clearly at night (our's was hazy and we had to leave a light on). So we call up Motoral (customer service only open M-F 8-5) and they shipped us a new one and paid to have the other shipped back. So we got the second one. It worked for 2 months and now it's refusing to turn on. Of course now we are stuck trying to get customer service and you never have problems with these things during the day - you need a baby monitor at night - and Motorola only offers online support for their phones.

They were really great; we put the monitor in his room and one receiver on each floor. The range was really so-so since it loses signal if the baby is sleeping on the second floor and I'm in the basement doing laundry.  We had a few scares with the baby (once with a shortness of breathe and another time where we found him sleep with his blanket covering his face) so I decided to get a video monitor instead (my husband wasn't so convinced and thought I was being paranoid).  I got the Motorola monitor from Buy Buy Baby with the 20% off coupon which includes an extra monitor.  It definitely gave me a peace of mind.  I put the monitor on the nightstand next to me when I sleep and whenever I hear a noise, I just look at the monitor to make sure he's ok and if I needed to get up to fix his blanket or to comfort him.  We keep one camera in the nursery and one in his play area, and it easily lets us switch between the two cameras.  It has a speaker so if I need to talk thru the monitor, I can.  Even though our baby to understand my commands like \"Don't eat that!\", I can use it to watch and tell my husband \"Don't give him that!\". The music feature was a bit too loud for my baby.  I tried turning it on once and ended up keeping him wide awake instead of putting him to sleep.  However I get full signal in the basement wit this.  My mom takes care of my baby while we're at work and she uses the Sony monitor.  She ended up having to walk up and down the stairs to check up on him once in a while.  So the difference between the Sony monitor and the Motorola one, besides having a peace of mind and video vs sound, is that it is 1 Sony monitor (mic) with 2 receivers  vs.  2 Motorola cameras with 1 monitor plus better signal strength.", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very good monitor, but a few issues", "Author": "Mark Z", "ReviewID": "RA535DA5TISXM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We purchased this unit after extensive research, and overall are very happy with it.

As previous reviews have stated, the buttons are small, poorly marked and difficult to press even in good light.  Forget trying to do it in the dark.2.) The two-way voice is so soft that you can't carry on a conversation; the same goes for the music, it is so faint that I don't think the baby can hear it.3.) The Zoom does not have a dedicated button and requires you to navigate an on screen menu to turn or or back off, which makes it difficult to use.Pros:1.)

What a disappointment.  I'm going to have to return it; it simply does not meet our family needs, and here's why:Cons:- Having only one parent monitor is extremely limiting.  So many nights I'll be upstairs in my office and my husband will be downstairs watching TV, or I'll be on the treadmill in the basement, and only one of us is able to hear and see the kids.- The up/down range of motion is somewhat limited.  My old monitor did not have the circular range of motion, but it was very good in terms of up/ down.  Which means, I can keep the monitor up on a shelf or on top of a piece of furniture far away from my 2.5 yr old's curious hands.  This monitor only goes so far up and down, which means, I can't place it too high, or it doesn't show me the full bed or crib.  This is again, very limiting.  In order to see my son's toddler bed, I have to place the camera across the room and at relative waist-level, which means during the day he reaches for it, or sometimes he'll get up at night to see what the green light is all about.  Very frustrating.- The biggest downside to this monitor system is the battery life.  As I mentioned, with only one parent unit, if it goes dead, you're completely without a monitor, and that's what happens EVERY NIGHT!  We charge the battery all day (from 7AM to 9PM), and yet, inevitably, it runs out of juice sometime in the middle of the night when we're sleeping and by morning it's totally dead and turned itself off, so we may as well not have a monitor at all.  What's the point in having a monitor if you can't trust it to stay charged for 8 hours?Pros:  To be fair, there are great qualities to this product, that I should give credit:- The quality of the video is excellent, both the day (in color) and night (infrared/ black and white).  I can clearly see everything in view.- The lateral range of motion with remote capabilities is fantastic.  I can literally see all around the room (almost a complete 360), so even when my son gets out of bed, I can see what he's doing.  I love this feature.- The set-up and use is very easy.  It's intuitive and easy to figure out.All in all, I may have learned to live with only having the one parent unit, but the battery life is not something we can compromise.

We had actually considered some other video monitors and done a few months of research - given we already had an old Summer model and with the addition of a new baby wanted to make sure we made the perfect multi-room monitoring selection.The Motorola MBP36 won out. It beat the Summer and Lorex options; althought the Lorex was a very very close second given its ability to offer simultaneous multi-room monitoring and given that Lorex is actually a security company rather than just another baby-product company. In the end the Motorola is sold in greater volume and with Amazon's 90-day free return promotion there was enough reason to give it a shot and we couldnt be happier!I would recommend this to anyone. Set up is easy - even when pairing additional cameras. My advice, when you pair new cams just make sure you are within 10-15 feet of the new cam because there it does require pressing buttons on each unit to create the push>pull dialogue between the head unit and camera.The intercomm, lullaby, night vision, pan, tilt and zoom features are heads and tails better above the other options. The monitor is chunky enough you can keep a grip on it and yet slim and compact enought to carry around house in your pocket. The images are crystal clear and the audio is even clearer. We have a wireless home network that does not seem to cause interference nor does the networks of our neighbors, nor does the microwave cause interference (which is important to note given the propensity of issue occurence with other manufacturers).The price of the MBP36 is a bit steep compared to others but heck, a Lexus costs more than a Toyota for a reason as well.At the end of the day, you could buy the lesser expensed model and then say to yourself, \"Self, I'd pay another $30-40 to get this right\". If so, just go for the MBP36. Go for it and bundle in the extra camera with Amazon.

We have had no issues and have been using it with single camera and multi camera for two months now. We love it!  It was worth the investment and has some decent features, though we don't use them (music, intercom,)  really.  We love the screen size and that most importantly works well with range too.  We have a 4,000 sq ft home and I have not found a room it doesn't work it and I can even go outside our home.

Here's my opinion about these features. The range is average. The only way you can have the range they claim it has is if you are in a huge building with no walls or your baby is outside with you without any obstructions between the monitor and receiver. I can go on our patio but if I venture out into the yard it loses signal and the video freezes and cuts in and out. THe battery life is average. I keep it charging as much as I can so I always have a charged battery, that's the secret. The video is excellent at night and in the light, this is really the best aspect of the product. As far as the volume,it's average too. I find it hard to hear the baby because the volume isn't loud enough for outdoor noises (we live on a lake and have boats and wave runners passing by) so I am always checking the video.  It's also made out of flimsy plastic and it has no clip to place it on your clothes so you can be hands free. You have to keep moving it around. BUT I use it all the time, even when my son is sleeping in the next room. I can even see him breathing with the zoom feature. Overall it is a decent monitor with some cool features.", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "only 3 small downsides IMO", "Author": "Melissa W", "ReviewID": "R3OUEL4RJEBKHW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What it boiled down to for me, besides the reviews and specs, was that this video monitor was made by a company who specializes in making electronics, unlike other baby monitors out there who are made by baby gadget generating companies who don't specialize in electronics and quite frankly don't know very much about it (especially in comparison to a company like Motorola). That was a key component for me.I'll start with the downsides, since that's what I usually like to cut to the chase to. They're very minimal, but worth knowing.DOWNSIDES:-When plugged into the wall, the video stays on, unless you specifically press a button to put it to sleep (screen goes black, audio stays on), but when unplugged, the screen goes to sleep after a minute or two to conserve battery (audio stays on). I found this extremely annoying, because I constantly wanted to see him, but didn't always want it plugged in, or couldn't always have it plugged in, depending on where I was in the room, and I didn't want to always unplug the cord and drag it around the house with me. I think they should have made it an option you can toggle on and off, knowing you'll drain the battery faster, or at the very least, made the sleep mode time adjustable.-It doesn't mute, just gets very low in volume, which is annoying at times, say if the room you're in is quiet, or you're watching a movie, and you have a white noise machine on in the bedroom with the baby, you can hear that shhhhhhhh sound in the monitor and can't do anything about it. Again, another thing I think they could have made an option. I'm sure they made it that way as a safety precaution, in case you unplug it and the video goes to sleep, you can still hear, but the easy solution is they could have made it so that it can be muted as long as it's plugged in and the video is on, but as soon as it unplugs, the mute option becomes moot (ha).-I wish it displayed the time!!UPSIDESAs far as this monitor goes here's what it does, and well:- Big color screen, which makes it exceptionally easy to see your baby, and switches to infrared (black and white) automatically when the light is low.Infrared night vision has spectacular clarity! (I can actually see my baby's chest moving up and down while he sleeps in the middle of the night in a completely pitch black room).-Camera pans, tilts, and zooms in every direction, pretty close to 300* side to side and 160* up and down (which is amazing for chasing a very rolly-polly baby around the bed and will be even more amazing once they're grown and I'm using this thing for monitoring their play in another room, or while outside, etc if I'm not in there with them).-You can connect up to 4 cameras to one handheld device and toggle between them (again, once your family continues to grow and you have multiple children in different rooms).-It shows the temperature in the room and alerts you if it's too warm.-Obviously it has audio, and you can control the volume and see the noise level with a string of lights displayed at the top of the handheld-Also has a mic on the handheld piece so you can talk to your baby (which I have found especially useful when I'm out back, or on vacation outside.. if I have an unusually long way to get back to the room, I can just press the button and talk to him and tell him I'm coming, which immediately calms him).-...650 ft range (alerts you when you're out of range)-Clearly can be wireless, or can be left plugged in (super long cord, although the wireless battery doesn't last as long as I think it should).-You can mount the camera on the wall, or leave it sitting on a shelf, or bed, or floor, or anywhere you have a few inches (it's a very sturdy little sucker, but not a big base, so you have plenty of options for placement).-Can play a few different lullaby songs through the camera piece in the room with your baby, which you can control from the handheld (I think this is silly, especially since you can't control the volume level, but some people may find it useful).-Handheld has an alarm you can set for 2, 4, or 6 hours, which alerts you if you're one of those moms who needs to wake your baby or feed them on a schedule of your own.-It's pretty, so doesn't look bad sitting on your table (has a leg you can flip out to stand on its own, like a picture frame, and an antenna you can flip up if you need an extra boost if you're getting close to out of range)------------UPDATE (2yrs later):Still love this monitor(!), however, I am about to be on my 3rd one. The first I purchased in Sept 2011 and by July 2012 the screen had gone so dark I could barely see my baby in it anymore, so I sent back for a new one and here we are again May 2013 and it's happened AGAIN-- the screen has gone so dark I can barely see my child. The screen brightness is up all the way as well, so the only time I can actually see much besides a faint outline is if it's daylight. So I'm sending in again for a new one. I'm really hoping this was simply terrible luck and not how the product happens to act, over and over. Anyone else out there experience the same? As a side, the newer model now has the ability to be completely muted by turning the volume all the way down until it's silent. This is a fantastic update, as I now have to use it while I put my toddler to bed in the other room and can still see my infant on the screen while she sleeps, yet can keep it muted in the event she makes noise.------UPDATE (3yrs later):here we are in february 2014 and although i still love the monitor, i've downgraded to 4 stars because unfortunately the cameras can't seem to stay functioning at the capacity it initially arrives at. it starts off excellent, but as you can see above, it eventually goes out. over and over and over. i'm ready for my 4th return/exchange/repurchase of another camera, although it seems these last two have arrived in pretty poor form-- one of my cameras is EXCELLENT. bright, crisp. the other camera (and another one yet that i replaced, but the new one wasn't any better) is TERRIBLE. very dim, even when on the highest contrast, it's hard to see. it's almost like a spotlight flashlight, illuminating just one small area and needing to pan to see other things in the room besides that little spot, vs the other camera, which acts as if a ceiling light is on and lights up the entire room. wish they were better lasting. until now i was lucky enough to still be within amazon's return window, but this time it expired a month ago, so i'm going to attempt to get this issue resolved through motorola directly.", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Almost great", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2WFKBWSVERAAZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good product overall...the microphone is sensitive, the camera gives a clear picture, the range is effective.

Our family uses this video monitor perhaps in a more non-traditional way than maybe it was intended; however, it works beautifully for our purposes and for our family.  Currently, I mostly use the video monitor while I'm cooking or in the kitchen and my young children are playing together in a different room.  The monitor's ability to remotely pan, tilt and zoom from the Parent Unit allows me to view what's happening where they are without constantly having to leave the room to take a glimpse at their activity.  I also like the option to have 1-way or 2-way communication with my children.  This option gives me the freedom to call to them, halt a behavior, or simply welcome them to dinner.Generally, the wireless video monitor was easy to set-up so I initially put to it to use in various locations around our home including low-light environments and areas pushing the 590 feet range.  All views were clear and the quality of the image is good.  The infrared night vision provided enough light to do what the monitor advertised and intended.

We've never had a video monitor before (we just had a basic Sony monitor for our first son) so this has opened up a whole new world to us! Our 2-yr old takes awhile to fall asleep for nap and bedtime so it is extremely helpful to have the video capability to check on what he's doing (standing, sitting up, lying down) before deciding whether we need to go in.

I would hear sounds with the audio baby monitor and go all the way to their room to find them just rustling in their bed... I got worried that I would not check out a sound and it would be serious.  So I tried several video monitors... this was the only one that could detect the camera in their room.I now have one in their bedroom and their bathroom.  It is wonderful - for me the pan and tilt is worth the extra money in the bigger screen model.  I love the ability to talk to them - I pretend I am Buzz Lightyear's Star Command.  And when they start to do something that I want them to stop before I can reach their room (stuff tons of TP in the toilet, squirt toothpaste at each other, etc)  I talk to them over the monitor as I am going to the room.  They immediately stop what they are doing and jump in their beds...2 drawbacks:1 -the price - ouch - but I could not find another camera that would detect the camera in their room - not sure if it is the distance or the soundproofing in the walls...2 -not being able to mute the sound entirely as stated in other reviews.  But the benefits far outweigh that.... It also does not do split screen, so when they split up into separate rooms,I will need to get a second parent unit... more $, but maybe I won't need it by then and I can use this as a security camera for our back lanai.

However, now that we have moved her into a bed and she gets up and out of the bed this is very useful to be able to scan the room and see what she is up to! I also think it will be great to use with an infant because you can zoom in and see them up close. I recomend this to all of my friends who are pregnant, so much better than the summer infant! One con is the battery life isn't great on mine, but I called Motorola and they said it is fine to leave it plugged in when not in use, when I do that the battery is fine.

It is nice to see the led's on the screen, range from green, to red, when our baby is really crying loud. It's just nice to have the ability to quickly turn on the screen, check on the baby, instead of physically getting up, and walking in the baby's room, potentially waking him up.The range is also very good. Our baby can be sleeping in an upstairs room, all the way down the hall, and we can be 2 floors down, on the opposite end of the house, and still have signal. Also, the mic feature works well. If I go get the baby upstairs, my wife can talk to me on the mic, if she wants me to bring anything down from the baby's room. As far as signal quality goes; we have wifi constantly running, with 3 computers, and a smart phone, and their is no distortion or cross talk between any of the electronic devices and monitor.The kickstand behind the monitor is great for propping up the monitor on an end table, while you do your thing around the house. Another nice addition, is the ability to add other monitors to the set up. We will be doing this shortly. We love this monitor and screen so much, that we convinced 3 other people in our family to purchase the set up.Pros: Pretty much all the features listedCons: Price  Temp is off by a few degrees.

I'm out during the day and I don't want my wife (who works from home) to open the door to a stranger.  Sure, we got the peephole - but the person knows you're behind it and what if.  Install was super easy, everything worked without any additional setup needs.But ... I did need to read the manual. Why you ask - I couldn't find the ON switch for the LCD end.  The ON/OFF button is way too small.  My fat fingers makes it difficult to operate and I have to concentrate each time.  I only wish the switch had been made a bit bigger.Other than that one 'small' complaint, we've been using it for about a month so far - and it work flawlessly.Edit: After around five months of use the Night Time Capabilities stopped working.  The loss of an additional star really isn't because of this failure - all electronics fail/I completely understand.  The loss of an additional star is due to the return systems in place.  Apparently Motorola has outsourced this function to a third party, and it is a case of (through no fault of this third party company) slow returns and a process that isn't well thought out.  Since its a third party company, they really can't change the system.It would have been nice if I could have given a card number and they immediately shipped a working unit back to me - so I wasn't without a defective unit, while the broken unit got sent back.

There are a couple of cons but it's the best one I've seen.Pros:- GREAT picture, both during the day and at night.  To me, that's the whole point of having a video monitor and Motorola nailed it with this one.- Lights on top of the monitor that provide a visual representation of sound.  This is nice if I'm doing something (vacuuming, etc.) where I can't hear the volume or if I just want to keep it turned down.  It also means I can let the screen turn off and still know if my baby starts making noise.- Camera is small and easy to mount.- Panning and tilting is great and almost silent- The two-way communication feature is nice.  Seemed pointless at first but there's been several times when one of us was putting the baby to bed and needed to ask the other one a question.  We can do it quickly and without getting little guy all worked up because \"Oooo, there's Mommy!!!\"- Temperature feature is nice.Cons:- No mute button.  Sometimes my little guy fusses before he goes to sleep; it would be nice to be able to mute the monitor.  I can usually hear him anyway and don't really need it in stereo.  (That's why I like the video monitor - I can watch to see if he's really upset or just \"complaining\".)- Battery life isn't great.  However, I keep the charger next to the bed and plug it in every night before we go to sleep.  As long as it's fully charged it'll last an evening of doing things around the house.- Would be nice if it had a belt clip and/or a way to lock the buttons.  It's easy to hit a button carrying it around and accidentally move the camera.- Not really a con because we don't use them, but the lullabyes are anything but relaxing.  Kinda creepy, actually.- I'd like a second parent unit.

I think I read someone else's review about this but I agree.  It probably costs 50 cents to add a clock to this monitor.  I don't know why Motorola didn't think it was a good idea.  I didn't think it was a big deal at first, but once I started to use it, I realized it could be very annoying to have to look at the monitor then a clock (at 4:00 a.m. and without glasses).- No mute button.  Even when I have the volume at the lowest setting, it is still loud, loud enough to keep me up.- The monitor power on/off button is soooooo tiny.

This Motorola camera is the perfect solution to what I have been looking for - good quality picture with pan/tilt functionality. We had been using just an audial monitor, and I ended up getting up and running across the house everytime I heard my baby cry, turn, cough, sniffle, or anything else that sounded \"off\". With this monitor, I could simply stay in bed and watch my baby to make sure everything was OK.PHYSICAL CAMERA:This has an on/off switch and an ac adapter. Note that this camera MUST be plugged in to work - there is no battery-operated option. This isn't a huge deal as the camera can pan/tilt everywhere and is wall mountable, but it can be a minor nuisance if you want to temporarily move the camera to different room(s).VIDEO QUALITY:The video works very well in both light and dark conditions. In low light conditions, the picture quality becomes a little bit gritty, but the entire image is still quite clear/visible. In normal/bright conditions, picture quality is excellent.AUDIO QUALITY:The volume level is adjustable on the monitor... we have the monitor placed across the room from where my child sleeps (~10 feet). When I turn up the volume to max, I can hear everything, including my child's breathing. The only downside to this is that you end up hearing all of the white noise as well (hum of air conditioner). It doesn't bother me, but in our quiet bedroom, the white noise coming through on the monitor is quite loud.HANDHELD MONITOR:You control pan/tilt, volume, screen brightness, and music from here. You can also see the room temperature, and can talk through the unit to be heard from the camera on the other side. The unit has a battery and ac adapter, and when not plugged in, the unit will automatically go into sleep mode (screen will turn off). You can still hear what the camera is picking up, but you will have to press the display button in order to see the picture again. if the unit remains plugged in, the screen stays on unless you press the display button to turn it off. There is also an option to connect additional cameras through the system, and then you can cycle through the cameras from this single monitor. I only have one camera, so I can't speak to how well this works.I have not seen anything else on the market that comes close to the quality/functionality of this unit.

It needs a good bit of light to pick up color very well, but that's not a priority for me.- Great range and reception - We live in a 3000 sq ft, 2 level home and the nursery is the furthest room from our family room, where we spend most of our time. We've never had even a minor issue with reception. Additionally, we have a wireless router, wireless printers, cell phones, and other mobile devices (iPad, Nook, etc) and there's never been any interference between any of them and the monitor.- Crystal clear sound - I can hear it clearly every time he sighs or rolls over, even on the lower volume settings. Additionally, the lights along the top of the monitor that show sound are very responsive. You can talk to the baby using the monitor and it also sounds surprisingly clear.

Unfortunately, you cannot \"mute\" them while you're watching to see if they go down.2.  Add a belt clip to the parent monitor!These two easy convenience items would make this a 5+ star item.

I wanted something reliable and this got good reviews.  Unfortunately this monitor is not going to work for us. There is no way to turn the audio completely off/down. When my daughter wakes up, if she is screaming I like to turn the audio off and just have the video so I can see what she's doing without having to hear her through the monitor (since she screams loud enough to hear her down the street anyway!)  Unfortunately the lowest volume setting still allows for some pretty loud noise if she is crying.The pan and zoom options are nice if you have more than one kid in the room, but since our monitor is wall mounted over the crib, I found that I don't use them.  I would also say that the picture quality on my summer unit (which is not digital) is far better especially in night vision than this unit which is twice as expensive! The only other complaint I have is that when the unit is off, but plugged in to charge there is a blue light that stays on, which casts a fair amount of glow in my dark bedroom when I'm trying to sleep.  That being said, you could always just stick a piece of electrical tape over it.To be fair there are a lot of pros.  The large screen size for viewing is nice.  There are a lot of options like room temperature, a lullaby, the ability to talk to your baby.

The clearest and cleanest picture I have seen on any baby monitor--night vision is exceptionally clear.  All those reviewers who complained about having to push the one menu button to get into the volume settings are complaining just to complain--you literally push the \"menu\" button in the top right corner of the monitor and then the \"up\" or \"down\" buttons on the top left side of the monitor. If you know how to touch type you can definitely find your way around this monitor in the dark. It's as easy as pie.Another complaint about this monitor was there being no option to turn the volume off completely. This does NOT bother me because if I'm lying in bed asleep I'd like to hear my my baby if he needs me. Add to that, the lowest volume setting is very quiet.- I also like that you can turn the screen on and off using one of the main buttons (don't need to go into menu to do this).- I love the panning feature! We have the camera mounted on the wall and can pan to see everything in the room and the motor is very quiet.- Intercom option is nice. If I or my husband were in the room with the baby and the other is in another room we could talk to each other without having to yell or run across the house to communicate with one another. Our son is only 4 days old but this option will come in handy to talk to him when he is older.I already ordered another camera to install in our 3-year-old's room!Do not hesitate to buy.

You end up carrying these things around a lot and the talk button placement means you may end up accidentally activating the intercom function if you stuff it in your pocket.  It would also be nice to have a longer battery life.  Fully charged, we get about 8 to 10 hours out of ours.Note on the competition: We have purchased two versions of the Summer Infant monitors. The first one we returned less than a month after purchase because we couldn't resolve the interference from other products in our home.  On the advice of a friend, we went to Target and bought a much cheaper version that still had the pan/zoom feature.  That one was wonderful, until it stopped charging.

After returning my last video monitor I was worried that there wasn't a video monitor in existence which would meet my needs/expectations. My last monitor was great excluding one major deal breaker: it would lose signal constantly and only had a visual not auditory indicator that the signal had dropped.I did hours of research and read numerous reviews on other monitors before purchasing this one. I am so happy with its performance. The signal strength is GREAT, it can go places in my house that were completely off-limits to my other video monitor. Even in the rare situation that this monitor loses signal it will give me a visual and auditory indication. So if I were to be sleeping at night and the monitor loses signal (power failure, etc) I would be awakened by a beeping noise.This monitor has tons of great features and completely meets and even exceeds my expectations. I was looking for a good, basic reliable video monitor with the ability of expanding to two cameras in the future. With this camera I got more features than I bargained for and now I can't live without them. The pan/tilt function is great for locating my toddler in her room if she gets out of her bed at nap time (she can be very quiet and sneaky). I also like the 'intercom' feature, I tell her to get into bed and she does it immediately. She actually minds me better over then intercom than if I actually went into her room!! Her bedroom is upstairs where it gets pretty hot in the summer, I love being able to see the temperature at all times so I know when its too hot without constantly running up and down the stairs.I would buy this monitor again and again.

I really like the kickstand feature on the monitor.3. The motion on the camera is completely silent and the range of movement is fantastic.4. Range is incredible. Our bedroom is on the opposite side of the house from the nursery and we still have full signal.5. The resolution is pretty good--compared to iPhone 4, not so great.  But for the purpose it serves, its fine.6. Two-way communication is very easy and convenient--not too tinny on the camera side (wouldn't scare the baby)7. Our thermometer seems to be accurate, I know others have said it was off.Some improvements could be:1. A way to mute all sound from the speaker.  You can only turn it down low.  We're learning to deal with it.2. A VOX feature where the unit sleeps to preserve battery until movement or sound are detected.3. A clock would be nice.4. The feature where you can hook it to your TV is great.  However, Motorola doesn't provide you with the cable.Otherwise, this really is the best camera I found through my research.

Motorola doesn't sell replacement handheld units, they only swap units covered by warranty.  They do however sell replacement cameras.

I call that \"ALL TALK, NO ACTION!\"  I did receive a call from another person at Motorola, however every time I call and leave a voicemail, I get a return call the following Friday at 2:45pm PST (5:45 Eastern time - where they are located), saying he'll be leaving the office in 15 minutes and will return Monday.

On June 6, I sent our defective monitor back to Motorola, including the cover letter requested, paid for tracking (as requested), sent the follow-up email (as requested) and NOTHING.  After approximately 15 phone calls, 10 emails, and everything short of threats, I received word today that the unit will be shipped.  I demanded overnight shipping, which took another 30 minutes of holding on the phone for that to be authorized, and am still without a baby monitor OR any form of an apology.  During this two month-long debacle, I have dealth with a variety of Motorola representatives who were either rude, lied, or simply non-responsive.  This includes the supervisor, Charlene, who I have left several voicemails for asking for a return phone call to discuss the total lack of customer service we received, and I have yet to get a response from her.  Needless to say, we are BEYOND ANGRY and disappointed and will NEVER EVER EVER purchase another Motorola product.

The screen size is excellent, the picture quality superb, and I find the menu to be easy to navigate even in the dark at 4AM.  The only problem is the camera (aka the baby unit) just stopped working out of nowhere after only a couple of uses!  I tried to \"pair\" it, which the users manual suggests if your parent unit loses connectivity with the baby unit, but it failed to pair.  I called Motorola and, unlike other reviewers here, had fantastic customer service.

My only complaint (and this is minor) is that it doesn't have any indicator when the battery is fully charged.  I says in the manual that it can take up to 15 hours to fully charge, which is a really long time, however you'll never know when it's fully charged because it doesn't tell you.

This is a HUGE plus!  Our old monitor claimed not to cause any interference but whenever we used it we had awful problems connecting to our router over wifi.-Great range.  I am able to go 3 houses down before it cuts out.  We've never had a problem with connection in and around our 2 story home.Cons:-I wish you could turn the volume down lower or off.  We tend to keep our volume at the lowest level and still hear him just fine.  Especially since it has sound activated lights.-Unless the room is well lit the camera is in night mode.  This isn't a big problem, I am still able to see him fine but the color video seems to be a little clearer.-Although the low battery and out of range alerts are a nice feature the loud beeps every 6 seconds gets annoying very fast.-Amazon's description claims that it \"has a camera functionality to take digital pictures when needed\".  I don't see that option mentioned anywhere in the manual or in the device's menu.  Not a big con just noting the discrepancy.Update:  8 months since purchase and the battery life is greatly diminished.

Of all of the monitors that we reviewed it came the closest to having all the features we were after.

Fortunately for us our daughter has very strong lungs and we can usually hear her regardless of the monitor volume.  So we primarily use this monitor for its video features.I was VERY impressed by the video quality at both day and night.  Very crisp and detailed.  However, after a few months of use I noticed that the night vision started to degrade, I used to be able to easily see across the entire room easily and with great detail.  But now I strain to get a detailed picture of objects at night that are more than about 2-3 feet away.At first I thought it was my mind playing tricks on me, but then I read other reviews and multiple users are complaining of the same issue.  I also have a second camera and compared the night vision camera on that one to the original one that came with the unit.  It became VERY obvious once I did that, my second camera easily lights up the entire room with its IR lights and I can see across the room with no problem at night.  However, the first unit looks as if most of its IR lights have burned out, and its only able to illuminate a couple feet of space.BOTTOM LINE: If you bought one of the first units off their line, they had a few quality issues, and you should check to see if your night vision has degraded over time.

I did my research as a paranoid first time mom and decided on the Angelcare Platinum monitor (AC1100) which combines the breathing mat monitor, sound, and video all in one.  I thought this was the ultimate monitor and the reviews I read all reinforced this.  First off I didn't use the breathing/movement pad that goes under the mattress bc my little one refuses to sleep in her crib, also if the baby does not stay on the mat..the alarm will sound as well..I just used this for the video and sound.  I thought it was pretty good until the unit crapped out on my 2 weeks into use..the video image went blank!!  I returned it and started searching again.Now that I found the motorola...WHOA..it makes the Angelcare look like a cheap toy! The video image on the M is amazing! I can see my child breathing, the Angelcare in comparison is grainy and not nearly as clear.  baby looked like a ghostly image now that I think about it.  the range is 2X better and the sound is so clear I can her her sucking on her pacifier..the camera unit is very sturdy as well.

Their mediocre at best, level of customer service is horrid! This monitor is great, I've had it for 18 months with very little defect, but, my 3 and 4 year old decided it was a fun toy and now it has somehow disappeared. Knowing I would need to pay some to replace the parent unit, but hoping not to buy a whole new set, I contacted Motorola and their answer was a big fat, NO, you have to buy a new one! Seriously? I have spent over $350 including the monitor and additional cameras and I just have to buy a new one? That is horrible, Motorola, if you are going to venture into the world of products for babies you might want to try your hand at being flexible and accommodating. I will never give Motorola another dime of my money or recommend their products to anyone.My original review: I recently bought and returned a Summer Infant Monitor, I was not impressed with the quality of the night vision and it was just an unreliable option.I then went looking for another option and had almost decided on the newest Summer Infant. Then my husband got involved in the research and insisted we go with a Motorola, since they know cameras. I was worried because I wanted a unit that was easy for moms and best for babies.Well, I just got it in, set up the camera by myself in less than five minutes and all my worries have been put to rest! This unit is amazing! The pan and zoom are great and do not make a sound. We keep my son's room completely dark with blackout curtains so the night vision is really important to me. It by far surpasses the night vision of the Summer infant. I can read the writing on his stuffed Buzz Lightyear doll laying next to him in bed!I haven't seen the option to take pictures as the description says, but this is not an important feature for me so it doesn't change my review. I love the parent unit, easy to use, great \"kick stand\" in the back which can be folded down to easily carry around. The unit does have an antenna but I don't have it up and am getting great video quality, no choppiness or fuzziness!Overall Motorola outdid themselves with this unit!

The on/off button on the monitor has not been working right.  It is like there is a loose wire.  Now it does not work at all!!!  The on/off switch has always been sensitive and I had to hold the button in just so for it to turn on & off.  Sometimes it would not turn off easily and I'd have to do that several times.  So maybe it was not right from the beginning?  Well the machine does not turn on/off.  If you read the original review, I had to return my original unit because it did not work.  So this is the 2nd monitor to stop working.  I can't return it to Amazon anymore and if you read my original review, you will see that the Motorola customer service is not the best.  While it has lasted about 18 months, I'm very disappointed that it doen't work anymore.  This monitor was not cheap and I expect it to still be working.Original Review: The monitor started out working okay.  But never really as clear as everyone says.  Then after about a month, both my husband and I noticed the image was grainier. After reading some reviews, I found that this has happened to others.  So I called Motorola.  Lady was nice.  She was quick to say it was defective and didn't do any troubleshooting nor did she ask any questions.  She said they'd send me a new one and then I'd have to send the old one back.  Asked if I had to pay shipping & she said no.  Sounds great, right?  Then I get an email from they stating that I have to return the defective item first and then they will send me a new one.  This means I will be out of a monitor for a few days/weeks.  Ummm, if it is defective and they have acknowledged that this is a problem with the monitors, then I should not have to pay anything for any shipping. They should be apologizing to me for selling me a product that does not work right. They also say that \"the shipment of your baby monitor for repair/replacement will be at your own risk.\"Other issue: the volume is too loud on the lowest setting and there is no mute button. Hopefully, the volume control is also a defect that will be better on the replacement.I will update my review if the new monitor is better.UPDATE 1/30/13 - gave it 2 stars instead of 1I did speak to someone at Motorolla again, as the VP suggested (see his comment), right after I did my original review.  The secretary just sent me over to someone else and acted like it was strange that I called her. She didn't seem to know what I was talking about and acted like I accidentally got the wrong number.  So they guy I spoke to was ok, not really apologetic and even told me it was better to return it through Amazon. So I just ended up doing it through Amazon.  Calling them was pretty much a waste of my time.The new monitor is still working and pictures are mostly clear (not as nice as described, though).  There are still some issues.  We had to get a second camera for the new baby and sometimes the volume will not work at all.  Scary, if you are not aware of the problem and something were to happen to the baby in the middle of the night.  It's also a pain if you get the baby down and then you get downstairs and are starting to relax, thinking they are asleep.  Then you notice that the volume hasn't been working!  If this happens to you, just unplug the camera and plug it back in.  This happens to both of our cameras.  It seems to happen anytime I touch the cord or move the device, like when cleaning or if I accidentally touch it. This did not happen when we only used one camera.  Also, if you look at one of the rooms and adjust the volume or the brightness, you cannot switch to the second room.  To remedy this, you have to turn of the screen, then turn it back on and then you can switch screens.  It's annoying.  Just wanted to let others know in case you have the same problem.  I will also post these comments in the camera section.Volume is still an issue.  Way too loud on lowest setting!!  Motorola has to fix this and there needs to be a mute button.  Sometimes I just need to see what's going on or if I'm walking upstairs I dont want the volume on where my kids could hear themselves (and sound like their in stereo!).Battery life is so-so.

Our home is very vertically oriented, and we often stay in the basement watching movies/relaxing while the baby is in the 3rd floor. The unit performs under these conditions rather effortlessly. I have not yet figured out how to connect it to the TV; I am told that is possible, and I cannot wait to figure that out.Now for the ergonomics. One of the most common ways we use this unit is to monitor our child when we are sleeping--I have this unit connected to the wall socket/power in our bedroom, and reaching/feeling about this device from a weird angle while half asleep and feeling about the device is just not possible. I like to shut off the screen until I hear a noise from our child (who sleeps in the same room, but not visible from our bed), and then power the screen -- this does work, and there is a button there to turn off/on the screen, but it is impossible to locate it in the dark. And--the power button is indescribably poorly placed, and its position is not very easy to guess feeling the unit. Oh, the rubber pads have dropped off in the bottom, so the unit slides about easily on our bedside table.My wife and I have been surprised by the generally abysmal quality of items that are baby-related--I expected significantly higher quality from Motorola, but my expectation was clearly not warranted. We have been let down more than once in the quality of products made specifically for babies/parents. I chalk this one to the same problem.

This is why we bought the video monitor so we could make sure she wasn't in any trouble, ensure she was only crying to be held.
