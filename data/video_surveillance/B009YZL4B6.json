{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome indoor PI camera", "Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "R15G4LP9SFS7GZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Am an ex-cop and have been a PI for 15 years. This is the best camera I have ever used for \"not so covert\" recording. It takes a little practice to get familiar but once you do, you can stand 30 feet from your subject in a store and hold it as if you are texting but you are actually looking at the screen to assure your subject is centered. And as you know, no one is suspicious of someone just standing around texting in their own little world. The screen is directional so even if they walk by you, they can't see what you see unless they are looking straight down at it. My clients are amazed and have no clue how I get away with not being detected and get perfect footage. My only complaint if the only output is high def. I had to get an analog converter for the input of my DVD recorder.", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009YZL4B6"}}
