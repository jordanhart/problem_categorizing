{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Only docking a star for camera quality - easy to setup/use/monitor", "Author": "Candace Strickler", "ReviewID": "R3QE8M5TZTTRXL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using this system now for over 6 months. It has never crashed, and has actually saved me in a legal matter. A major delivery company delivered 3 laptops to my home, leaving them on my porch - except they really only delivered 2! Caught on tape! BAM, no problem getting that claim paid extremely quickly.The set up of the dvr is not entirely intuitive. It does include a helpful CD/DVD installation media; which includes a full manual, and software for most every platform for controlling and viewing the cameras. The best resource is the company's website. They have a very robust website, with video links to every imaginable question answered and demonstrated on film.You could just stick up the cameras, plug them in, and everything would work. No doubt, most will want to delve in a bit to customize some of the settings.I will break this into 2 sections. The DVR itself including software, and the cameras.The DVR:It is black in color, light weight, and housed in a metal case. The are multiple ports on the back for up to 16 bnc connectors, Video out: vga (dsub) and BNC (includes adapter BNC to RCA plug), usb mouse, ethernet, pan tilt and zoom, and DC power supply input.You should know that if you are putting this near your entertainment stack, there is an annoying red light that will incessantly blink when motion is detected and the unit is recording. You can obviously fix this with a bit of tape.The interface is a bit quirky, but you can figure it out fairly quickly. Mostly, left click selects, and right click takes you back. Somehow the network autoconfigure, automatically opened all of the necessary ports on my Verizon FIOS router. I am capable of accomplishing this task, but it was nice not to have to worry about it. The main port that need to be opened is 9000 (media) and port 80 (web) on your network. You will also need your IP address. (this is the ip for your router, not your computer) visit ipchicken . com to find it quickly.!!!!!<<<<< note >>>>> !!!!!I do not recall seeing it anywhere in the manual - but you MUST set a user name AND password for any of the network stuff to work.You will need to adjust the color for your cameras. None of my cameras had good color by default. I was able to achieve pretty good results by fooling around with the color options in the  camera control submenu.Other than setting the motion areas (accomplished by clicking and dragging) - and color - recording time slots, if you choose that -- there is not much else use for the dvr's menus. Most everything else you will do through the web interface.I did not use the DNS web address that is offered. I used the nightowl dvr software (NETVIEWER) that is available from the website or off of the cd. It is very robust, and allows for a multitude of options. From the nightowl dvr software menu you can designate cameras to send you digital snaps when motion is detected (you need a gmail address). To use NETVIEWER you need to have port 9000 open on your router. Then input your ip address (ip chicken - remember) the user name (you pick) and password (no restrictions here).From netviewer you can play back captured footage. Simply select a date, and a channel (camera), you will then be presented with a time-stamped list of all the recordings for that date. As you play back these files, they are automatically saved to your computer. The default path is under \"Local Settings\". Once these files have been downloaded, you can really easily convert them to standard *.avi file using the converter that is on the included dvd (or download from website). it takes mere seconds and I used it to give to the police, and the delivery company.There are Pan/Tilt/Zoom features available in the Netviewer console as well, however - none of the included cameras have this feature.You can also playback LIVE video only, using an iPad or iPhone. The Nightowl app is available in the app store. It is a drag that you can only view live video, but their support team has assured me that you will have that ability in an upcoming release.One GREAT use for this is checking to see if your amazon delivery has been left on your porch yet or not!Overall the DVR does exactly what it claims. I have a 500gb drive, and I still don't think I have begun to overwrite yet (another feature you can set from the DVR interface). The playback is clear, and reliable. The motion capture record works very well. You can have it capture june bugs flying around, up to squirrels, or only catch the delivery driver stealing your laptops.THE CAMERAS:They are a step up from total crap. They do not fogup, so far none have failed, and if they do get a little rain on them, it tends to roll off quickly. I did treat mine with rain-x so they work even better now, but it was never a problem before through rain, sleet, AND snow.You get 8 with the STA186. They are all the same. A hooded full metal body, and painted metal base. The cameras are connected to the dvr via the included BNC+DC combo cables that are included. I think they are all 60ft long. I needed 2 cables of 100ft, which I found here on amazon for a very reasonable price. The power is provided by 2 included DC power supplies (some people call them transformers). Each power supply powers 4 cameras (there is a sort of Hydra connector that turns the single plug into 4). Be sure to note the 'sex' of your cables before you run them. It matters which way the power plug goes! I was in some pretty inhospitable spots with my install and would never want to have to go back. I used a 5/8\" speed bore for my cable runs to get through. This is a fairly tight squeeze that requires you to first push through the BNC connector, then power connector. A little expanding foam or caulk will fix the hole.The camera mount is secured by 3 screws. The included screws are total crap - you will likely want to use your own. You will want to the have the cameras removed from the base while mounting the bases. The camera is easily removed from the base by unscrewing the set screw that allows the camera to rotate around a recessed collar. The further adjustment of the camera is accomplished by a ball-socket connection that can be secured using the finger adjustment nuts.A helpful hint I used was to have the iPad on the ladder with me as I adjusted the cameras.One issue with the cameras is the night-vision feature sometimes creates some distortion in medium-low light. When the camera is getting confused as to whether to run in night mode or full color. Speaking of Night mode - they shine here. The night vision feature is excellent, and in some ways more clear than the full color.My overall impression is very good on the system as a whole. The biggest complaint is the camera quality. The DVR interface is a little less than intuitive - but the NetViewer software is excellent. iOS APP works great on the iPhone and the iPad.", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Super happy with this purchase", "Author": "C Graham", "ReviewID": "RWZ5YKDLOMT0F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned  camera systems in the past, and recently purchased this Night Owl system and am pleasantly surprised by the level of customer support I have received from them. I was able to reach their 24/7 tech support via phone after I got home from work.  2 things of note, 1st, its awesome that they are open any time as I hate calling from work as this unit is for home, and 2nd, the support wasn't overseas with someone reading from a training manual (Cassandra was very nice and professional).The cameras are solid and are simple to install, others I\u2019ve used in the past are cheap plastic.  They include a simple 1 page quick start guide that will get you from start to finish, and also watched the how-to videos on the Night Owl website [...] which were very helpful.Ended up calling support and she configured my network settings and got me hooked up on the internet in less than 10 minutes and now I can view all my cameras using my iPhone. The app they told me to download was \u201cNight Owl Lite\u201d\u2026best part about it is it\u2019s FREE.This is a lot of system and service for such a great price.

I had already bought two other systems and returned them both because they were complicated and not very \"user friendly\".I decided to keep this one because it advertises LIFETIME customer support.  Finally I made a good decision.  This system works great.  I have zero networking experience but the excellent customer service people not only explained what to do but logged on to my PC and set everything up for me in a matter of minutes.They even made a hand typed note explaining how to do some basics and placed it on my desktop so I could not lose it.  Seriously, who does that?  This is customer service at its finest.I made a mistake and pointed one of my cameras towards the front yard where it picked up every car driving down the highway which resulted in hundreds of emails a day.  I called customer service again and was up and running perfect in under 5 minutes.The cameras and DVR function exactly as described.  I only have DSL basic and was concerned the quality might not be very good.  This was not a problem.  Video is not choppy and the clarity if fine.I am waiting for this to go back on a lightning deal so I can buy a second one for my primary residence.I highly recommend this product.I hope you found my review helpful.", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent System for Price Minor Security Problem", "Author": "theguardianii", "ReviewID": "R51KAK4TJYMIP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this system mainly because of its price and the decent reviews across the web of the company. It is not a high end system but it will do for regular home surveillance.  I tested the product out of the box and everything I tested worked fine.  The cameras came on and the DVR was functional.  (did not test the system over the internet)  The IR is not the best outdoors but you get better IR inside the home due to the reflection of the IR light off the surfaces in the home.  The Cameras will do well for facial recognition within 10-20 feet this would be the typical range in which you'd expect to find that in this price range.I gave this system 3 stars due to its ability to be tampered with and the fact the images of the cameras lead you astray.  I live in a ranch style home meaning I'm in a single story and I cannot place my cameras up high enough that they could not be tampered with easily.  The wires attached to the Camera for both power and video feed are exposed to the elements which leaves them highly susceptible to vandalism.  Other systems have a \"vandal-proof\"  design where it goes through the post and is covered.The camera system should be enough of a deterrent but some criminals consider it a challenge and will look for blind spots or vulnerabilities.  I'd rather not welcome the challenge and make it easy.Other than the mentioned security risk this system is a sound investment especially for internal building surveillance as well higher than one story mounting outdoors.  I'd recommend this purchase for people in those two situations that are looking for a cheap system for security surveillance.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great starter unit - side effect includes Camera Acquisition Syndrome!", "Author": "Hollis Kelvin Lee \"The Pseudo Chef\"", "ReviewID": "R3EWBL6TJ6YQKN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this DVR back in December 2012 after months of research. I know its not the best product and perhaps not even the best in its class but it does the job well (with a little help as I'll explain later).After I missed out on all the thanksgiving sales when the newer model was $249, I was extremely pleased when I found this model as a warehouse deal. The item arrived in excellent condition.Getting the system connected was quite simple as the quick setup posters provides the exact steps required to get the unit up and running.The O/S of the dvr manages the 500Gb rather efficiently as I can get 35-40 days of video on all channels with motion activated recording.The port forwarding feature is a bit challenging for me but once you have a static external IP you should have no issues. So for now I have the system connected to my local network and so I can view from any smart device tablet laptop desktop etc. This means that I can monitor from any room in the house with dedicated viewing on three devices all wireless. No more wondering who is at the front door or what was that sound outside. Until I have the port forwarding configured I am using the email feature to provide 'near real time' snapshots of alarms while I am away from the house.The video quality is best on CIF for me as the higher resolution produce choppy videos. The view angle is also quite restricted at 42 degrees making camera placement critical. Although I have the entire property covered there were a couple blind spots. To address this I purchased a couple 600 TVL cameras with 90 degree viewing angles and I can say on those channels video and picture quality have improved tremendously and at that angle there is perfect overlap of the viewing ranges i.e. no blind spots.So if you just want a simple unit to get started in home security this is a great place to start. But note it is inevitable you would develop Camera Acquisition Syndrome as coined by an earlier reviewer.", "Date": "February 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sensitivity", "Author": "David P. Manasas", "ReviewID": "RPLE4YVIZHZQ3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Almost USELESS. Imagine you come home each day and review the security camera video captured during the day. You are looking for anything that triggered movement. Regretably, it takes forever with this unit. EVEN ON MINIMUM sensitivity, the cameras record almost continuously and you can only go forward 16x speed. So, reviewing the days activity takes....all evening. Yes, you can 'mask' areas to keep the motion sensed to a minimum, but those are the areas YOU WANT to trigger the cameras! I find that when I do this, someone would have to jump up and down in front of a camera to make it sense motion! I have another brand unit and it is far superior, only recording when someone enters the cameras range. Without masking. So it takes 5-10 minutes to see what happened. Also it seems like this product was designed and developed in a non-English country. The instructions and on-screen menus are not easy to follow.

This isn't really a deal-breaker, but it's important to note in case you ever find yourself trying to describe what an intruder is wearing to the cops. The cameras and DVR are relatively easy to connect to each other using the illustrated setup guide.You'll need a few things in order to be able to use this system to it's full potential.  First, you'll need high-speed internet (DSL at the very least), and access to your router or modem's settings/admin. Its necessary to set up port forwarding. I had to call my ISP to get my router's login info. This system connects to the internet via ethernet cable. Because my router is in a different room than the DVR, I spent an extra $50 for a Netgear N300 wi-fi to ethernet adapter, instead of running 100ft. of cat5 cable under carpet and through walls. It works great for this purpose, and I'd recommend it. You'll also need to know your ISP's email settings. Another thing they don't mention - if it's necessary for you to update the DVR's firmware, the only way to do it is by using a USB flash drive.  Not a big deal, but its one more expense if you don't already own a flash drive (I couldn't find any of mine and had to buy another).Now for the bad parts. The software in this system really falls short. Even though the company has numerous videos on their website, it seems as though the videos only cover the things that are clearly covered in the included manuals. I had to call their tech support twice to get the system working to the point that it is now.  I am able to view my camera feeds through my smartphone (which is why I initially purchased), but I still haven't been able to figure out how to view my camera feeds through a web browser.  I consider myself to be a pretty technical-minded person, and while the hardware setup was simple, the information missing from the manuals, as well as error messages written in \"Engrish\", made for a more frustrating experience.For the price, I probably shouldn't complain. The cameras seem to be very good quality-wise, and if I can ever get the software set up properly, it should be a solid platform. If you're a techy kinda person, I might say give these a try. If you're not, the company does offer a third-party installation service (can't vouch for them, but they do offer it).", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Warning DO NOT BUY", "Author": "Pete", "ReviewID": "R15EODCPA1L5I5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this garbage in Aug 2012, installed it in Sept 2012, and the DVR stopped recording in Nov 2012.

C. Heismann \"kristof65\"", "ReviewID": "R3MYDUMYDSJ945", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I installed my DVR, and 2 out of the 4 cameras over the Labor day weekend.  The biggest pain about the install for me was crawling in my attic to run the cables - I actually had to recruit my 10 year old to crawl into some cramped places for me.  I've had those two cameras running for about 4 days now, and am getting familiar with the system. I plan to mount the other two cameras this next weekend.In a nutshell, for the price, this appears to be a pretty decent system based on my experience.  I'm happy with it so far. But then, that's because I had a pretty good idea of what to expect - and what not to expect - for the money I was spending on it.A little background - from 2002 to 2005, I worked for a company that sold professional surveillance camera systems that cost from $3k on up to tens of thousands. While I didn't work with/on the camera's directly, I got to spend quite a bit of time playing with them.  So I didn't expect much from a sub $300 system, even though it's 8 years later. However, this little system easily matches and exceeds the \"low end\" systems my company was selling back then. So I'm getting more than I expected - which, so far, makes me happy with it.General comments- These cameras do suffer from the Woods Effect, in terms of color of vegetation. But that's ok with me, I'm more interested in what they see moving around, than in the color they render them in. Any system in this price range is likely going to have the same drawback. The $3k systems 8 years ago had this issue, too. Color balance indoors while I was testing was much, much better.- I have a couple motion activated lights around my house, and I was concerned about how the lights kicking on/off would affect the transition between day/night modes on the camera.  Now, my camera's aren't pointed right at the light, so I've been happy - there is a noticeable transition, but it doesn't affect what I can see.  However, the light kicking on/off does trip the motion capture of the DVR on it's default of 4. I just tried lowering it to 3 to see how that affects things.- night vision is good, quite usable out to about 15-20ft or so. They say 30', and I think technically it does extend out that far, but between where my current cameras are mounted, what I expect out of them, and their resolution, the 30' isn't something that matters to me. If you truly need good resolution of a night vision camera out to 30', look for a more expensive system/camera that will range out to 40-60'- Camera resolution is not going to grab the license plate number off a car pulling into my driveway, but at least I can tell types of cars apart. Again, I didn't expect them to be any better than they are.- Setting up the port forwarding was pretty simple for me. But then, I do that for industrial equipment as part of my job.  Setting up port forwarding is as much art as it is science - there are simply so many manufacturers and providers of modems and routers out there that it's going to be hard for any company to give explicit 100% accurate instructions.  In this case, Night Owl provides more than enough documentation that even the most novice network person should be able to contact their Cable/DSL modem provider or router manufacturer for help. Why not recommend Night Owl for help with that?  Because it's not a function of their equipment, it's a function of the router or modem - which is not a part of this system.- I ran into two issues while setting up the mobile applications on my phone and tablet, one minor, one very frustrating but ultimately simple to solve.  For android phones/tablets at least, Night Owl provides two different apps - Lite and Pro. Each app is aimed at a different series of their DVRs. Make sure you're using the one for your DVR.  Second issue is after you get the mobile setup done in the DVR, it appears you must reboot it before they'll actually take effect.  I spent a good hour trying all sorts of various things when finally my common troubleshooting sense kicked in and I thought \"Before I contact their service, I haven't rebooted it, I wonder if that will do it?\".  Lo and behold, it did.- a couple of days after I had it running on my laptop and my phone/tablet, I went to install the Netviewer program on the CD ROM on my desktop in my home office.  Unfortunately, the CD-ROM drive on my desktop decided to take a crap on me, and I couldn't load it from the CD-ROM.  \"No worries,\" I thought, \"I'll just go grab the program from their website.\"  That proved to be a mistake - one, I couldn't download just the one program I wanted, I had to download an entire zip file of stuff. Two, it wasn't exactly clear that zip file actually had the program I wanted in it.  And finally, three, it turns out that the version of Netviewer on their website was not the same as the one on the CD-ROM, which took me a couple of hours to sort out.  I was finally able to install it by transferring the install program from another laptop I installed it on to a USB drive, and installed it on my desktop from there.- I made sure to install the DVR in a place where it shouldn't over heat and will get some decent airflow. From my years of experience as a technician, and specifically from my years working for the company who sold camera systems, DVRs are prone to heat related failures. The less expensive a system is, the less it will have in terms of cooling. Make sure you factor that into your installation.- I made sure to measure out where my cameras were going to go, and ordered a 75' and a 100' cable extra. Turns out I probably could have done without the 100 - your situation will vary - but if you think you may need them, I highly recommend picking the cables up and having them on hand before you start your install - especially if you have to crawl through a hot, dark attic full of insulation like I did.- I was hoping to be able to handle all of the settings of the DVR from the Netviewer interface, because my monitor is my TV, and it sits a good 20' and two rooms away from where the DVR is located. That's not the case - some settings require the mouse driven menu on the DVR itself. I've ordered a 32' Active USB cable to see if I can use the mouse that way. If not, I'll have to drag up one of my PC monitors from the basement to plug in to the DVR temporarily.UPDATE: the 32' active USB extension cable works just fine. However, it turns out that there is very little in the direct interface that can't be done with the netviewer program.- someone else mentioned, and I'll second it - try and mount the cameras out of reach if you can. The video/power cables are exposed, which leaves them vulnerable to someone with a pair of wire snips.  I have a one story ranch, so I have several cameras where this is going to be an issue. However, by the time I'm done getting these four cameras up, and the next four cameras after that, I should have mine covered in such a way that at least one camera will catch something if someone tries to start snipping things.- I have not set up the email feature, and I probably won't. I know from past experience that the lower end systems tend to flood your inbox with useless emails because they're too sensitive, or not send any at all because they're not sensitive enough. I _might_ set it up should I go on vacation and turn it off when I get back.- at this point, I haven't had to contact Night Owl for any help, so I can't comment on their service. I did email them to tell them about my issue with the website and the Netviewer program. I haven't heard back from them on that, but then my email was worded in such a way that it was obvious I was contacting them for their benefit, not mine, and as such, didn't really expect a reply.Obviously, I can't report on it's long term durability right now, as I've only had it in for four days, but at this point, I'm happy, and I foresee no major issues.If you're thinking about a camera system, this one seems pretty good - but make sure it matches your expectations. If you need or want true color outdoor, high resolution, high security, extended night vision range, etc, be prepared to spend a lot more than this. If you're just looking for something to deter the neighborhood kids from cutting through your yard, and monitoring the UPS/FedEx drivers dropping off your packages, it will work just fine for you.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "great little system", "Author": "SingleAct", "ReviewID": "R31PJUMHVBYHVA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This system does just as advertised!

This is a result of the infrared spectrum being picked up by the cameras, even when well-lit. The infrared bouncing off the chlorophyll in the natural plants, grass, and trees, will show up either white or silver/grey or pink/purple on the DVR. You may also see black-colored clothing show up discolored, possibly purple. The Wood's effect is normal for lower-end infrared cameras as despite well-lit conditions, the IR never completely turns off. You can read more about the Wood's effect here: [...]\".  Here's a further CS response \"The Wood effect is not discussed in any of our advertising literature. Any camera which uses the same sensor for visible light as infrared light will be affected by the Wood effect. You're welcome to switch vendors, but I will advise you that any infrared camera which uses the same sensor for day vision mode as for night vision mode will have the same issue. Did you read up on this at that website we linked you to?  As far as refunds go, as per our warranty, we do not offer refunds.\"Other than not getting color (or true colors), picture clarity is okay and the overall value for a simple system is better than Samsung's black and white system.

Tougher to tie in to the network", "Author": "Krayzie77", "ReviewID": "R2NR8L2CUTC2ZB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this a while back when it was on Amazon's Lightning deals.  It really was a great deal.  4 cameras, 500GB HDD, network to the internet, notification email and the best part of all was that there were no monthly fees.  No brainer right?  Especially since I just moved into my first townhouse.  The area I moved into is a quiet area but the town to the next of us isn't so friendly so I figured this would give me at least a deterrent from being a victim.  Got the cameras in classic quick amazon fashion and put the box in one of the rooms and mentally added it to my \"honey do\" list.Well, things got put off and a month goes by with me thinking that I'll just do it the next week.  Until I get home from work one day and find that someone broke into my house.  One of the hardest lessons I had to learn and just the feeling that someone went though my house was enough for me to take the next few days off of work and secure my house.  Ironically, they didn't take the security camera system.My girlfriend and I installed the cameras with little to no problems.  With the help of an extension ladder and drill, we hardwired it in 4 hours.  We live in a two story townhouse and my thinking was to mount the cameras high, near the roof soffits.  Then wire it through a drilled out hole to the attic.  Finally having all the camera wires drop down into the 2nd floor master bedroom.  After everything was hooked up, we fired up the tv and we had the four camera screens online.  After a few tweaks to the position of each camera, we were satisfied.Networking to the router to let outside computers/phones access the cameras was a headache.  Their instruction sheet looked very simple.  I guess the part I got caught up on was the port forwarding.  Now I know how to port forward but I forgot that I had other things port forwarded on those ports they suggested using (a nas storage device for one).  After a few days figuring that out and trying to understand their workaround to dynamic ip address I was able to view in anywhere on my iphone.  The lag/refresh rate using my phone on a 3g connection is pretty impressive.  The resolution was \"okay\".  To this date, i'm still haven't got the motion email messaging alert to work correctly.  I'm guessing this is due to me using a hotmail email server as opposed to an isp ran email server.  Again, I just need to find the time and keep working at itHardware quality:The main unit is very simple.  No hdmi out so I had to use rca composite.  Remote leave alot to be desired but I just use a wireless logitech mouse instead.  It makes things a lot easier.  When I purchased, I was thinking that the wires wouldn't be long enough but surprisingly they were a lot longer than needed.  Loved that the cameras were metal and had some weight to them.  Hung them under the roof ledge so I don't know how water resistant they are.  I didn't like that the cord from the camera didn't go through the mounts.  That was the reason why i choose to mount them so high (roof level on a 2 story townhouse).  Was worried someone could just cut the wire.  Again, resolution isn't the best.  which is to be expected at this price point.  The night vision is really around 30ft.  Im a little worried on how clear faces would show up in a real burglary.  However they do make better cameras that you can purchase (ie ones with 90ft night vision). Camera's use a two wire hookup to main receiver (BNC connector and small 12volt power).  Motion sensitivity and area are adjustable.  HDD size is amazing and at this low resolution I can record more than a week nonstop .Overall I'm satisfied with this product at this price point (<$200).  Again, it's mainly a deterrent.

Hooking up the cameras was a breeze. Running the wires thru the eaves into attic in my 85 old house not so easy. Just as a suggestion use different screws than were supplied to mount the cameras. The heads strip very easily.  After getting the cameras all installed I ran into a snag on setting up the router. I called customer service and after a 10 minute wait got a really helpful tech on line. He took over my computer and after 15 minutes had everything up and running on the computer, Android tablet and phone. Now I can sit here at home in Florida and watch the waves and storms as they happen at the other house. The cameras are just so so. I tried adjusting the color but gave up. For what I need they work fine. I can see gulls and ducks 2-300 feet away flying by or paddling up the bay. I think I will find one new camera that has a wider field of vision and possibly panning ability for the one I mounted at the top of the gable end looking out at the water/beach and yard.  Another feature I really like is the ability to change DVR settings with my computer remotely  800 miles away using the program that came on the enclosed CD. Those pesky waves on the bay were turning on the motion detector to much so with the programs ability to block areas of motion my DVR isnt recording nearly as much.

This is not a high end security system, but accomplishes the goal if you don't want to pay monthly fees to a security company to store the video on their servers.The DVR works well, and is pretty intuitive, and it's easy to search for videos and save them to a flash drive.  The motion detection setting actually starts the recording about 10 seconds before the motion is detected, so you can see what happened a few moments before the person or car approaches.Some other commenters have mentioned this problem: During the daytime, the color is awful.  Green things (trees, grass) turn blue or purple.  At night, when it turns to black and white, obviously this problem doesn't exist.The screws for installing the cameras are flimsy.  Go the hardware store and get some sturdier #6 wood screws (3/4 inch or 1 inch length works well) if you're mounting the cameras in wood.  Each camera requires 3 screws.All in all, it accomplishes the goal I wanted, which is to serve as a deterrent, and allows me to see people and cars as they walk or drive by.  However, if you really need a higher definition camera system, then you should either purchase a different system or purchase better cameras, which you will obviously pay a lot more for; or pay a monthly fee to a higher end service from ADT or other security company.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Night Owl Security STA-84", "Author": "YhwhKhai", "ReviewID": "R2SD4IXRQJLKFK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can honestly say purchasing this Night Owl security system has been a great experience thus far.I opened the box and tested all of the cameras and they all worked just fine.

After feeling frustrated and not understanding why I kept having port issues, I called Night Owl customer service and explained the problem to them. I only waited about 10 minutes for an agent to come to the phone. Once I explained the problem, they sent me a file for me to download in order for them to be able to view the problem on my laptop.

The infrared sensitive camera & lights don't work well during the day.Mounting cameras under the eaves of your house or in shade or on real cloudy days will trigger the infrared during the daytime hours...  Giving your daytime video inaccurate colors (e.g. plants are pink/aqua, dark clothes look grey, etc.)If you want accurate day time color for security and identifying trespassers, you've got to mount these cameras in open sun light.The direct sun on the camera and IR sensor will turn off the infrared.I tried disconnecting the infrared led lights (easy to do by removing the front cap and taking off 2 small screws).It helped a little.Separate from the infrared led lights, the camera also has a light sensor.So, with the infrared lights off,  in low light (like shade or real cloudy days) the video is b/w.On bright sunny days or if I mount the camera in the open,  the color is true.However,  disconnecting the IR lights, gives me limited night vision range and I can only see what is lit from existing lights (porch & driveway).  Which is actually pretty good for monitoring close to the house.Night Owl support says that the higher end cameras with 600TVL will not have this daytime infrared problem.

It cannot be adjusted to correct it, so I turned the saturation down to zero.  Now it records in black and white, which is fine for my needs.  I've read alot of night vision security cams suffer from this.I have not connected my system to the internet, nor do I plan on it, so I can't offer any feedback here.Everything worked out of the box and was super easy to hook up.  The hardest part is running cam wires.The night vision does work very well.  I have 3 of my cams up so far and they do their job in pitch darkness.

The ONLY minor issue was after I told him the name of the app I was trying to get working and he never once mentioned that Night Owl has their OWN APP.
