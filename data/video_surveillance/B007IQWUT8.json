They even come with the audio/video cables attached to the camera.What I did was drill a hole in the mounting plate where it gets screwed to the house, cut the connectors off the ends and ran the wire through the hole. Make sure you tie a couple of knots on the wire so if someone tries to pull the wire out and tug on it, it wont and they will think that it is actually a wire being used to power the camera and record. Then you can tuck the wires behind the mounting plate, screw it to the house and your done.I will probably buy more as amazon was sold out. Couple these with a few camera signs and motion lights and you should have some added security to your property.In my honest opinion, unless you are monitering cameras 24/7, and can alert authorities if there is a break in, cameras are useless. The burglar can be in and out by the time your camera sends you a motion alert, you receive it, alert the cops and they arrive. A good 15-20 minutes can pass in that whole process. Now you got robbed and all you have is a photo of the burgler and now the cops have to count on him robbing the neighborhood again, catch him and be able to identify him.", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera", "Author": "Meg", "ReviewID": "R17WRX88R4GZC1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this camera for outside our office.

They were exactly what I was looking for and I put them up in several places. The only complaint I have is that when I tightened one of the screws that hold the base swivel, it broke off. So not really high quality screws, I was able to put another screw in and it worked fine.

The actual case is made out of strong, durable metal housing.  I believe that these could be the actual cameras without the real \"guts\".  Highly recommend these as these look more realistic than the other, cheaply, looking plastic ones.  Real cameras don't have the \"blinking\" lights.  Easy to install, however, my only comment is that the mounting screws seem a bit long for the application.", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "just as advertised", "Author": "jim blick", "ReviewID": "R3S866R6F13OFE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "better than most than I've  seen advertised.

Not a flimsy plastic contraption.Pros:* REAL metal camera body (minus the electronic guts).* Looks just like the real (working) SWAN cameras.* Real cable, so you can 'wire it up' realistically if desired.* Came with several Swan 'security' stickers, IF you want to place on your windows/doors.* NO blinking LED lights (REAL cameras don't do that; blinking red almost always means 'fake' to a crook!)* Easy to adjust to point to any angle.Cons:* Screws were cheap quality and the heads nearly stripped when screwing them in. You may need to substitute your own higher quality screws.I recommend mixing 'fake' cams like these among real ones, if possible. Don't depend entirely on fake cameras. The crooks won't know which are live and which are not. The use of the window stickers is up to you; Swan makes many actual security systems, so the stickers might be a good deterrent.-1 star for cheap screws.
