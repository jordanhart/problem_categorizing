{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Doesn't see IR, but good camera for regular light, & 3x zoom works great", "Author": "Radio Relay", "ReviewID": "RMGN4P50TVE2Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well, the camera arrived on time, and I installed it. This is my fourth HooToo ptz camera, but the first one of this style with the enclosure, that I've purchased. It configured easily. Took about an hour to get it set up and tested for the features I use, and about 30 minutes to mount.There was a quality control problem, which was somewhat easily solved. Although, it's a \"gotcha\" and would most likely drive a less experienced person crazy (I'll go over that further down in this review). The physical installation went well, but again, there is one small design flaw that was annoying, and which added maybe ten minutes to the process. However, over all, it was pretty easy and painless.The camera was shipped and delivered on time. Out of the box, it was in good shape, and all components were there. I was pleased to see a 6dbi antenna, instead of the usual 3dbi that come with these low-end cameras. I did not have to do any readjustments or tweaks to the optics. Picture is Chrystal clear, and the 4x mechanical zoom is sweet. The ptz movement is nice and smooth, too.Initial configuration of the camera is exactly like all the other cameras in this class (Hootoo, and other brands). Connect it directly to the router, via ethernet, find it's ip, connect and play with it to make sure everything works, and then set the admin password, ssid, wireless security configuration, etc. Then, disconnect the ethernet and test for wireless connectivity. This all went fast and easy.I then took it out to the location and mounted it. It is a nice compact unit, but it is difficult to get a screwdriver to the screws. I had to remove the camera and housing from the base so that I could get a screwdriver to the mounting screws. Then, once the base is screwed down, remount the camera. Not real difficult, but I managed to lose two of the teeny tiny screws that hold the camera to the base. and now have to find a couple more that fit. Not a huge problem, but annoying!The primary \"gotcha\" was the fact that the MAC address listed on the camera housing was not the actual MAC address of the camera! I found that out when I was trying to reserve an ip address , and set port forwarding for the camera (to view remotely, via DDNS). I had copied the MAC down from the one listed on the camera housing, but that was not the same address that the camera reported to the router. The MAC that the router sees is the \"real\" MAC address. The one listed as \"Device ID\" in the \"Device Status\" window (in the on-board management software) is also correct. The one on the case was 100% different (i.e. not a typo, or incremented by one, etc). This is sloppy quality control on the part of HooToo, and will probably prevent many people who buy their product from being able to set up DDNS!The software cd that came with this camera is not too good either. I installed it just to see what it was, but intend to uninstall it. I don't think it would be real helpful in setting up the camera, and probably will add some confusion for the novice, or someone who has not dealt with these cameras before. Also, the little manual that comes with it is good for comedy relief, but not much else.And finally, the camera does not see infrared. At night it will only see areas lit with normal light ... So, if you have a well lit area, then go for it.This camera will work well for anybody that does not have a need for night vision. The 4x mechanical zoom is awesome. For those installing it, remember to verify the MAC via the router and/or with the management software in the camera. Also, the CD and manual that comes with it are pretty much useless, but this is no different than any other security camera in this class (including the more expansive Foscam). I did give 4 stars due to the lack of IR, but all other features of the camera are very good.========================================NOTE: My original review of this camera was pretty harsh, because of the lack of night vision. I have changed my review, due to the extremely good customer service of Sunvalleytek. It has been amazing! They immediately went to work setting things right. Paid for the return of this camera, and sent me a replacement camera, which does have night vision.Sunvalleytek provides good quality products, and superb customer service. I am now very satisfied with this Amazon purchase from Sunvalleytek.", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Descent, wish the video didn't have the grain", "Author": "M.

I wish some other people would post a video or snapshots of their camera so I could have compared it against others.  I am not sure if my camera is defective or if all of them are like this.Unboxing was easy.  You must unscrew the dome, counter-clockwise, to get the foam out of the dome.  It was EXTREMELY difficult to unscrew the dome.  I wish I would have read that on here.  Putting it back on was easier as I took a dot of dish soap and put it on my finger and went around the threads on the dome and was careful not to cross thread it when I put it back on.  Just be aware that the dome may be VERY difficult to get off.The software that came on the CD was not useful to me.  I used the Ethernet cable and plugged it into my router so it would get an IP address.  I went into the router and determined what the IP address was under DHCP client list.  It was easy to identify as the hostname appeared as ipcam or something like that.  I then hit the IP address with my browser (Chrome), logged in as admin and a blank password, and set the network settings.  I set my camera to have a static IP, otherwise I'd be playing guess the IP every time my router reboots.  Then I went into the wireless settings, clicked scan, clicked scan again, selected my wireless network, set the security settings (look on your wireless router security settings for the correct encryption settings), put in the wireless password (I really hope you have one), saved the settings, put some user accounts on it, and unplugged the Ethernet cable.  I then tested it to make sure it worked on the wireless.  I then mounted it to a wall, outside.You will need to drill a 7/8\" hole, possibly 1\", to stick the cables through.  I was a bit disappointed there wasn't a harness you could disconnect so you could drill a smaller hole.  I didn't end up drilling a hole and ran the cable up under my eve since I mounted it on a shed building.  The camera pans all the way around no problem.  You can adjust the left and right endpoints of the horizontal pan by using the two small screws at the top where the top of the dome connects to the mount.  I mounted mine to the corner of my shed to get even a better viewing angle.  I did this by bending the mounting bracket ears to about 45 degrees instead of the 90 degrees they were originally at.  I did that using a vice, vice grips, and then finally mounted one ear of the bracket and then held the camera securely with one hand while tapping the other ear with a hammer to get it flat against the wall.  Holding the camera made sure it didn't get the vibration from tapping on the mount with the hammer.  Mounting was quick, it only took me less than half an hour.  Once it is mounted, get power to it and you're good to go.One thing I am disappointed in is the vertical pan.  It can't pan up past the dome.  So essentially I can't get a picture up hill.  That is aggravating for me since my camera is mounted at the bottom of a hill where my horses are.  It would have been great at the top of the hill!  I figure most of them have this limitation, but I thought I would point it out.  Technically if the camera were lower in the dome and then allowed to pan upwards more, it would be possible to make a PTZ that could pan up higher, so maybe the expensive ones do.  Horizontally you couldn't ask for more.  Unless you mounted it to slim pole or hung it by a string, the camera's blindspot is simply your wall, which you don't need to see.  The zoom is ok, the optical 3x is better than nothing.The web interface is easy to use.  If you want to use IE to use the ActiveX component, which allows you to record video (that is what I used for the video), then you'll need to go into IE, add it to your local intranet zone or trusted sites zone, and configure the local intranet zone (or trusted sites zone) to prompt for installing and running activex by untrusted publishers.  For goodness sake don't do this for your Internet zone for security reasons.  Personally I use Chrome or Firefox most of the day so I don't care for the ActiveX component.I was able to easily poke a hole through my router.  The camera only works on port 80 so it is disappointing that your credentials are being transmitted over the net in plain text.  Hence, use a password you don't care to lose.  I used my router settings to put it on a different port on the outside of my router since I don't like running things on port 80.Personally I use IP Cam Viewer (by Robert Chou) for Android to view it remotely.  All the PTZ functions work with it.  I found an article on the Zoneminder forums about getting the HooToo cams to work with Zoneminder, although I couldn't get it to work in 90 seconds so I gave up for the moment.I will be curious how well the mount and dome stand up over a couple years outside.  They seem painted good so let's hope for the best.  The dome has a rubber seal so I don't expect it to get condensation in it.My primary purpose was to add to several other bullet cameras I currently use on two other systems.  I wanted to be able to pan around and watch my horses in the pasture while being able to track anything else I wanted.  I should also mention I am on satellite Internet since we can't get DSL or cable in the boonies.  It seems to work fine, although because of the satellite latency the PTZ is not as quick as if you are sitting at your computer at home.  However, it's good enough for me.  I'll use the bullets to identify someone if God forbid I had to, and this HooToo to be able to give me peace of mind watching my horses in the pasture.UPDATE:  I did contact HooToo support who offered to refund my money for the camera.  I am in the process of obtaining a new CMOS sensor board (the part that captures the image) to see if I can get a better picture from the camera.  If so, I will post an updated video and would definitely give the product a higher rating.", "Date": "June 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice outdoor pan tilt zoom camera with night vision", "Author": "HelloKitty", "ReviewID": "RK0KJ2IQKC1DU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The setup for this camera is nearly identical to the other brands on here, and if you run into any problems there's a wealth of info on the forums.

It arrived in good condition and installation was tricky but acceptable for someone with computer/network experience.  The IP Camera Tool software that comes with the camera is useful for obtaining the IP address.  It is necessary to have DHCP enabled on your router for the tool to locate the ip address.  The IPCamClient software that came with the camera is good and allows up to 64 cameras to be attached, and port forwarding to view the camera remotely.  There are only 9 preset positions, but otherwise it works well.  I found an updated software version on the web that worked better than the version on the disk, which seemed to have some glitches.  The picture quality is quite good when there is adequate lighting.  Daytime viewing is in color which is accurate, but night time switches to b/w.  The IR led lights around the housing cast a limited amount of light in total darkness, but seem to help when there are some lights on.  The zoom is a useful feature but could be higher power.  Auto focus, white balance, and iris function are good. PTZ control is good wired but a little jumpy when used wireless.  Once you have your presets set it works well.  I have tried this camera in two locations.  The first was outside mounted on a yard light pole.  Daytime viewing was good, but nighttime was not bright enough.  The second location is in a 40X80 calving barn.  With several lights left on this camera is working well, but in total darkness you will only see shadows up to about 20 ft.  I purchased a Loftek camera after this one because it looked identical and was cheaper, but the picture quality has not been as good.

The Amazon price for each the first two types of IP cams was $70. This more expensive version combines outdoor protection with the pan-tilt capabilities to the first camera, adds zoom, and maintains night vision. Its current Amazon price is $250.Out of the well-packed box, the camera appears to be solid and of a much higher quality than the other HooToo cameras I've already installed. Much more of the camera is metal and the form factor is pleasing. Another reviewer wrote that the camera is beautiful and I agree.Unlike the other HooToo cams, which I mounted inside and onto a house, I chose a harsh outdoor environment about 100 feet away from the house, where the camera is exposed to salt-water spray and heavy weather. This required construction of a mounting post, a trench for a buried power cable, and over two months of experimentation with various mounting and wiring configurations.For those familiar with the HooToo web-based programming interface, the setup is identical for this camera when compared with the other two HooToo's IP cam products I already own (five other cams). Programming any IP camera (whether HooToo or not) requires a fair amount of computer experience and patience. Even with a fair background in network technology, I found the learning curve steep with the first cams. However, having programmed five other cams in the past year (both wired and wireless on a network with bridged extensions), programming was familiar and uncomplicated with this new IP006N camera.For those unfamiliar with IP camera programming, the basic steps involve accessing the camera via a browser-based interface accessed on a LAN while the camera is plugged into an open Ethernet port on a same-network router. After accessing the camera, a port number must be assigned, wireless access enabled (with network settings and password) and Internet access programmed. Security settings, device names, email notification, and dozens of other settings can be configured as well.To allow Internet access to the camera, the network router must next be accessed to (1) configure a fixed LAN IP address for the MAC camera identifier and (2) open the router port to allow access to the LAN from the Internet. To reiterate, all of these steps are shared by other brands and models of IP cameras, so na\u00efve users should not be too quick to criticize HooToo if they have difficulties setting up their IP cams. For the non-tech-oriented user, this technology is complex and is best done by someone with network programming experience.For what it's worth, one of the reasons I initially chose HooToo over competing brands was its reputation as a company that prizes its customer service support. As other Amazon reviewers have commented, I found this to be completely true, and was more than impressed by HooToo's service accessibility, patience, and willingness to assist me with any question I raised about setting up any of its products. As a typical example, when one of my HooToo cams lost its dedicated web-accessible IP address, customer service sent me a specific personalized protocol to reset the cam, providing me with a new unique IP address for Internet camera access. This obviously took a fair amount of effort and time on their part and is not the kind of service I've ever received from other tech companies unless I was paying for tech support services (Microsoft, Apple, and HP come to mind).I've now had the camera working and under testing for about two months. No fault of the camera itself, but it took me a month to work out the installation and power kinks to get the camera to stay on and not repeatedly reset itself. Because of this experience and the limited number of reviews thus far (since it's a relatively new HooToo product as of November 2013), I'm going to list my criticisms of the camera before reporting further on its virtues.CONS:First, I found that the nominal operating voltage range for this camera is a bit tighter than the prior HooToo cameras I already installed. For comparison, the IP210F cams operate on 5VDC. In reality, I feed several of these IP210Fs using both the included AC bricks as well as lead-acid batteries off of a PV energy house system. Doing so, I've found the IP210F cam operates from a range of about 4.5-6.5VDC. It may operate at higher voltages too, but I don't want to risk burning out the main board by experimenting. Likewise, I've found the fixed outdoor IP212F operates from a range of about 11.5-14.5VDC.In contrast, this camera, the IP006N, has a narrower operating voltage range, about 12.0-13.0VDC. Above and below this range, the camera sometimes drops off the network or resets itself.Second, the wiring bundle (including connectors for Ethernet, microphone, speaker, and power) is not weatherproof and must be enclosed in a box to protect it from water and corrosion. I mounted a box on the pole beneath the camera for this purpose.Third, it took me several days to figure out that the protective dome unscrews to provide access to the camera itself, and that the reason I couldn't get the camera to fully pan or tilt was because the inner camera (under the dome) had been wrapped in foam to protect it during shipping. Opening the dome and removing the foam easily solved that problem. Incidentally, the camera is set up to be mounted with the dome down. (I originally mounted it dome forward and couldn't figure out why the pan and tilt controls were not intuitive. This was fixed as soon as I remounted it dome down.)My fourth criticism has to do with the apps that I use to control our cameras and view the images. Our technology is Apple-based, and Safari's interface doesn't allow easy control of any of HooToo's cams. (FireFox on Windows doesn't either.) Based on other Amazon reviews, I tried several iDevice-based apps and found the greatest functionality through the app, IP Cam Viewer Pro. This actually works better than the app suggested by HooToo's customer service. Nevertheless, when the IP006N is accessed over the Internet, any pan or tilt commands result in sending the camera to the extreme edge of its visual range, rather than simply advancing the camera a few degrees at a time. This is not a problem for the IP210F cams or when accessing the IP006N over the LAN.Fifth, the video recording feature on this (and all HooToo cameras) is not understandable. I can take still shots easily, saving them to a computer or device, or emailing them on the fly. Nevertheless, I am unable to figure out how to access video recordings I take on this or any HooToo camera.Lastly, at least one other reviewer has commented that the IP006N dome is not entirely waterproof. In two months of use, I've not noted this problem despite having had several major rain and windstorms. However, after reading about this possibility, I did ensure that the dome was fully screwed on after mounting the camera.PROS.For the price, the quality of this camera is unbeatable. Combined with customer support, I absolutely recommend this above the competition. HooToo actually mailed me a replacement IP006N after my initial one dropped off our network and I couldn't figure out how to reset it. (After much troubleshooting, it's possible that that problem was due to voltage fluctuations on our 12VDC buried cable rather than camera itself. Whatever the case, the new camera worked when the initial one did not.)Image quality is a major improvement over the less expensive indoor and outdoor HooToo cams that I have scattered around the house and porches. The ability to magnify images on the fly is something I always thought might be nice, but after seeing the quality of the IP006N video magnification, optical zoom functionality is something I now consider essential rather than simply optional.Brightness in day and dusk light settings is good. Night color correction is still a bit lacking, but better than non-corrected images from the other cameras. As other reviewers have noted, the infrared LED night illumination is limited to the area immediately around the camera. (Expecting more illumination is analogous to using a flash on a camera to take a night image of a football field. External lighting is required for such photos.)Overall, this new HooToo offering provides customers with a high-quality weatherproof, PTZ IP camera at a great price point. After some initial installation and setup issues, I now have wireless access to superb video from over 100 feet from the nearest router in a harsh outdoor environment. HooToo offers excellent support despite the complex technology and setup required. The camera has excellent daytime and good night images, near 360 panning, great zoom features, and an interface accessible with user-friendly apps.

I have 4 IP camera in and outside the home with motion detection setup on each using ftp to load images to a server.  I'll start with the bad, but since I gave this camera 5 stars the bad isn't actually that bad.  I'm the type of person who like to make sure the firmware is the latest version before I get started.  If you're like me you'll notice version 41 is the latest version on hootoo website, while version 49 is on the camera.  Don't attempt to put the old version 41 on.  If you try like me, you'll need to load the cd that comes with the camera to get the firmware back to a workable version (I couldn't find it online).  However, during this process I called HooToo (Sunvalleytek) office to see if they could help.  I was surprised to have someone immediately answer the phone and quickly get my issues resolved.  They even offered to RMA my product at no charge even though it was just a firmware update.  I've been so please with the company and the camera and company that I just ordered another.  Thanks to Winnie & Raymond at Sunvalleytek to give me the confidence in their company.  The other thing that made me hesitant about buying it was; it wasn't an amazon prime item.  I get spoiled with the 2 day shipping.  You'll be happy to know that Sunvalleytek sends their items USPS 2 day priority (that was a pleasant surprise).As far as the camera, I read reviews saying the camera is bigger than people expected.  I guess that made me expect something bigger.  The camera is 6\" long and about 3\" in diameter.  It's in an all metal housing with a 2ft pigtail where you plug in the network cable (if needed) and power.  It has a nice 6dbi antenna which give me great reception even outside the home (my router is in the basement).  It comes with a mount.  The mount can be used as a free stand on a shelf or used with the rotating arms mount on a wall.  The mount like the camera is all metal, and is actually very good.  It even came with it's own allen wrench to tighten.The picture is far superior to my other cameras.  The night vision has no troubles and is crystal clear.  I happy using this camera day or night.  The ftp, motion detection, and port forwarding all work as expected, and I can see my camera with very little setup from outside the home network.  Plus I never have any wireless connectivity issues.The setup:I thought not going with foscam was going to make the setup more difficult, but that wasn't the case.1) Plug the camera into power and network over CatV.2) Open the IPCam tool.  The great thing about the tool is it actually don't make you install it, very small exe to do what it needs to do.  This is just used to get/set the IP address.  If you look at your router you can also determine what IP your camera is using assuming your on the 192.168.1.x subnet mask.  I used this tool to set the static IP address.  I also used it to set a different port number so I can see it from outside my home network.3) Go to the IP address in your browser to finish the setup.4) This is where you add it to your wireless network.  One gotcha is I had to scan twice for any networks to show up.5) This should be it for a basic setup.  If you want to see you camera from outside you network make sure to setup your router with port forwarding.I will note on the ftp setup I kept trying to run the test to insure it was working and it kept failing.  I think the buttons are out of order, so make sure you \"submit\" before testing.Overall, good camera, good customer service, and a great price.

The aluminum case is shiny and heavy duty.  Feel somewhat heavy due to its profession build.  It comes with a taller than usual high-gain antenna.I used the IPCamera.exe setup tool from hootoo.com website without touching the enclosed installation CD. I first connected it to my home router using an Ethernet cable and attached the camera antenna. The IPCamera.exe software immediately found the camera on the LAN. Right clicking within the software on the camera (named  initially by factory as \"Anonymous\") shows some menus. Using one menu I changed the LAN IP to the fixed IP number 191.168.1.236 that I wanted (so that it is close to the IP numbers of my other Hootoo IP cameras).  I also set the port to 8091 because my other camera has 8085, 8086... In Google Chrome, I typed in 192.168.1.236:8091 to access web configuration.  Within the web interface, I set all the other parameters including WiFi connection password, smtp.gmail.com account information and camera alias, etc. Motion detection parameters can be set right there.  It is nice that you can choose to receive an e-mail to inform you that the camera just rebooted and together with its WAN IP number. DNS server is built in, but I never bothered to use it because my RoadRuner modem IP has not changed for years even during electricity outages.  The e-mail notification of WAN IP will help if my IP ever changes.  I then unplugged the Ethernet cable. Using the IPCamera.exe tool, you will find the camera running WiFi. Use the indicated IP:port to access the camera. The setup process is pretty much the same as other Hootoo IP cameras and other similar IP cameras from many other vendors.  I use Android's IP Cam Viewer app to view all of my IP cameras. One interesting observation is that the HT-IP212 camera (with all aluminum casing) does not seem to interfere with my remote control of the garage door opener at all, unlike IP cameras with plastic casing. A huge plus for me. Not a surprise though because people have suggested wrapping a camera's plastic casing with tin foil to reduce radio waves coming out the plastic camera (even when wired connection is used rather than WIFi).I put an Android phone running IP Webcam and a PT IP camera side by side with HT-IP212. The camera views had a shaded area and a bright area (farther away). HT-IP212 definitely controlled light exposure better. The other two cameras overexposed and the farther away area was too bright and not clear. I also noticed that HT-IP212 seems to have a slight telescopic view.  It has a larger view on the far away area. I think it is designed that way. Instead of a 3.6 mm lens like many  startup IP cameras, HT-IP212 has a 6 mm lens.  I really like this camera. It watches my driveway for me.This camera's obvious drawback is that you cannot be remotely pan and tilt via software like the plastic indoor models. This is by design. For the price point, I could desire this kind of expensive functions. Even more expensive ones don't do that. Like all outdoor cameras, I would not expose it directly under the sun or let the lens see the sun to prolong the lifespan. I didn't test the waterproof ability because I shelter it.

It can pan through almost 360 degrees although panning to look at its mounting facility, building or pole makes no sense.  It has no audio although it does have one foot long cables to connect to an audio input or output as well as the power cable and a reset function.  These connectors must be protected from the elements so mounting them on a building with a grommeted access hole is the best way to mount it.  I have mounted mine on top of a 12 foot 4x4 post which is part of my deck.  I can view all of the deck, my side yard and my back yard from high atop the post.  I have enclosed the wires and connectors in a plastic box which is watertight.Although the camera is intended to be used for security purposes it has such good resolution and color rendition that I have used it to watch the wildlife around the deck.  I have monitored the activity of deer in the back yard and found the culprit chewing on my wife's hostas, and I have watched any of a dozen species of birds come and go on our birdfeeders.The camera software comes with motion picture and snapshot capability so I have videos on my computer of all of the wildlife.  It also has a very nice 3x zoom with which I can photograph the colorful birds on our feeders.  The red bellied woodpecker has been recorded many times coming to the suet feeders.  The motion detection feature set at a sensitive position starts the video recording as the woodpecker lands on the suet feeder and records for whatever preset time you have selected.  It can also be programmed to send snapshots of the frame to an email address.The preset positions available in the software make it possible to switch rapidly from one place to another rather than using the up-down, left-right buttons.  Just tell the camera to focus in close up mode to position 3 and it moves to view the suet feeder in 3x zoom mode.  Then tell it to go to position 7 and it is now focused on wide-angle view of the back yard.The night vision combined with the motion detection feature has allowed me to capture a video of a skunk prowling on the deck just in time to stop me from stepping out on the deck to fill the bird feeders for the morning.  One downside of the night vision is that viewing at the 90 and 180 degree position there is some sort of internal reflection of the IR LEDS which makes viewing from the extreme left and right pan position to about 90 degrees from each position useless.  Daytime viewing presents no problems at all.At night I point the camera at the sliding door to our sunroom and set the motion detection system to be active, I sleep knowing that any intruders will trip the alarm, record video of their activity and wake me up as the alarm on my laptop alerts me to the unsub's activity, a very comforting feeling!!All in all the camera meets all of my needs with its good resolution, color rendition and 3X zoom features along with its complete alarm capabilities.", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Techie says its never worked.", "Author": "K.

The camera housing is metal and it has a thick plastic removable dome to protect the camera itself.  I will have to see down the line how it holds up to the elements but right now I am confident that will not be a problem.The setup was just like any other Hootoo ip camera that I have owned, easy and straight forward.  No need to be a geek to get it going (though I am and it usually helps!) the only thing that is sometimes tricky for folks is routing the ports through the firewall for external access to the camera but that is different for every router so you might have to do some research depending on your individual router to get that going.The first step is usually to attach the camera to an ethernet cable attached to you router so that you can setup the wifi for your network.  Once that step is done, and that is easy enough, you can disconnect the ethernet cable and access the camera through wifi.The next step is deciding where to mount the camera.  One thing which would make that decision easier is if the camera had POE then an electrical outlet would not be necessary but POE has it's problems at times as well which may be why Hootoo has decided not to add that support to this camera.  Anyway in my case I have not actually decided where the optimal spot for the camera is so I mounted it temporarily on a piece of PVC pipe so I can attach it to various places around my house and see which view I like best and then I will evaluate the images and decide on it's permanent home. This is something I would probably suggest to anyone with any camera so that you don't end up having regrets on where the camera is mounted.  So far I have moved the camera twice and I am still not sure so it may take another move or to two to settle in on the right spot!Some people have commented that the video from this camera is grainy.  I have not found this to be true at all.  Day or night I think the image from the camera is quite good.  Of course it is not HD quality but it is not advertised to be and if that is what you are looking for then there are many choices out there for that at a significantly increased price range!I love the speed at which this camera pan and tilts.  Some of the other cameras I have owned are quite slow in this regard but not this one.  It is quite zippy!  Having the 3x optical zoom is also a nice feature and quite useful.The night vision on this camera works well.  It is not as bright as some other cams but that is probably due to the infrared leds being spread out around the circumference of the cam housing so you have infrared light in all directions.  So since it is not a focused beam of infrared leds you lose a little bit of distance on the night vision but i think that works much better that some cams which have the leds focused around the lens but inside the plastic dome because then the ir bounces off the dome into the lens and the night vision does not work at all.  So I think the setup on this camera is the best compromise, lose a little night vision distance but have night vision that works.  I would say that is a fair trade in my book!Overall,  I am quite pleased with this camera.

HooToo has made the HooToo\u00ae HT-IP006N PTZ PRO Indoor/Outdoor Wireless IP Camera as a way to maintain a secure atmosphere.\u25b6 Package Contents\u2022 IP Camera\u2022 Wi-Fi Antenna\u2022 User manual\u2022 DC power supply cord\u2022 CD Rom\u2022 Ethernet cord\u2022 4 mounting screws with drywall inserts\u25b6 AccessoriesThe Ethernet cord is 56 inches with a thick gauged wire. Although the cord is short, this is definitely one of the better built Ethernet cords I own. The Ethernet cord will do what it is intended for and help setup the IP camera.The DC power cord is 59 inches with a 3.5 x 1.75 x 1.25 inch brick at the end of the cord. I would normally name this a con, because it would block neighboring outlets, but I would expect this cord to be attached to some sort of extension cord and not a surge protector.\u25b6 HardwareI have to say that this camera looks a lot smaller and lighter than the pictures indicate (10 x 6.5 x 9.5 inches; 3.5 pounds).The back of the camera has four mounting placements and a 27 inch cord that has 5 expandable connectors and 1 reset button: Ethernet port with 2 LED indicators, audio output, audio input, I/O Alarm Pin, and Power input. I like that this includes expandable audio input/output and I/O for alarm, but wish this would actually include these features built in.The right side of the mounting bracket has the placement for the 7.5 inch antenna which is able to bend in a 360 degree motion, giving the best placement when trying to connect to Wi-Fi. On the opposite side is the MAC ID, DDNS, User: admin, Password: blank, Model Number: HT-IP206N, Checkmarks on Wireless and IR CUT, and approvals from CE, FCC, RoHS.The top casing of the camera is a metal that is 4 x 6 x 6 inches with the blue HooToo logo. The actual casing of the camera is plastic half circle that is 4.5 x 4.5 x 3 inches. This half circle is able to be screwed off, and I will note that there will be a Styrofoam material inside. This was done for packaging purposes and should be removed before use. Inside the camera lens is about 0.75 inches, and is able to be rotated in a 360 degree motion by the motor inside. I like feature as I can get the most out of the camera. Around the plastic casing is 6 x 12 IR LED lights to allow the best picture for the camera.\u25b6 Specifications\u2022 Video features: Adjustable image size and quality; time stamp; flip and Mirror\u2022 Wireless connectivity: 802.11b/g Wireless with WEP/WPA/WPA2 security\u2022 Network protocol: HTTP, FTP, TCP/IP, UDP, SMTP, DHCP, PPPoE, DDNS, UPnP, GPRS\u2022 Browser: IE 6.0/ 7.0/ 8.0, Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome\u2022 Night vision (built-in LED illuminators to enable the night functionality)\u2022 View angle: Its 69\u00b0 wide viewing angle allows you to reach much broader range at the single sight\u2022 Online management: up to 9-cam\u2022 OS: Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7\u2022 Certificate: Approved by CE, FCC, RoHS\u25b6 Software SetupHooToo provides two pieces of software for this device \u201cIP Camera Tool\u201d and \u201cIPCamClient\u201d. Don\u2019t worry if you are initially confused, because I was. After reading the manual, \u201cIP Camera Tool\u201d is the only tool required. Follow the following directions to install your camera:1. Install the \u201cIP Camera Tool\u201d and then restart your computer.2. Plug your DC power supply into your camera and power your device.3. Wait approximately 30 seconds for your device to be read4. Open the \u201cIP Camera Tool\u201d Program5. You should see \u201cAnonymous\u201d and \u201cSubnet doesn\u2019t match, double click to change!\u201d6. Check the box \u201cObtain IP from DHCP Server\u201d This will automatically setup your device that is connected to your router. If you want to change the user/password and HTTP Port then feel free to.7. Your device should be connected. Congratulations. Now, you will be redirected to a website that you can view your camera. If you want to make this device wireless then continues to step 8.8. After you are on your website i.e 192.168.0.12/main.htm click the Network tab and then \u201cWireless Lan Settings\u201d.9. Click the Scan button under \u201cWireless Network List\u201d10. Choose your network, key, and then click the submit button.11. Congratulations, you should now be able to use your camera wirelessly!Although these steps seem very simple from my review they weren\u2019t as intuitive while attempting to setup the device. However, if you are reading this then congrats, you just saved yourself 3 hours of troubleshooting.\u25b6 SoftwareThe website includes tabs for \u201cLive Video, Multi-Device, Network, Audio Video, System, and Other\u201d.Live video- Self explanatoryMulti-Device- Upgrade device firmware, restore to factory settings, or reboot device. I would assume this would be used for multi-camera view, but it is instead used for factory settings.Network- Basic network settings, wireless LAN settings, ADSL settings, UPnP settings, DDNS Service settingsAudio video- Reversal, mirror. This has no audio settings, but may have settings when an audio source is connected.System- Device settings, alias settings, Date and Time settings, User settings, PT Settings, (LED) indicator settings, backup and restore settings, log, and MSN settings. Nothing really to note here other than it includes \u201cMSN Settings\u201d; an instant massaging program that has been discontinued since 2013.Other \u2013 Mail service settings, FTP server settings, Alarm settings. I like that this includes settings for FTP and mail services so you can always be updated of the images from your work.Under the vertical tabs are options to change \u201cResolution, Mode, Bright, and Contrast\u201d.Resolution \u2013 160 x 120, 320 x 240, 640 x 480Mode \u2013 50 Hz, 60 Hz, OutdoorBright \u2013 0 to 15Contrast \u2013 0 to 6Unfortunately, this camera only supports (up to) a 4:3 aspect ratio, which is nowhere near standard 5:4 (1280 x 1024) or HD 16:9 (1920 x 1080). I understand that this would probably be done to cut the costs of the camera, but I wish the camera would output a higher resolution.Under that is a circular compass to move the camera whichever direction you want. Under the compass are 8 buttons for \u201cSet preset position, Call preset position, Zoom in, Zoom out, Horizon Patrol, Stop Horizon Patrol, Switch on, and Switch off.\u201d I like that this device\u2019s web page includes so many options for the camera. Although the website doesn\u2019t look very appealing, it is very functional for the purpose of the camera. At the right top is an option to take a \u201cSnapshot\u201d image of the live camera feed.\u25b6 InstallationOn the back of the mounting bracket are 4 placements to drill the included screws into. From there, connect it to a power source and find the LAN IP that the IP Cam program provides. Setup should be completed if you followed these steps.\u25b6 TestingAfter I successfully mounted the camera to the wall of my house, I was ready to test. The pictures aren\u2019t HD but you can clearly make out details on the objects. As seen in my first product image, you can see that the truck has obvious erosion, and you can make out pigmentation from the pavement and grassy hill. Please excuse both of my images, as I am using evaluation software, and have yet to purchase the full version. In the second product image you will see another truck in pitch black. The night vision works very nice, and you can clearly make out objects. I noticed from my night vision test that the higher you place the camera, the better. I was able to successfully place the camera on the top of the roof and still maintain a strong WiFi signal, which is approximately 30 feet to the router. During my tests I did notice times when moving objects would lag the camera, and the camera signal going out for a few minutes, but these issues didn\u2019t happen often. I did want to note that these occurrences did happen.  This camera seemed too performed well in snow, rain, or sun. The only other issue I saw was that the plastic cover would need cleaned often to receive the clearest possible picture. I overall was satisfied with these results, as I was able to see clearly see objects.\u25b6 Final thoughtsThis camera is only a little above the $200 price tag and has several different features, which adds great value to the device. The main issue is the software, as it is less than spectacular, but chances are you will be buying a good IP camera management system, such as Blue Iris. Despite this issue, I see more than enough reason to recommend this camera and give this a 5 star rating. HooToo created a good wireless camera that has good enough picture for business or residential.Pros:+ Able to be used indoors and outdoors, during daytime or nighttime, but be sure to waterproof your cords before using it outside.+ Includes several options such as presets, zoom in and out, and horizon patrol. These are great functional settings that optimize the camera\u2019s capabilities.+ Includes options for FTP and mail service so you can monitor your home while you are at work.+ Antenna is able to bend in 360 degree motion to give the best Wi-Fi connection.Cons:- Camera only supports up to 4:3 aspect ratio (640 x 480), which is nowhere near standard or HD resolution.- Software design is functional but is frustrating to use and isn\u2019t very aesthetically pleasing.- Includes ability for audio in/out and alarm in/out but doesn\u2019t include them built into the camera.I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "For the price not that great.", "Author": "Rodney Young", "ReviewID": "RFME8AW5HC7Z9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Here's the pro's. During the day the camera does descent, but not great video.(Blue Iris had very grainy video for software everyone says is so great). The Quality of the video seems to change when you restart the camera. It says 355 degree Horizontal but its actually 360, I marked a point on my window and it will fully rotate to the point in either direction on patrol. Its.well built with exception of dome, its plastic and panning fully up part of picture is obscured by a ring that is 1/4 wide all around the dome and distorts the view, so mount this camera high. Glass would of been better for durability and clearer picture. The Wifi signal so far is good to about 90 feet, that's as far as I needed to go and didn't have another extension cord to test farther. Motion detection works very well.Cons: Night vision- forget it, without expanded IR lights or very bright yard light this thing is nearly blind, the LUX is not low enough. The built in IR lights are good for about 10 feet then fade out fast. The example screen shown for this camera at night are just false. The IR lights would be fine for a porch or small small area. Built in, rotating with camera IR's would of been far far better. Unless your a pro at networking, set up is a bear. You need to first get it working on Lan with IPcamera tool first then after working with your router can jump to wireless, from there to actually seeing it on internet after using a site like no-ip.com to get a dynamic ip address. I know some networking but I am a novice at best, took 2 days to get this to finally work. Using I-Spy free version is the best software to me as it will track and identify any movement or can get a plugin for facial recognition. No other free or trial software including Blue Iris will do this that I found. Without the auto camera tracking might as well buy a stationary bullet camera. con or no there is a minimum of 3 seconds to as high as 15 depending on your bandwidth of lag time for all movements , but seems inherent to security cameras. While I think as many Hootoo is a respectable company, this camera needs minor improvements to be worth its price or at least exceed Foscam and other PTZ IP cameras. Since I see i didn't mention my setup is outdoors. I tried it near porch, and ended up mounting high up on my power pole which has a yard light attached, then added 96 led expansion lights X 4 to cover areas that the yard light couldn't which helps 10X over. If you buy this try the free version of I-Spy software and play with the settings, can make this an interesting PTZ.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fabulous customer service; Bad user manual; tough on Mac users", "Author": "BookLover \"BookLover\"", "ReviewID": "R3RR2AG53MCWM7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "REVISED REVIEWThe product seller let me keep the camera, where it sat for many months until my dog required me to get a camera to keep an eye on him when away from home.

My old DVR surveillance system with wired cameras died after several years of service.

Whenever the camera detects motion it will generate an email with 6 attachments. You can adjust the sensitivity for these alerts and several other settings on the camera.After looking at ways to mount the new camera I realized that power would be an issue since none of my old outdoor wired cameras were located near a 120V outlet and I specifically wanted to replace them with the wireless device. The HooToo HT-IP212 comes with a power adaptor that has a cord of approx 6ft. Due to oversight on my part I have decided to return the unit and replace my old DVR unit with a new one.

The 8 preset positions are enough to completely view every bit of the yard. The 640x480 image is adequate for surveillance, but I have my doubts about picking up good face shots.The real test came at night. The IR image is also adequate for most purposes. The showstopper was the halo effect caused by nearby driveway and street lights. The halos occur even when the camera is pointed in directions away from the light. I imagine this is due to the covering over the lens assembly, and not a defect in the camera itself. But it made the camera fairly unusable for me for  nighttime use. The camera I replaced it with has no cover so it doesn't have that halo problem. However, the cover does provide a bit of uncertainty because someone approaching doesn't know in which direction the camera is pointing.So, if nighttime lights aren't going to be a problem, I would say this is a camera that may meet your needs.", "Date": "May 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good but was hoping for better", "Author": "fRiEdfiSh \"Gills\"", "ReviewID": "RMF6B1FXMTYQR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was going to use this for the front of my house to get a full view.

The hope was to have a device that would be able to show me a picture of the distant mountains and surrounding scenery as well as be able to give me a good idea of the weather conditions.  I needed a standalone wireless camera that would link to my router, but would not require a full time computer.  I wanted something compatible with Windows 7, Windows Vista and that would work with my Droid.  I was also hoping for a system that I would allow me to expand and add cameras.  Ease of setup and operation was also important.After researching the many outdoor IP cameras available, I settled on the HooToo IP212.  My order arrived within two days.  The basic setup was very easy.  When it came to how to set up the remote viewing of the camera I did not fully understand the instructions.  The problem was solved with a little Googling and from there it was no time at all before I could view my new camera from any computer or smart phone.I have found that the IP-212 came with everything I needed to set it up.  It also comes with a mounting bracket that is decent quality, but I had to use a different bracket for my installation as I wanted to mount the camera under my eve facing straight away from the house and the bracket included was not long enough for this.  For a $1.50 this was an easy problem to fix.I have had the camera up and running for a month now and have not had any problems.  During the test phase I had the camera mounted on a regular tripod.  The picture was outstanding!  The details are very clear and sharp, but the color is slightly washed out except in bright sunlight.  My understanding is if you want true color you need to get a camera with \u201cIR cut off\u201d.  The night vision is excellent up to about 20 feet from the camera.  Much further the night feature doesn't seem to work as well.  I currently have the camera mounted in its permanent home and I am still quite pleased with its performance.The support staff at HooToo is very knowledgeable and helpful.  I needed assistance during my search to find the right camera, so I called the toll free number and left a message.  I received a call back within 30 minutes from one of their technicians and had all my questions answered.  I was told if I had any problems with the setup to call back and they would be happy to help me.  I have been very happy with the HooToo customer service.To date, my overall satisfaction rating with the IP-212 camera and the customer service staff at HooToo is easily a four or five star.

I am not saying this will happen to every customer but they do have great service. Aside from the NIC failing (perhaps I should use a surge protector) The camera itself is well built and durable.

customer support from HooToo.  I was blown away with their incredibly friendly, helpful, USA based customer support team.  HooToo had provided me a sample of this product in exchange for a fair and honest review on Amazon.  I was a little leary about setting this guy up but knew it would be great if I could get it to work and HooToo's Customer Support Team reassured me that they could help me if I ran into any difficulty.  I have Verizon Fios, a home Mac running OS X Mavericks and a Windows Laptop running WIndows 7.  I also have very little experience with the IT background that you will need to do this yourself but want to share my experience.  If you want to see the highlights and my review of the camera go down to the PROs and CONs section.THE EXPERIENCEI unpacked the camera and didn't really know where to get started.  Luckily, HooToo provided a Quick Installation Guide so that's where I started.  First you plug in the included RJ-45 ethernet cable to your router and provide power to it.  Next you take the CD that came with the camera and load it into your computer.  I first put it into my Mac and was clueless and could not find the right file to get it going.  I decided to give it a try in my Windows 7 laptop and had a lot better success with that - so that is my first tip - set this thing up in Windows if you can.  Once you install and run the HooToo IP Camera Tool you should see your IP camera's IP address on your network.  Double click on the IP address and you will go to that IP address on your web browser.  You will be prompted for a username and password - put in admin and leave the password blank and log in.  Here is tip number two - use Chrome.  At first I used Internet Explorer 9 and had all sorts of issues with the ActiveX controls and getting it to work.  I tricked out all of the settings and set my PC to the lowest security settings and finally got it to work.  Once I found the Chrome workaround I went back and reset all of my IE values to their default values.You finally get to see the camera image, get to play around with the pan and tilt functions and get a sense of accomplishment.  However, your sense of accomplishment will be short lived because you need to set this up to be a wireless camera.  Have no fear, HooToo customer support is here.  This is about as far as I could get on my own.  I called HooToo and spoke to Raymond and he saved the day for me.  After conversing a little bit, I decided it would be easier to download some software so he could hop onto my computer and get this camera set up.  That is tip number three because this makes it incredibly easier to get across the finish line.  I answered all of Raymond's questions and he just went to town on my computer.  We got hung up because I had never logged into my router before.  I called Verizon Fios customer support - eventually they had me hit the reset button on my router - here is the ironic part - I needed Internet Explorer to be able to re-enter my new password.  I called Raymond back and he set me all up.  I told him I wanted to set it up on my iPhone as well as be able to view it remotely.  Raymond then proceeded to set up port forwarding on my router and walked me through the whole thing as he was doing it.  Once I was all set up he cleared up my last issue, which was using Internet Explorer with the HooToo website.  I couldn't get the wireless settings pop-out tabs to show and when I logged in using Chrome - you guessed it, it worked - tip number 4.  So use Windows to install IP Camera Tool, use Chrome to view the image, call HooToo customer support if you get hung up and use Chrome to toggle the settings on HooToo's website.Yes, the camera and its features are important but so is the ease-of-use in setting it up for the novice.PROS*640x480 at 15 fps, 320x240 at 30 fps*A great value as far as features versus cost*Nightvision is excellent*Motion Detection - Can set up e-mail alerts and snap photos upon motion activation*Comes with CD, mounting bracket and screws, Quick Installation Guide, illustrated User's Manual, RJ-45 cable, power adapter*50 Hz, 60 Hz, Outdoor modes*Optimized MJPEG video compression for transmission*Wifi 802.11 b/g*Outstanding customer support - Makes all the difference in the world for a novice setting one of these up*IP66 rated, durable waterproof cameraCONs*No pan/tilt/zoom, but I knew this wasn't a PTZ camera to start out with*Learning curve - make sure you have some time on your hands when you unpack this and go for it*Unit is heavy and mounting support mechanism is not the best.  You can see what it looks like in my review, the mounting bracket that makes contact with the wall needs to be thicker.  If HooToo could redo the whole mounting bracket to something that is sturdier and reduce some weight from the head this would be a better product.*The unit is large, a smaller unit would be more conspicuous*The cable that comes from the unit is a little weird but HooToo did that so the can could be IP66 rated*Setup was pretty tricky for a novice.  I had no idea where to go on the included CD on my Mac.  I eventually used the Quick Installation Guide and Windows to get the IP Camera Tool program installed.  HooToo can do a better job of walking the novice through this.  They sent me some links on Youtube but here is what I think they should do.  I think they should make the CD such that you select whether you are installing it on a Mac or Windows.  From there, you watch a series of videos that show you how to get the camera installed.  I think that will provide a lot of value for the user because it will make his or her life easier.  I am talking about full videos from unpacking to port forwarding.  I know that setup will be different on everyone's network but seeing someone else do it would build some confidence in the user.  There could also be different videos for the different types of installs - all the way through from either a Mac or a Windows machine.  I think they could do a better job with the Quick Start Guide as well, it could be bigger and include more explanations of what you are going to do and how you are going to do it.  It needs to walk you through the process better.As far as Apps for your iPhone or Android phone, I found Surveillance Pro for Foscam (this is a generic IP camera and a lot of the Foscam Apps will work this camera just fine).  I also found uFoscam: 2way Audio & AV Record worked pretty good as well - it can crash on IOS 7 although they are working to fix that.The best thing about this camera is that it is an excellent value.  You really get a lot of bang for your buck.  The HooToo customer support team should alleviate any concerns that you might have about not getting this camera to work.  Even though I was provided a sample for testing I would not hesitate to get another camera from them on my own because I know they would help get it to work for me.  There are no real cons here really for me...People need to remember that a HD cam will also chew up a lot of bandwidth - 640 x 480 is plenty for me.I was provided a sample by the manufacturer in exchange for a fair and honest review.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Color or Black and White?", "Author": "Bruce Sutherland", "ReviewID": "RXDKVOMY1UNHC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Nice camera.

It worked great indoors, had a nice sharp picture, awesome night vision (the best I have seen on an IP camera at this price point).  When I put it outside, everything was out of focus, the colors were off and the night vision was horrible.  On top of all that, this camera has a very plastic feeling to it.  I doubt it would have lasted for a Minnesota winter.The main reason that I went with this camera was the optical zoom.  I ended up going with the Agasio camera which does not zoom, but at least it is in focus.I would consider this model if I did have the need for an indoor PTZ which I do not.Overall I am disappointed in this purchase and am returning it thanks to Amazon's awesome return policy.PROS-Optical zoom which functioned indoors-Worked great with Blue Iris softwareCONS-Plastic feel, not durable-Lacks POE function-Wireless did not work well at all-Horrible picture outdoorsUpdate:  I did receive an e-mail from Sunvalley Tek today regarding this review offering some suggestions and technical support information.

That'll get you every time.*  Hookup and TEST your camera completely before installation.* motion alarm based picture taking and emailing is good, practice and tweak various sensitivity settings* be sure you write down the model number - it's nowhere on the web interfaceThings I wish this camera had:*  POE Support - so I don't need the AC Adapter*  Night Vision - I haven't installed an IR illuminator yet, but will try it.

As mentioned many time, instructions are poorly written using poor English.  I am a novice to web cams,  set up home network on my own, but that is no big deal.  I bought a new linksey 900 router also at the start of this instillation.  I followed the instructions and had the camera up and running in minutes wired.  Wireless is another matter,  the instructions say just unplug the cable (after doing the install for wireless) and you should be wireless.  but it did not happen over and over and over again.  I eventually discovered that even though it supposed to take effect in 30 secs,  it some times takes up to an hour before the camera is recognized.  I bought two cameras and after days of fussing I got them both working,  for less than a day.  First the front cam went out,  had to take it down and start over.  Then the back cam went down,  repeat and repeat.  I would think that once they are up and working they would stay working but that has not been my experience. Currently they are both NOT working.  I see a couple of options,  wire them which is not why I bought these and paid what I did to get them,  or send them back.  I am leaning hard towards sending them back. The back cam is 30-40 feet away from the router, the front cam maybe 50 feet,  well within the limits.  When I had them working they worked good and I was satisfied. It just didn't last long.
