{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing development for CCTV applications.", "Author": "Zeke33309", "ReviewID": "R1H6PFU8PCPWJS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My company just installed these Eyecast Cloud Vaults in our office.  They work amazingly well.  I can view the office in real time from my computer and iPhone 24 hours per day with excellent resolution and refresh rate, and all of the playback, archiving, and exporting is done online and can be performed remotely.  We replaced our hard drive based DVR storage system with these devices (the existing cameras plug right in) and the upgrade was tremendous.  Further, if anything happened to the actual old DVRs (theft, fire, flood, power surge, etc.), all of the stored data / recordings would be lost.  This system, since it is cloud based, prevents the loss of any data due to DVR damage / loss.  Also you can expand the storage service online with Eyecast, so it is very flexible.  The owners and representatives of Eyecast are also very personable and will address any questions immediately.  Very satisfied with this product and service.  Highly recommend the company and product.", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BTJIF30"}}
