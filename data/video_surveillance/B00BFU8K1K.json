Shipping label printed but not put in shipping channels.  When asked for expedited shipping after 2.5 weeks (and item still hadn't left warehouse), response received two days later that item was already in shipping channels (but tracking says dropped off same day I received email response).  Seller did nothing to correct their shipping error nor acknowledge they had made a mistake.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BFU8K1K"}}
