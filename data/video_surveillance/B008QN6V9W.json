Leamon", "ReviewID": "R53UU1GYC3NWJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had no problem setting up the camera.  Accessing the camera from my laptop, desktop and Samsung Galaxy 3S was easy.  I got notifications every time lightning even flashed momentarily.  After less than 1 month though everything went to hell.  First the camera became stuck in black-and-white mode.  Then when accessing the archive from my desktop I could only get sound and not video (oddly enough everything seemed fine when accessing from my laptop and phone).  Then when I tried to access live view I repeatedly got a notice that the camera was busy...try back in a few minutes.  Then I got notices that the camera was not connected.I tried resetting the camera and router from the ground up and everything seemed to work again...live view...video recording...color...for about an hour.  Once again everything turned to crap.  Be prepared for frustration with this one in the long term.  Customer support is only minimally helpful and it takes them a day to respond to an email.  I'm not sure if the problems are with their hardware, software, or access through their web site, but there are definite problems.UPDATE!!!!  UPDATE!!!!  UPDATE!!!!I finally got the camera to work, but only after deleting everything and re-installing the camera.  Everything has worked without a hitch for several weeks except for a problem that their customer support has been unable to resolve. Since they are in the UK the time difference is a great hindrance to prompt solutions.  When accessing archived video on my computer I could hear the audio, but got no video.  The problem did not occur when accessing archived video from my phone.  Their solution was to update Flash or to try Chrome as my browser instead of IE 10.  THANKS!  After installing Chrome I now cannot find the camera in archived video OR live mode.  Everything has gone from bad to worse.  I have no problems with playing any other videos on any site except Home Monitor's site.  Once again, I apparently will have to re-install the camera, but I'm not sure now if even that will work.  I cannot recommend this camera!

Tech support at Y-Cam were very helpful when I had an issue with the first install but after that it was a very easy job to set the other two up.Both the desk top (Windows 7), Android (Samsung S3 & 4) and Apple touch apps work well and to date with very few issues. Online recordings work well and I've had no issues downloading the clips I wished to keep.Picture quality? Day time colour output is surprisingly good as is the night-time black and white. OK not broadcast quality but for the price/package its very good. The IR emitters work well at night but forget about using the indoor camera looking out of a window. If you have the IR emitters switched on and the camera close to the glass there is a lot of back glare. You can select for the IR's to be turned off so an external IR lamp could be used to provide night illumination. As with all things, the right tool for the job is a good idea which is probably why Y-Cam sell an outdoor model.

I had the camera up and running and in the middle of the night I tried to get it to record me entering the room. The light was on green and I had the motion detection on. It didn't record anything and I was in the room at least 10 seconds. not a good start.I tried updating the firmware to see if that would help. It would not update via WiFi (tried 3 times). I disconnected the camera and tried to update with the ethernet cable, that workedthen I put the camera back where it was and the headache began. it did not connect. I reset the camera, deleted the entire setup profile online and started overThe setup page kept giving me trouble then. I was constantly being logged off the site for no reason, and everything was giving errors. At this point any impatient person would be ready to return the unit... but I'm pretty patientAfter about an hour the setup process finished, but the motion detection zones image never loaded (it didn't before I updated the firmware either), but I thought it was no big deal at the timeContacted tech support and they didn't seem to understand what I was asking. Long story short I figured it out myself. The motion detection zones are in JavaScript, and I didn't have that installed. Nothing on their webpage mentions that part is JavaStill not working right after that though. the camera simply didn't record anything when I entered the room in the middle of night (what if someone broke in?!!?)Then last night I tried turning the sensitivity up. There is a bar that you can adjust between small movement and large movement. I adjusted it about 1/3 of the way up, from 2/3 which is the factory setting. I also had motion detection zones setup so there shouldn't be false alarmsso I tried again and went down by the camera in the middle of the night, trying to get it to record me. I noticed the green light blinking and thought SWEET, it must be working now right?!!?when I woke up I noticed at first my internet connection said it sent/ received 2.6GB overnight (not good because I have a download limit too)I went to check the video recorded and there was nothing. where did all this data go?!?! I seriously think the firmware update screwed up my camera and now all the settings are going to nowhere because its just not working right.considering sending this camera back :(Update: sent the camera back. got the Sharx VIPcella SCNC2700 instead. guess what works fine :)even before updating the firmware on the Y-CAM I wasn't very impressed with it. the FPS are low (Y-CAM doesn't even list the specs on this camera) and overall just slow response. I would recommend the Sharx one instead. its not as easy to setup, but its worth it.If you are considering the HomeMonitor I would NOT recommend it for security purposes anyway. even when working correctly it seems to miss recording things way too much", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Flakey product", "Author": "Leonardo A.

I had a minor issue with its operation but the technical support person was very helpful and I found that it wasn't a problem with the camera but rather how I was using it.  I bought two more a week later.  They work very well, although my DSL internet connection often isn't fast enough to utilize the app to its potential.  The picture quality and frame rate are quite good and the night vision is fantastic.  Motion detection zones are reliable as are the email alerts when any activity is captured.  This doesn't record constantly, only for the brief time anything activates the detection zone and remains active while in the zone, so most of my recorded clips are about 15-30 seconds in length.

I wanted something easy and it had to meet my every day needs. Plus my wife had to be able to learn to turn the camera on and off so it had to be easy to operate. I am so glad I chose this camera. Set up was easy and connecting to internet was a breeze. Only issue I had and it\u2019s not a deal breaker I could not see video on my internet explorer running windows 7. I do believe it was just a setting as my work computer running windows xp I could see it fine. I just switched to Google Chrome on my home computer and typed in homemonitoer.em and it came up instantly with video. Made all my necessary adjustments from there. I do love the 2 zone feature its great you can adjust these zones and there sensitivity to your liking. You can set times to record which is great only thing. I wish you could adjust them to the \u00bd not just the hour but once again not a deal breaker. As far as the phone I am running an old version android on my cell and its only 3g. I can pull up the screen for home monitor but can not see any video. I can turn on and off the motion and alerts from my phone as this main reason I use my phone is to turn the system on and off and it works very well. One thing I found out is when you load the homemonitor.me I have to refresh at once as long as I do that I can turn the camera on and off if not it seems to get confused but I believe that may be normal. The more than one e mail feature is great as my wife and I both get an e mail alert when a motion is detected. If we receive any e mail alerts our e mail send us a text instantly. (most cell phones you can do this on) I can see the alert in the text and pull it up on my e mail also. The picture feature in the email is a blessing, if you don\u2019t see any thing out of place you don\u2019t have to go any further and pull up the video. All in all I love this camera and have had no issues with it. I do recommend when you get one to give your self time about 2 or 3 weeks until you work out all the adjustment like times and zones and sensitivity to get the camera working as your liking.

The instructions are simple and if you follow them exactly, it takes little time to get the camera operational. It meets my needs for monitoring, providing an email/notification when there is motion. The wireless connectivity is great, giving flexibility for placement with respect to your wireless router.Two regions can be specified for motion-activated recording. You only get a brief clip to review while there is motion. The frame rate is sufficient for monitoring purposes and the image quality is sufficient. It is not HD and is not high-frame rate, but for most monitoring applications it isn't necessary to have that. With free web storage of the clips, it is easy to review them from any computer through the company's website, and using an app you can download for smart devices (iPhones etc). There's a little delay between motion activated recording and notification, but again for most purposes, this is OK. Sometimes, it can take 5 minutes or so for a newly recorded clip to become available through the app or on the web. In testing, comparing the push notifications to the app, with email notifications, it does appear that not every motion that generates a notification generates an email, though all clips are available for review. For this reason, I take off one star.I considered this and the DropCam. The Dropcam costs more, but is higher definition. It will also provide cloud recording (more than just clips) at a monthly subscription of $10. I figured I didn't need that capability.If you prefer to have video stored locally, you can't set that up with this camera.Night time vision is possible, with the IR LED array, and provides decent illumination over a reasonable distance. However, as with all such devices, if you are intending to place this behind a window to monitor outside activity, glass does not transmit IR very well, so you basically get to see a reflection of the LED array in the monitor.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent value", "Author": "Charles Ibis", "ReviewID": "R2LATASTV2LNKU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had two of these installed for a month. The new camera was easy and quick to install. The only snag on the second camera installation was caused by it being a refurnished unit (sold by Amazon Warehouse).  I had to wait an extra day to get the used camera unlocked by tech support in the UK, which is 8 hours ahead of me on the US west coast. The team was very responsive to my needs and I was up and running with the used camera in a day.I love that the online hosting is free for life. When motion is detected, an online video clip is available within a few minutes. The iPhone app is very useful in cases where I've been notified of motion outside the house when I'm not at home. There is about a 30 second lag before _live_ video appears on the app or web browser but the notification is almost immediate.Both of my cameras are mounted inside my house looking out a window. The picture quality is fine for standard def.  For example, I can recognize the gardener easily. The night vision would work well if not for the reflection on the glass. In truth, I should have purchased the outdoor model for more effective night vision but I don't have outside power so that was not an option for me. The wireless network aspect is useful but keep in mind that they need AC power to operate.Overall, I think these are an excellent value and the best deal for the money.
