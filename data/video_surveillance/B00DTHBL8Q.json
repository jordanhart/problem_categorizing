The VGA output did and I browsed through the menu system to see if there was a video source control.  There was not.  I noted that the front panel buttons are HORRIBLE.  They lack any tactile feel and it is difficult to navigate the menus using these buttons.  In any event, I boxed the system up and returned it for another.Upon powering the 2nd system up, I noted that again the HDMI output didn't work.  The rear panel around the power input looked like it had shipping damage.  The VGA output showed a splash screen that would intermittently appear then disappear.  Upon wiggling the power input cable, the DVR would turn on/off...Boxed the unit up and returned it for a refund.Never even got a chance to check out the camera...This company is simply shipping untested \"bricks\"...don't expect them to be around for much longerTroglobyte", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$599.99", "Features": "Swann 960H 9 Ch 4 Cam 700TVL 1TB Security System", "Name": "Swann 960H 9 Ch 4 Cam 700TVL 1TB Security System", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41DouCAxmfL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DTHBL8Q"}}
