Good range as camera is located at window in attic 50 ft from network router.can't use night feature as it reflects in window but that worked well when we tested on interior pictures as well.I would certainly recommend as I tried 2 \"wireless\" from other manufacturer and they never would hookup to network.

It worked so well that I emailed snapshots of the scenes from it (both day and night) to my son. He had been researching baby monitoring cameras for his twin boys' room. I purchased one for him and it is great! He set it up while I was there and when there was a 'noise' from their room, he could easily see if one was getting up or what was needed. In the meantime, I could check on my home and felt comfortable that all was well there. Even though I do have a security system, being able to see what is going on is more comforting than wondering if maybe the system was bypassed or...", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid quality", "Author": "Thet Han Aung", "ReviewID": "R2PII1P8H6O5C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good quality product usable right out of box if using iOS systems. If you are using PC to install, its a bit tricky if you don't know how to port forward your router. I haven't tested motion triggered recordings but video is smooth and watchable even on 3G iPhone.The Mount could be reconfigured also for different wall angles. You just have to unscrew and pop put the base to direction you want.Night vision is decent, bright up to a distance of 15 feet or so enough to detect non-moving bodies and some facial recognition and motion blurred shape recognition up to 30-40 feet. I had it for just 2 days now.", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this", "Author": "Georgia I. Demming", "ReviewID": "R22GPP01CEE4GN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this product!

My only issue is that I am unable to find an iPad app.  They only have an app for iphone.---UPDATEYou can download the ipad software \"IP CAM SOFT\".  It is $3.99.  Once downloaded setup a new camera and put in this URL:http://IPADDRESS/snapshot.jpgEnter in your login/password.  They do not have Trivision in the drop down list but if you select \"Panasonic BB Series\" it works.

Range is about 15 ft from Linksys WRT150N router. 50 ft was completely out of range, 25 ft was barely getting a signal out and still not picture. At 15 ft I get 5 fps. The ir range is about 15 ft. Supposedly there is a motion detection setting but it does not work, probably the software on the mini-CD software is not working as that would be a software function. The unit had a problem with three of the micro-SD cards. It finally was able to recognize a Sandisk 4G Class 2 I had as a last resort. Took it three tries to see it and format it then to see that it was \"ready.\" It gets two stars because I can almost use it but... I'm probably sending it back simply because the range is so poor and I need something that can get working at least 25 ft. I wonder if the outdoor units are as bad... they would be terrible to use if the range is the same.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$259.00", "Features": "Wireless N IP Camera With Dedicated Free iPhone/iPad and Android Apps. and Access video streams with different streams as per different browsers, such as IE/ Safari/ Firefox/ Chrome, And media players, such as Windows media player, Quick Time, VLC...etc\nHi-Resolution Wireless IP Security Camera with excellent infrared night vision(Max 45 feet) via 28 infrared high power LEDs to provide high levels of \"invisible\" light in complete darkness and turns on automatically in low light.
