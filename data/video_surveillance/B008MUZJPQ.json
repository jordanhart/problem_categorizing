The cameras are the weak point of the system.  Color is a little off - my trees look pink to the camera but green to my eyes.  Night vision is nearly non-existent.  The playback and backup features of the web interface don't work for me, but they work within the provided desktop application.  16 channels, 8 cameras included with room for 8 more - 8 camera and power cables included.  Does not come supplied with a cable to connect to a monitor or TV so you have to buy one.  No Hard drive installed, but easy to install.  Records at a full 30 frames per second on each channel.  With a 160GB drive I get about 5 days on 8 cameras.  At $280 a decent system for a budget.", "Date": "August 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great price, complete system", "Author": "barkkari", "ReviewID": "R374ANY4LB268T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This budget friendly system has everything you need to set up your security system and check it remotely.
