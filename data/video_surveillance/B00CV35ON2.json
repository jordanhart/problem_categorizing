I've hooked it up correctly and still no color. Also, when I turn all the lights off, all I see is blackness meaning it is NOT IR night vision as described. I will update my review depending on the outcome of how they decide to settle this.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Suitbale for car rearview, video meeting, schools, supermarkets, shops, workshops, warehouses, offices, visual telephone, visual E-mail, PC multi-media-toys, games, monitoring, guardianship, anti-burglary, safeguardor other special tasks.\n?It equipped with infrared ray, can view objects without outside light source\nIt can work together with other equipment including PC to filming, photographing, complex video signal PAL(CCR).\nIt can be powered on for a long time, but the input voltage can not be exceeded DC12V, while current can not be exceeded 250MA.\nThe yellow plug is video output, it can be connected with varieties of monitors and TV with video input jack to watch images.", "Name": "Hiyadeal Super Mini Wired CMOS Camera Video Audio Security System IR Night Vision", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415odIF95xL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CV35ON2"}}
