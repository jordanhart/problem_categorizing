Only thing is I learned if you live in a area where you have alot of wild animals around it needs to be mounted above say where a racoon, possum or even a cat or dog can set it off... I am going to get a few more and put them in different areas  for extra safty, Plus it has a really good price and the alarm that goes off is loud enough to hear it though the whole house.....", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "FYI - I have over 20 of these - Excellent Units", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "R3RHON3LPF5VYE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just wanted to post a review/comment because I see people making reviews and comments that are rediculous. These units are an excellent low cost security motion sensor unit.I use these in the mountains and most are there 6 months out of the year and they endure all the weather the mountains can throw at them. To this day I have never had one gliche yet and some of mine are over 3 years old. Battery life with them is also excellent.You need to pay attention to the product information, the motion sensor is NOT water proof, they are weather resistant. that means DONT put them where they will get soaked or filled with rain or water....DUH...Also, people mention that it will continue to chime or alarm, the sensor has a wide angle fresnal lense, that means it will pick up motion in a very wide area horozontally and vertically. Also, they are heat sensitive, so if it is in direct sun light or where it will see moving shadows from the sun it will trigger the motion sensor. It will trigger from motion and heat, a small tree branch moving to a butterfly flying across in front of the sensor can and will trigger it.Here is a tip, you can cut down the amount of area the motion sensor picks up by just putting a couple small strips of masking tape vertically along the edges of the motion sensor fresnal lense, you can also do this across the top and bottom of the lense to narrow the detection field vertically. Simple thinking and it works like a charm.To water proof a sensor, use some silicone around the outside of the sensor casing along the seam, then put a small bead of silicone around the outside edge of the fresnal lense. this will help protect it even more from wet weather. The best way to protect it is to place it under an eave or under some sort of cover so it doesnt get soaked. very simple.These units also come in different channels, so you can get many units using the same frequency. Place one chime/reciever where you want to hear it and then place as many of the sensors outdoors as you want, you will have extra chimes/receivers but who cares, for the price you cant beat these units.For the record, I would not buy any other type, these have served me well over the years and I will continue to use them as long as they continue to make them. An excellent product and I recommend them to anyone that is on a budget for security or would just like a low cost peice of mind for around there home or business.Ya gotta be smarter than the box they come in.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "So Far So Good", "Author": "E. M. Johnson \"Occasional Reviewer\"", "ReviewID": "R2G6519QQS9QKN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE: This is the BEST INEXPENSIVE security device I have ever owned! It's now 8-25-12 and I have had two of these outside in the New England winter, spring, summer heat and pouring rain. If you have two sensors outside, either will sound both receivers- so it's hard to tell which area has movement. I don't see any way to get it to discriminate which zone is causing it to sound. This alarm works well and is well worth the $20 investment. There have been no failures of it working. It does pick up my next door neighbor pulling into his driveway about 50 feet away but that's ok. There have been a few instances when it went off repeatedly for no apparent reason. This seems to happen in full direct summer sun. But it does not happen consistently. There have been times I switched the receiver off (mowing the lawn and tripping it repeatedly annoys people indoors) and forgotten to turn it back on. So I recommend if you switch off the receiver, leave it on a counter top or somewhere you will see it and remember to switch it back on. So far I have not had to replace batteries either!A total two thumbs up.ORIGINAL REVIEWThey sell these locally at Harbor Freight stores, so if you live near one just drop in, they are $17.99 plus tax. I was having problems with my wireless doorbells working reliably so it occurred to me that one of these would cover both my front doors plus let me know when the mailman or UPS had been by. Also, from a security standpoint, hearing an alert when anyone was on the property approaching my front door was a big plus. For $20 I honestly didn't expect much.The sensor and receiver are nothing fancy but SURPRISE- they work perfectly! In fact, the sensor was TOO sensitive and was picking up cars going by in the street (about 20-25 feet away). I had to change the sensor position to facing across the property in front of the house instead of facing the street. So far it works flawlessly. It was been out in the bitter New England cold about a week. Give yourself a day or so to test it out before permanently fastening it in one location. That way you can be sure it is adequately covering the area you want it to without a lot of false alarms.I secured it to a railing on the front steps with two plastic locking cable ties. If you are worried about someone removing it, use a metal clamp from the plumbing section in Home Depot. It comes with two screws and a hole on the back of the sensor to mount it on a wall-- that didn't look very secure to me at all and it would be too easily removed. There is a small flashing red light on the front of the sensor that gos off when it \"sees\" you. If you like, cover it with tape to make it less visible especially at night). I bet you could hide one of these in a bird house or something like that if you really wanted to conceal it. It didn't try this though as its not necessary for me.The receiver is pretty loud on the high setting and can be heard through the house. It has a low and off setting too so you or whoever's in the house don't go insane if you are using a monitored area a lot for the day. (Just ask my teenager who was \"trying to sleep\" during my installation and testing phase on Saturday morning).I realize this unit is still new and has not been through any major rain or snow yet. I will return in a few months to update this review. I was happy enough to buy a second one to put on the back deck that has a glass sliding door. I read there is a way to get two sensors to sound on one receiver but I figure if I leave one set on high volume and the other on low volume, I will know which one is actually sensing something. I hope this helps you decide. Don't let the low price fool you, this thing really works!", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Driveway Alert", "Author": "Carlton O Phelps", "ReviewID": "R2BWNEZUXT0RD6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This driveway alert works great.

Cooper", "ReviewID": "R29UMS1V4YI0LR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this unit on October 11, 2012 from Homesafe. I mounted it outside, under the roof of a carport and facing my driveway. The range seems to be only about 30 feet, which is far less than what was advertised but works great for me because it didn't respond to traffic on my street beyond the end of my driveway. That kept false alarms to a minimum; they only occurred a few times over a 7-month period (using the alarm perhaps 10 hours per week on average) when deer or ground squirrels walked within range of the sensor.The alarm on the receiver is plenty loud when set to the High setting (I can actually hear it sound when I'm on a different floor in my two-story house). The 9-volt battery for the outdoor unit (the transmitter and motion sensor) lasted for four months before it needed replacing, great performance considering this spanned the autumn and winter months in Central Oregon (where it regularly gets down to the teens and twenties and can get down to below zero on occasion during the winter). This leads me to conclude that the system is very efficient in its power usage.Unfortunately, the system stopped working a few days ago. I replaced the three C batteries for the receiver and the 9-volt battery for the motion sensor/transmitter, but the alarm still doesn't sound when I walk directly in front of the sensor. The LED for the motion sensor still lights when it detects motion, and the alarm still sounds when I turn the receiver on, so the sensor and speaker are evidently still good. I suspect the receiver's chip has died.Aside from the premature failure, this is a good unit that I would recommend to anyone who needs a driveway alarm with very limited sensor range. Other reviewers have noted better range, so manufacturing tolerances are evidently at work here, and your mileage may vary.Postscript: I ordered a replacement system by the same name (\"Driveway Alert System\") from True Power. What I received was slightly different from what I\"d received before (same form factor, but different switch configuration), perhaps an updated version. It worked intermittently for 24 hours, after which time it consistently failed to work: The sensor's LED would light when a person or car crossed its beam path from only several feet away, but the alarm wouldn't sound even with the receiver only 40 feet away with a clear line of sight (no walls or windows obstructing the signal path) and no RF-producing equipment within at least 30 feet. To their credit, True Power sent a replacement without requiring me to return the defective unit.Postscript: The replacement system failed also. It worked twice, then consistently failed to trigger thereafter. I replaced batteries in both units, but that didn't help. Both sets of batteries for both sets of units -- transmitter and receiver --  were fresh/new EverReady Gold batteries with expiration dates in 2018. So I can categorically rule out that spent batteries are the problem. Also, once the system failed (after two successful alarms), it would not trigger no matter how close together I had the transmitter and receiver. Whether placed indoors or outdoors (far away from the house and from any potential RF; there is no above-ground telephone or electrical wiring on streets in my development), the two units would not trigger even when they were literally less than one foot away from each other and when walking directly in front of the sensor from less than two feet away (in all cases, the sensor's red LED would light, but the receiver wouldn't respond).Postscript 7/17/13: True Power refunded my money, including shipping, for the defective units. They maintained they could not get the returned units to fail in operation, so the units' failure on my end is a mystery (especially because I've since bought a different brand/model of driveway alarm, and it has consistently worked reliably from the start). True Power's customer service and communication were excellent.

At first, we had several false alarms because of one thing... the method they give you to mount the sensor/transmitter.  There is one key-hole mount located on the back/top of the sensor/transmitter that you are supposed to hang it from.  I suppose that may work for some locations but NOT where you have a chance of getting wind which causes the unit to move back and forth (even slightly).  This movement can cause it to think something is moving in front of it and it triggers.To solve the problem, at least for now, I pushed the unit between two vertical tree trunks.  This did not allow it to move and that's all it took.  Trigger accuracy improved significantly however, if you plan to face it toward bushes or other foliage, you may get false triggers on windy days,  I wish they had a sensitivity adjustment.As I mentioned tree or bush or even bird flight movement will set it off.  If the area you are monitoring has an abundance of these, you may get more false triggers than you want.  I accidentally spilled some parrot seeds/feed on my driveway and the birds, and this alarm, were very busy for awhile.I understand from other reviews that the Sun may cause false triggers so I faced ours North which will also save the sensor lens from UV deterioration over the years.I also previously purchased a car back-up camera from Amazon as well as a \"Fake\" security camera.  I installed the camera in the security camera enclosure, mounted  it on the garage and we tune our TV to this camera when this Driveway sensor alerts us.

From tests so far, the sensitivity is unaffected.  Several people have asked about finding additional transmitters.  I ended up with an extra transmitter on the wrong frequency.  I've have a good electrical background so I took the transmitter apart and compared the circuit boards for the one on the correct channel, and the one on the undesired frequency.  There are three very small loops of wire  next to an integrated circuit  on the right hand side of the board and the pattern of clipped loops and intact ones was different.  This combination  apparently determines the  transmitter's channel.  I clipped one loop and soldered another and now the channel of the extra transmitter is the same as the one I wanted to duplicate.  Don't  attempt this surgery if you aren't prepared to ruin the transmitter, or have no electronics experience.

If you're close enough to see the light you'd have to be stone cold deaf not to hear the tone when it's set to HI! It's loud - which is a good thing - so you'll hear it throughout the house and even in the LO setting it's fairly loud.  Installation was just a matter of inserting a 9 volt battery in the outdoor sensor unit and three C cells in the indoor unit (or use your own 6 volt AC adapter). The sensor can be mounted with a single screw wherever convenient, like under an eve. As described in the instructions, don't point the sensor at windows or other reflective surfaces as it will pick up the heat and trigger. In walk testing I found that the unit would \"see\" me about 20 feet away. The transmit range however, is far less than the 400 feet quoted if things like walls stand between the inside and outside of your home. With a few walls involved figure about 30 feet as more typical. However, as I mentioned earlier, the thing can be heard through the whole house so the range won't an issue unless you're planning on taking the receiver to the basement, backyard or out to the barn.

Like the reviewer says: \"..you just have to be smarter than the box it comes in..\"  You certainly can't place this near an area where there is a lot of movement, either from shrubs or weeds in the wind, or ordinary traffic.  I put mine in a plastic gallon milk jug with the side cut out, so it only detects the area right in front  - and set it too face in the direction I expect the night animals will approach.  No need to mount it permanently; I just move it around to find the right place to catch the villains. The alarm is just loud enough to awaken me, and I've seldom had false alerts. Much easier than trying to use a motion-detector video setup that has to be hooked up to the computer.
