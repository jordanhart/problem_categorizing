The software install and connections was straight forward and only took about 10-15 minutes but you can only adjust the brightness and contrast and no matter how you set them the picture quality is VERY poor. When you first see the picture of our driveway you think its a great picture but once you try to make out someone walking by or even read the license plate of a car 20 feet in front of the camera you realize just how poor the quality is. We had someone steal one of our solar landscape lights 20 feet in front of the camera and all I can tell you is that it was a white male. It could have been my brother and I there's no way I would have recognized him. Its that bad! Now for the lighting issue. During the day the cement street is just a bright glare and you can't make out anything. If you adjust the brightness for that the rest of the yard looks like dusk. At night the IR is very powerful. In fact its so powerful that when someone walks up looking straight at the camera they look like a glowing ghost except they are glowing so bright that you can't make them out. Again if you adjust the brightness down and bump the contrast up to compensate you can't see more than 30-40 feet away. We ended up comparing the video of my wife walking across our yard about 30 feet away from this camera with that from a $75 nanny cam from Target and the nanny cam looked 200% better. Better color, sharpness, better everything.

Spaulding", "ReviewID": "R294W8O75YPK7N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I want to monitor some of my property at night and after much searching it seemed Foscam was the most popular IR camera manufacturer.I suppose these cameras are the low end of Foscam's line-up at $95 each and they do now have an hd version but at a much higher price.My largest disappointment with the camera is the video quality, out of the box the focus is almost unbearable. I contacted Foscam technical support about the focus, I have a lot of trouble understanding people with a strong accent so I started emailing them and they said there is no focus adjustment for this model. Well, after clicking through their website I found the focusing procedure which involves simply removing the lens cover, light board and rotating the lens. That helped but there is no way to get a real clear focus you just have to live with sub-par videos.I must comment a bit more about the technical support. I asked them a couple of questions about the video quality and it always came back to there must be something wrong with MY network or MY PC setup. I even connected the camera by a direct Ethernet wired connection through which I get Gigabit communication between the PC's in my house with no change in video quality. I have 2 of these cameras and they both are exactly the same. The video is not focused and is very pixelated, so bad I can't even recognize someone I know at 60' daytime much less at night.Like I said, $95 is a relatively inexpensive camera and maybe I'm expecting too much but the technical support is important to me, especially in this situation because I'm new to this and I did not have a very good experience. On the positive side, the cameras are solid, feel well built. They are easy to configure to the pc, they even have WPS capability, upgradeable firmware etc..Like I said the price of the cameras is to be considered, you get what you pay for and if the technical support had been acceptable I probably would have bought some of their upper grade models but I am probably going to look elsewhere next timeThanks,Mike", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera does a good job, functions well", "Author": "Michael Laferriere", "ReviewID": "RJTKF74Y9VK6W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have one of these cameras attached to a tree outside of my house. Even the 6mm lens does seem slightly long if you plan on using it close up. This camera would seem better suited to be mounted on a second floor eave or set back from the area you wish to view. This would also help keep it vandal proof.The 8905 seems to have an excellent wifi chip built in. Using the stock antenna it can pick up numerous wifi networks that even my strategically placed router (with 9db antennas) is not able to see. I have never had a dropped signal and it works fine at the other end of the house.I have an older WRT54GS router running dd-wrt (an EXCELLENT firmware upgrade for Linsksys/Ciso & other routers) which handles the camera perfectly. The pnp opens up a port from the outside as needed and using the DDNS I can connect from a device outside my network with ease.I believe Foscam has begun using inhouse coders to generate firmware. The 8910 and 8905's use a very stable and functional firmware which they contract out. There have been issues with Foscam.com and Foscam.us having separate versions. This contracted firmware has all the features you will likely need. These include using an NTP (to set the camera's time), remote FTP (to save pictures remotely in case your camera walks off), and of course the ability to view live over the Internet. One small bug note, the NTP servers do not seem to handle Daylight savings time very well. You may have to either sync to PC (likely the time will wind up being way off within a day or two) or you can use the advance time by 60 minutes to correct this.The Foscam cameras allow you to create eight separate user logins with three levels of access. Visitors can sign in to the camera and watch whatever it is pointed at, operators, can sign in & watch while administrators can get in and alter settings remotely.The alarm settings are a bit on the primitive side. You have options to either trigger an alarm based on motion sensitivity. They have a setting for \"motion compensation\" but this doesn't seem to do too much. If you had the ability to pick parts of the screen to watch and ignore others, it would be far better. IE, if you are watching your driveway and the road behind it is in view, you might have to put up with false alarms every time a car drives down your street.  You also have the ability to set alarms on your own time & day schedule.The setup was not too bad at all, being a guy I skipped the directions and plugged an Ethernet cable directly between the camera and my router. Once I found the camera's IP address I was able to connect to it. Foscam provides a utility to do this which would have saved me a few minutes time as I went to my router to see what IP it gave the camera. Using the Foscam \"IP Camera Tool\" it will bring up a list of camera's on your local network.  Once you see your new camera you can merely double click on it and it will open a browser window to your camera. It will handle the port (defaults to the generic port 80) numbers for you. This way you can cut & paste your wifi password into the camera and then setup your security, change your passwords etc. and your good to go!I had to send my original 8905 back as it was stuck in day mode. Others have had these cameras stuck in the night mode all day. If it stays in the night mode, the colors will be mostly grey and the image will be partially washed out. If it is stuck in the day mode, you will not see anything at night. The camera uses a small relay which seems to stick sometimes. Sometimes you can get it functioning again by shining a bright light in it at night. If you hear the click-click, it will be functioning, if it is sticking, it will be silent or very muffled. Since I ordered mine on Amazon instead of directly through Foscam, I was able to get Amazon to replace it. Foscam seems aware of the issue, but since this is a hardware issue, there is very little that will likely change with firmware alone. This is why I held back one star on this review.All in all, a very good camera especially when you consider that some camera's with the same functions will cost many times what this little gem costs.", "Date": "May 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "No reply after starting RMA", "Author": "Andrew \"Andrew\"", "ReviewID": "R29M8SP7TSHA9Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I thought this is a good product based on review ranking, until i work with their customer service.My outdoor camera stop working somehow, i figure out its wifi part not working.

I'd purchased the Foscam FI8910W and was impressed by it, so I gave this one a shot.  Installation was easy and the instructions straight forward.  Here are my impressions of the camera:Construction was very solid with an aluminum shell and separate shield over the top.  Felt very sturdy.  Was much larger than I expected.The mounting bracket is flimsy and should be replaced by a better quality one.The Ethernet connector on the end of the power cable was huge.  I had to drill a 1-inch hole to feed it through the wall.I purchased the optional power cable extender.  That worked well.The biggest problem with the camera is the view angle.  Once I had the camera setup and mounted, I was shocked at how useless the view was.  It was way too narrow and could only show a small part of my driveway.  For surveillance purposes, it was a bust.  I went ahead and purchased a 3rd party wide angle lens to see if that improves it.  But, this was not want I was expecting for an outdoor surveillance camera.  About all it is useful for, out of the box, is maybe for monitoring an entryway.  This last problem is why I gave this product only 3 stars instead of 5.

We've been testing and installing these over the last 10 days or so and have 4 up and functioning, 3 of them working fine. The problems on the ones we returned were right out of the box and have been various to the infra red feature not working, broken antennae, and pan not working.Now we have the technical/software problem that the cameras will flicker (the picture rapidly changes contrast) resulting in dozens of false motion alert emails sent. I learned through the Internet that one possible solution is to change the resolution settings from 640 to 320 and this seems to work. Unfortunately the cameras revert back to the 640 setting on their own. All attempts to reach Foscam fail. The telephone says \"all circuits are busy\" whenever I call, the chat offered on their website while it offers help when you submit a request an auto-responder replies \"how may I help you?' but no one is there.The cameras are pretty cool and when they work it really solves an issue for us.

I have only used it locally and have not tried to access it from a public location.  The wireless connection is good.  The picture is adequate considering the price.  The IR lighting is better than I expected. The mount, however, is not too good.  It limits the direction you can point the camera: if you try to mount it to a surface and point it in a direction that is not parallel or perpendicular, you will have problems.  One of the plastic caps on the gimble screw (to tighten the camera in the desired direction) has already broken from trying to tighten it enough to keep the camera from falling down under its own weight.  Obviously I'll have to make my own mount for a long term placement.  If you intend to move the camera several times while deciding on the ideal location, you can probably expect the mount to fail in some manner.The alarm function from movement in the camera field of view is minimal.  There is no ability to section off areas within the field of view. Also when it rained, the camera constantly alarmed.  If you set the sensitivity very low to stop the alarms, then you have to reset it after the rain stops.  I hadn't really thought about this, or expected it and I don't know if any camera software can take that into account to avoid constant adjustments.A robust mount and the ability to mark a section or sections of the camera field of view for alarms would have made this review a 5 instead of a 3 ... considering the low camera price.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hours to configure and still not working?", "Author": "Greg", "ReviewID": "R1T1Y9FS5NQNUU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ok, I bought this as what I thought was a relatively inexpensive, but solid solution for home security.  When I received it I decided to hook it up as wired on my desk at home with the expectation that once the kinks were worked out and I better understood the product I could remotely mount it in a wireless configuration.So it is now hardwired on my desktop and I find that it quits responding to the UI at times.  I can then attempt hard \"reboots\" of the camera (toggle power).  The bottom line is that the UI response is glitchy and at times goes away without letting you know whether your device configuration changes actually were saved.So getting past this obstacle, I got some configuration setting in and thought I would test it using an alarm to notify my gmail account. Ok, I enter configuration parameters for gmail (and the associated alarm settings) and press test (oh, but wait, you aren't supposed to press test unless you have saved the configuration settings first.

It's nearly impossible to tighten the mount enough to keep the camera from moving without stripping the threads.  Electrically the power, LAN and reset button are all wired into the same cable.  In addition, power is provided by an in-door wall transformer.  So you need a waterproof AC outlet AND someway to stow the exposed reset switch and LAN jack.  To date, I have not been able to find any type of reasonably sized electrical box that will work.  I may have to resort to one box to stow the cables next to an electrical outlet with an in-use type cover.  Also, the cable comes of the wall tranformer at the wrong angle and will require a dual-gang box for a single plug.  Completely unsightly and unacceptable.  Buyer beware.The software does not maintain users settings and must be reset everytime you open a browser session.  For example, I have multiple cameras, but everytime I open the browser it defaults to single camera view.  I also then have to re-establish settings for on-screen clock, border, etc.  The worst part is the software default is also camera NOT recording.  There also is no provision for recording to your PC's hard drive without opening a browser session.  So if your browser isn't running, you can't record to your PC.With some tweaks, this could be a great product, but the issues too many and too wide-ranging: software, hardware and electrical.  The camera does have a good picture, so if you just want a toy it's definitely fun to play with, but if you want a real maintenance free security system where you don't have to constantly go out and readjust the cameras, clean and seal connectors, and you want to actually capture a recording when something happens - this ain't it...I'm in too deep to start over, but if you're starting from scratch, think twice.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best IP cam for the price", "Author": "Tman", "ReviewID": "R6Y6WBLVWE7SB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "given the price, this cam serves well under a myriad of conditions.

It took a little forum surfing. I never bothered with the provided software because I bought this camera for use with zoneminder. First thing to do is connect it with an ethernet cable. Check your router to see what IP address your DHCP server (typically a router function) gave to the camera. Go to that address in your PC browser. Login to the camera with push mode (not ActiveX). Login with userid admin (no password).Assuming you want to run this thing wirelessly, go to the wireless lan setting section and scan twice (yes twice) for available networks. When you see yours, click on it to auto-fill the fields. Type in your key and click submit. While the camera is resetting, unplug the ethernet cable from the camera. Roughly 30 seconds later, the camera will have requested and received a new (and different) IP address from your router/DHCP-sever. Find that new address from your router interface and go to it in your browser to make sure it works. Now you can (finally) reserve that IP address in your router DHCP section so that whenever the camera (after being power cycled) requests a new IP address, the router will always give it the same one (based on the mac address). You can only do that AFTER you switch to wireless mode. If you do it before (while you are hard-wired), you will never get wireless to work. You will want to \"DHCP-reserve\" the IP address so that you can port-forward to it from the outside. Otherwise the camera IP address might move on you if you take a power hit (making port-forwarding dicey).As far as image goes, it's great - both daytime and nightime. (Much better than the D-Link DCS-930L simply because of better optics - The DCS-930L is indoor only and is much smaller though). The image is fixed and a bit zoomed, but that might be perfect for your application. You can replace the lens (saw it done in a youtube video) if you want a more fisheye effect. As I mentioned above, I have no idea how good the supplied software is since I don't use it. Zoneminder does all my motion detection and notification for me.If you're serious about monitoring, you should get a couple of UPSs to keep your PC and cameras running in case of power glitches.

Eg.  the device defaults to 60 hz. and if that sounds good to you, don't set up the camera to work in sunlight.  It will be very overexposed and can't be corrected.  The manual doesn't cover this, but there is a \"daylight setting\" which takes care of the problem.  And, there is no discussion in the manual of how to record the video of where the software puts the recording.  All of this, which should be covered in the manual, is doable.

That is all your going to get though, just a little area, there is no zoom or wide angle on this. Quality is pretty good, I am impressed on that aspect, disappointed in the lack of wide angle. The huge blow that if I could return it, I would aspect: The camera keeps changing IP address' so the port forwarding to view the camera on my phone or any computer away from home keeps failing. I have not figured out why, I have multiple cameras and only this camera keeps doing it. I have to update the IP address in my router settings at least twice a week. So this camera does not work the way I need it too, but may work for you if you dont need to view it away from home. So I would personally return this item and shop for a different one. I do have other cameras of this Brand \"Foscam\" and like i said before those work fine like it should.Updated 8/25/13: I was able to change the settings for the camera to stop changing IP. It was not in a place I would have looked at. So I have since changed my review rating. I am happy with the camera, only disappointment is the lack of wide angle. I can no view this camera on my phone and tablet without a problem. I have noticed another problem. When it sends the alarm email with the picture it took, it has the wrong date in the email.

Hales \"brewmaster1957\"", "ReviewID": "RDDAQ0G6RSCW7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "FOSCAM has discontinued this model, but I can tell you from experience that the QC at Foscam is non-existent.  The cameras have a very high failure rate and tend to go out about 4-6 months after purchase.  The most common event I have seen is that the camera can not be accessed with IP Camera Tool.  Without this tool, the camera is useless.  The chip inside the camera is not working correctly and this causes failure.  I have now gone through 3 cameras.  Now, let me tell you about FOSCAM's sneaky trick of not really covering you on the warranty.  After 30 days, you can NOT get a refund, no matter what.  However, you can send the camera back for a replacement that is a refurbished and defective model.  This costs about $20 using UPS and standard delivery.  Foscam then charges ANOTHER $10 to send a camera back to you that is probably going to fail again.Since I am on my third camera, my shipping costs now exceed $80 for defective cameras.  This is about the price of a new one.  The fine print of the \"Warranty\" does state that you have to pay $10 after a 30 day period.  I guess they have to make money somehow because if they didn't charge a fee, I am sure they would go bankrupt just from shipping new (Used and refurbished and defective) models back to you.I think the best thing is to stay away.  If you MUST have a FOSCAM, go to a local store like Wurst-Buy or Fall-Mart.  At least you can save shipping. Oh, be sure to buy extended protection because you WILL make your money back.Foscam is a lousy producer of crap Chinese (is there any other kind) cameras.  Your odds are VERY high you will experience a defective camera sometime in the next 5-12 months after purchase.Don't buy this product and do some shopping for a better camera with REAL warranty protection.", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera at a good price", "Author": "Timothy R.

I've have  a couple Trendnet cams and some inexpensive Swann cams and this camera has the best image capabilities by far.  True the camera is larger then most but it has a pile of leds that shine out to nearly 100 feet at night.  One drawback is there is no way to manually turn them off at night if your situation would warrant it. They are automatically controlled by a photo cell ONLY.  Oh - btw the included camera mount is somewhat under designed for the size of this camera. I had to beef it up to securely hold the camera.  Wireless capabilities seem quite adequate - for me it was a very easy to set up but I have quite a bit of experience with wireless networks.  I broke down and bought Blue  Iris software (sold by Foscam) to control all my cameras.  If you have 3 or more cameras - especially if they are of different brands/etc you might want to consider this software.  Pretty fancy program - but there is a learning curve with it and of course you will need to leave one of your computers on all the time to run the program in the background.

Excellent Excellent zero light illumination. I  purchased this to view my snowmobiles so they dont get stolen again. The camera software to setup email alerts with snapshots on motion seems a little finicky, but that may just be me finding the right \"sweet\" spot. (256 motion alerts in 6 hours) a bit too sensitive yet! But I love that it can do it. Gmail can be used for the email account, but It seems very picky, but that appears to be gmail not the camera.I will say the mount that comes in the box seems like its too light weight to properly handle this camera. The camera keeps wanting to slowly drift downward even after tightening with pliers.Image quality is amazing for the  price. I have another foscam camera that I love, but it's quality is half of this one. I will be putting up more of this model, and eventually replacing the other one with another one of this model.I'd recommend a heavier duty mount be purchased.

The update process was flawless (make sure to do it from a wired connection). The configuration process was relatively easy as well. The \"IP Camera Tool\" software (included with the camera) used to locate the camera(s) on the network works very well and web browser interaction (SeaMonkey, Firefox, and Internet Explorer) worked equally as well (both wired and wireless).The Foscam forums have a wealth of helpful information. I especially appreciated the topic(s) discussing how to disable the embedded My.Foscam.org DDNS setting in the firmware configuration. This is otherwise not configurable through the normal user interface (UI). Really, must this be a default with the inability to simply disable it? The not-so-savvy users could open the cam for full viewing by the general public if they are not careful. Read more about this in the post at: [...]Update: Amazon will not post the link, so just go to the Foscam forum and search for \"Security Concern with MyFoscam.org\".As for the image quality, the clearest can be acquired at 320x240 (rather small). The only other option is 640x480 which is a bit grainy. Static images are easily recognizable, even at night with the infra-red LEDs lighting the scene. However, motion video at either of these resolutions leaves a lot to be desired. Motion is very blurry and infrequently identifiable. In my experience with these cameras and other multiple Foscam's I bought here (FI8910W and FI8905W), I found this to be the case with video and snapshot stills when motion is in the scene. Basically, if you know who/what it is, then you can probably identify it, but good luck with an unexpected/uninvited guest. I believe this to be an inherent weakness in the camera design and a detriment when using these for home surveillance.Another note on the infra-red LEDs: they emit a red glow in the dark or low-light environments. Therefore, they are not really suited for concealment and can easily be spotted.  They also have other bright power and network activity LEDs on them as well.  While the network LED can be shut off in the software, the power LED cannot. With these on the front they happily announce their presence to any would-be intruder (day or night - which I realize is moot given the aforementioned red-glow).As for the other CMS (Central Management Software) software included with the camera(s), it does work but it is not without its own quirks. -- For one thing, CMS *MUST* be run with *Administrator* privileges in Windows (I use Win7 Pro). Otherwise, it cannot be properly configured for use with the cameras. So, right-mouse-click the icon and select \"Run as administrator\". This is a software design flaw which could have been overcome by incorporating other methods. -- Once configured, I found CMS to be clunky and sluggish when controlling cameras. I had eight of them setup and it was painful to remotely operate them. With two or three configured it was more manageable. And I am running this on a very powerful Intel-based core-i7 PC at 3.5GHz!In the end, I am disappointed with my investment and may opt to return/replace these cameras.", "Date": "February 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice wireless camera!

The camera is easy to install, set up, and mount.Notes:The camera is better for longer distances, hallways, yards, and distances more than 10 feet. It is clearer than the 4W and I recommend getting the 4W for front door cams and this one for larger areas.Set Up:Plug the Ethernet cord in to install the camera after installing the software. Do the complete set up with it plugged in and you'll have quicker results. This camera, my second, took less than five minutes to set up on my network. Make sure to change the port to 8090, 8091, and so on for better access on your network. You may notice, especially if you have Comcast your ISP will change all connected devices IP addresses randomly, disconnecting your camera from your tablet and phones. To fix this, log on to your routers by typing in the URL on the router manual and change the internet signal to \"Static\", this will prevent IP addresses from changing.  Oh, be sure to waterproof all cords by taping with electrical tape prior to installing and enjoy.I plan on purchasing at least two more cameras.

I highly recommend these cameras for the following reasons:1. Infrared technology: Ensures great resolution in complete darkness.2. Free tech support3. App stores sell a cellphone app for $1.99 that links to your camera system in real-time for ultimate peace of mind.4. Mail service settings on your router are easily configured so that your email will be pinged if motion is detected from your cameras and photos are automatically taken and sent to your email. The alarm service settings will be set up as part of the free technical support that you receive with the cameras.5. Cameras have audio, pan and tilt features that can be remotely accessed and changed through the $1.99 app. It can even work as a crude international telephone (audio is sub-optimal but hey, it's free).6. Tech support has always been able to resolve my issues.I set up lithium battery backup so, should the thief cut the power supply, these cameras will still work. Basically, I have a superb alarm system that I do not have to pay a monthly fee. Also, the security companies tend to take several minutes to call the police in the event of a break in. When you get the email, you know and can call it yourself immediately. So, in my estimation, it is cheaper AND better.There are a couple of downsides but they're not insuperable:1. You need to be patient and have enough time when you call tech support. They can take a while to answer the phone. You can call sales and request that they call tech support and they will call you back but the call back can take some time, too.2. You CANNOT set up an email address with free email services (yahoo, gmail, etc) just for the cameras because it will recognize the emails as spam if you get too many motion detection emails per day.

I use this to monitor people approaching my front door, which is about 35 feet away from the camera. I plan on changing the lens to a 12 mm lens, which is still enroute.The camera does a great job in daylight, and a passable job at night. I have it set to send me an email with photos and to upload the photos to my FTP site when there is an alert. It is very cool. I do get a few false alarms, I think it is from the light being switched on or off.Downside: the setup often requires a camera reboot after a change to the configuration.  So, \"change a setting, wait a minute for a reboot, log back in, and repeat ten times.\"  Also, the alert scheduler could be a little easier to work with... but this is an improvement over the previous Foscam cameras I have.But the picture is good and clear.Warning on setup, if you don't know what an IP DMZ is on a router, this is going to be a difficult setup. I'm just warning you on this. Get your techno-weenie network admin friend to come help you set this up. It will save you from entering a 1 star review.  If you can't assemble a IP network, you will spend  hours trying to figure this out. This was my third camera.

Sandra Williams took me through the settings and failing to find an obvious error there she had me reset the camera to the factory settings.  Then we went through the setup again with the same results.  Then she escalated the call and got her senior tech involved.  In the end the problem appeared to be the encoding of the password for My WiFi network.  The Password stored in the camera needs to be explicitly set to ASCII or HEXADECIMAL (a pull down setting in the camera) and even though all of the other settings where correct the WiFi Network Password was not being sent and received correctly so the camera worked fine with the Ethernet cable connected but couldn't connect to the wireless LAN.

I use all Apple products so it was a little different than what Windows users would find. It is important to remember that once you do the setup while connected via CAT5/6 cable and are configuring the wireless side of the camera, that once you disconnect the CAT5/6 cable and let the camera reboot, you need to remember the IP address is going to change so you will need to look once again at your router to get the new IP address.I've looked over almost every single review and it seems to me that is the spot that gets everyone, Foscam cannot really do much about thatAlso, my frame rates seems a bit low if I look at the numbers, but you need to remember that different software will report the frame rates differently. The included web server, when viewed with Firefox/Safari does not display the rate, looking at it in Internet Explorer does display it rather high actually, then look at it in Zoneminder and it is much low, even leaving IE open. I've had 4 different software programs running all displaying widely varying frame rates so take them with a grain of saltIn the end, the video should not be choppy if there is only one connection to the camera, keep adding connections, all at the same time, then the rates will suffer.I do not need HD video for the areas I am using this camera, where I do need HD, I have a camera that can handle that. For the cost of this camera, the video is probably a little better than you would expect, Daytime is quite clear, Night time is fine but do not expect to make out detailed facial features unless they are very close to the cameraAll in all, if you buy this camera and use it in a manner that it is capable of handling, then you will not be disappointed, if you want to read license plates at 100 feet in all conditions, you need to spend about 5 times me to get that kind of resolution", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Foscam  F l8905W", "Author": "G", "ReviewID": "R1HUYJP4B78LG1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Works as advertised less that 20 minutes to setup good picture quality.

Yeager", "ReviewID": "R14CMS66F8C0BE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I wanted to go wireless as my old Lorex system is really short on applications and is really limited in what you can do with it. So I purchased the F18905W to test it out. Set up was really easy, however the software that came with the camera is very poor. I purchased Blue Iris which is a really great software package with a lot of applications you can use. I highly recommend that anyone wanting to go wireless with their computer, get the Blue Iris software. It's worth it. Now about the Foscam camera. It has a very poor angle of sensing. Only 22 degrees, but the distance is great. I have it mounted on my front porch to view the walk to the front door and it does a very good job but wish I had a wider angle of view. When using it wireless, the frame rate varies allot and play back of the video is somewhat jerky. The camera mount is rather cheap and the thumb nuts will break easy. I drilled out the holes and bought regulat machine screws which made the mount better. I did notice that during a power failure, intermittent one, that I had to take down the camera and connect it to my PC via a CAT5 to reset up the parameters. The cameras IP address changed??? So if you are going to use this camera in a wireless mode, you better have a long CAT5 cable just in case. Sure beats taking down the camera to redo everything. All in all, the camera is what they stated it to be. It is very good with excellent night vision. Would I purchase another F18905W? NO because of the angle of view only.", "Date": "October 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Foscam Product and Support", "Author": "Joel M.

Both daytime and night time picture quality is very good.  The field of view with the 6mm lens is a bit narrow, so I wouldn't recommend the camera if you intend on setting up the camera close to the area you intend on monitoring, but in my case I wanted to set up the camera to watch 2 outdoor sheds that were 60 feet away and the camera/lens gives me a nice, clear picture of both sheds.  The only reason I gave the camera 4 stars instead of 5 has to do with the motion detector alarm on the camera.  The motion detection does work and it will send you an email notification along with several snapshot pictures once triggered, but the detector is very finicky and it gives off a lot of false activations no matter how much I try to fine tune the sensitivity settings.  I can't seem to find the perfect sensitivity setting no matter what I do.  One of the biggest problems is that any kind of change in lighting conditions will set off the motion alarm.  large clouds passing in front of the sun, swaying tree limbs changing the shadow pattern in the yard,, will result in a barrage of false activations.  This is the only flaw I can find with this camera but I'm still happy with the camera.  I'm still experimenting with the motion alarm settings and hopefully will find a compatible setting to give me the least amount of false activations, but even if I don't I will only use the alarm when I'm away from home anyway so I'll just anticipate a lot of false activation emails and will simply discard them from my email mailbox.  For the money I think the camera give you a good bang for your buck, however if the alarm feature working perfectly is very high on your list of expectations then I would suggest looking at a different brand of camera.", "Date": "August 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Foscam Camera", "Author": "tonijo", "ReviewID": "RFL87UQUMRNY2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My foscam camera works great and talk to Ralph in customer support work with me on the phone and stayed until all my issues where resolved.

Usually deer, but possoms's squirls, cats, all critters and people also like the gas or electric meter people.I was skeptical at first, with only reviews and not many picts to see what the view from the camera would be for my particular application. I don't want to let my dog out at night if deer are in the yard that \"I\" couldn't see. Rather not have my dog get kicked in the head by chasing them. The deer populate in my yard because I have over 30 fruit trees on my land. The deer eat the fruit that is on the ground, mostly apple trees. I can now see to the very back of my country yard and see if any critters are out there.The camera works great because it was built as a camera. BUT... it needs to be connected to your home network for you to reap the benefits of this cam or any IP cam for that matter. If you don't know how to setup your network, ask a friend, or call you internet provider, or foscam. Too many reviews I seen were based on they can't see anything and it didn't work. That is because it needs to be set up on your home network, and the camera is just that... a camera. But in order to view the camera, needs to be set up properly for your home wired or wifi network. I did have to turn the lens for better focus as shipped from the factory, but that is typical. I like the focus of my cams my way which made it even better to be able to adjust it.I use LiveCams Pro on my iPhone and couldn't ask for a better/cheaper system for the money, app, and camera.Just need how to figure out how to add pict. I didn't have a pict so was hard for me to make decision, but i'm glad I got this cam.UPDATED... not the best quality macbook screen recording of desktop from cam compared to real view especially after uploading and recorded vid artifacts, but you can see my german shepherd... he takes off after something, then you see his eyes, then he heads towards the back door. I dig this cam and will get another!", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "good camera, flimsy mount", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3EOOKQ4A6TVVL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this camera for Christmas.  It is a great camera, and I put a pan head motor on it, so I can see my entire yard with it. However, I had to improve the mounting hardware for it from the local hardware store, as the mounting plate that came with the camera was made of lightweight tin, and it stripped out the first time I tried to tighten it down.  The bracket could also be a bit longer, as it is not long enough to mount it on a wall and tilt the camera up.  So the review is because of the mounting hardware, not the camera.  I bought more sturdy mounting hardware for under $5, so it was more of an inconvenience than anything.

Follow The Instructions.", "Author": "Ryan Cawdor \"Scarecrow\"", "ReviewID": "R14IVZDVUU6F1C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After reading all the reviews of this camera I decided to post my own thoughts.  The camera itself is physically sturdy and has good daytime viewing.  Night viewing is good but obviously not as good as daytime since the camera relies on an external light source or/and the built in Infrared lights. The mount that comes with the camera is basically junk and should be discarded.  I bought a different mount for it after I realized that the mount that comes with it doesn't hold the camera position well.  The camera will move around especially if it is not \"hanging\" down but instead is mounted on a vertical wall.  Back to the viewing capability: The \"range\" on the camera for night viewing is good and I can see my neighbors across the street.  Facial features at more than 60 feet or so are not really discernible, especially at night.  No audio on this camera and you cannot turn off the Infrared lights which glow and are easily seen at night.  Make sure you mount the camera out of reach.The biggest complaint I see on the reviews are the problems people are running into when setting up the camera for wireless use.  I am no computer guru and only follow instructions and I had this camera up and running wireless in 15 minutes total time.  It's really simple folks: Plug the LAN cable (provided) from the camera to the router, plug in power supply for the camera, access the camera with a browser (I used Firefox) IAW the instructions and then set it up on the Administrator screen.  Don't forget to assign a password to the Admin account, especially if you intend to use it wireless.  Go through the Administrator screen and find the section to \"Use Wireless\" and check that box.  Once you click on \"submit\" it will reboot the camera.  After about 10 seconds into the reboot all you have to do is UNPLUG the LAN cable from the camera.  Once a minute or so goes by run the IP Camera program and your wireless camera should be visible in the box.  Click on it and open Internet Explorer (Not Firefox) and log in to the camera.  Now you can play with all the features and learn the software and how the camera works.  Setup your \"record\" path if you intend to record.Once you get more cameras you can add them to this camera and actually have up to 9 cameras running simultaneously....recording if you wish.  I have two Foscam 8918W cameras running with my outdoor camera with audio and video being recorded simultaneously for all three (no audio on the outdoor camera).  About 39 minutes of time is roughly 850 meg of disk space for EACH camera.  Not a big deal if you have a large hard drive and delete the files after a couple of days.Overall I think this is the best camera for the buck!Updated 29MAY2013: This camera has been on since October of 2011 with zero problems!  I cannot complain it is worth every dime!  To me it was very easy to setup and very easy to use with the software provided by the company.  Great buy!

I will say that I am an computer consultant so I'm sure that plays a role as to why this was so easy for me to setup because I do a lot of these things on a normal basis anyway.  That said, I still think it's fairly simple if you just follow the directions.You plug it in with the RJ45 cable (cat5) and power it on, you install the camera ip tool and it finds the camera on the network for you, you then put that ip address into your browser of choice and then login.  From there it's just customizing it how you want.  I set it up with wireless and it sits roughly 60 feet away from my router.  The picture is near real time (30 fps) very surprised on the quality and speed of the video.  One thing to watch out for is you may not pick up the camera with your wireless router if you have a wireless G or N router.  It seems to operate on wireless B (has a further distance but not as fast as G) I just went into the wireless settings on my router and told it to use mixed mode or B&G; mode.I have it setup with motion detection and to email me with pictures, which works very well.

This can be changed by changing out the lens with a 6mm (42\u00b0) one.  You will need to order it from Foscam for 19.95.  I would suggest doing a youtube search on replacing the lens, so you know what to expect. - Unlike the other Foscam cameras this is a fixed camera.  I knew this when I bought it, and did not think much of it until dealing with the limited field of view.  They need an outdoor version with motion control. - Extra Cords hanging off the back of the camera.  You will have a Ethernet port and a reset switch hanging off the back of the camera.

The DLink is a very easy router to use, it has a setup wizard which virtually does all the hard parts for you.  When you install the camera, the first thing you should do is use the little cd that comes with it -- it has a quick start guide that you can pop up, which makes installation a lot more easy than trying to read the tiny instructions in the miniature manual that comes with it (I need reading glasses to read it).  I followed the quick start guide directions exactly, and had the camera set up and working in less than 15 minutes, a LOT less time than I had anticipated!  The software that comes with the program makes it easy to adjust the camera to any settings you wish.  We bought ours in order to keep an eye on an owl box that my husband put up last summer -- it is being checked out by a potential tenant and we have been asked by the State DEP to keep an eye on things and report to them what happens.

Not a good feature for a security camera either.Pros:* well built, video quality is OKI use this camera with a Synology DS server and they pair well. You have to assign a static IP, otherwise you loose the camera if you reboot or loose power. To setup initially, you need to connect with a patch cable and then do the wireless setup.Unfortunately, I missed the return window, otherwise it would have been a return.

From my subjective view, on my system, it wasn't fit for purpose.In the ideal location, the signal was non-existent, and it was impossible to get a picture.  This contrasted with the Foscam M105l, which provided an almost adequate signal - but that had to be sent back, for other reasons.As a test, the F18905W was moved closer to the modem.  There was a signal, but the frame rate was poor, and when I did a constant ping (Windows 7 Command Prompt) the ping time seemed very varied, but overall was slow.  There were bursts of high speed pings - eg 7 ms - but the average was in the region of 500ms, and figures of over 1500ms were not unusual.  As for frame rate, one piece of software showed around 10 fps soon after I first plugged it in, but quickly moved down to 1 or 2 fps or even less.What do we conclude?  It is possible that the wireless modem I'm using is poor.  However my wireless laptop was working fine in the place where I was testing the camera.  Yet I concede that many people's systems have no problems with the camera - as the good reviews show.I have been using Amazon for over 12 years, and this is the second time I have returned a product because it didn't work as I expected it to.  The first time was about a week ago, with the Foscam M105l.  If you need an IP camera, that's going to be any distance from your modem, it's probably best to play safe and go for a wired solution.", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Technical support", "Author": "Mary Jacobs", "ReviewID": "RJ38E188KNOMC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Kate was very thorough, courteous and friendly.

Well protected in it's foam enclosure, all the parts present and a manual to boot.  After carefully taking all of it out and familiarizing myself with the install process, I proceeded to connect the ethernet cable to my router, and plugged in the power supply, looking for the tell tale green flashing light on the enormous ethernet plug that is permanently attached to the camera and sprouts both the reset button on a seperate lead as well as the power cord lead.  How anybody is supposed to get that through the wall in a convenient manner is a mistery.  But with a hole big enough, I guess I could drive it through in the back of my pick-up. Ridiculous.The camera housing itself seems to be made of aluminum and feels sturdy enough.  A beefy weight, it seems hardly likely that the mount supplied with this camera will be able to hold it up on a nice day, let alone on a windy day.  Flimsy is the nicest description I can offer.  The camera sports an impressive array of IR leds. The antenna was easy to attach at the rear of the housing, but is the 3 Db version and we all know how that performs on the other cameras.Once the moment arrived where I could \"fire\" the camera up and evaluate it's performance.........DOA  =  DEAD ON ARRIVAL!!!!!!!!Tried another Foscam power supply from similar camera.  Nada.Did not bother with Foscam tech support, as my experience with them for the indoor PTZ camera was bad enough already.  Thankfully I purchased the camera through a major vendor and returned it for a full refund.  The PTZ accompanied it's junky brother to the store.My recommendation....

I had a hard time setting it up so I called their tech support. I spoke to an individual with an Indian accent. I was told they must take remote access of my computer via software (they told me where to download it) to set up my camera. I questioned the tech if it was possible to guide me through the process without giving control of my comp, he said NO! He made the camera work. Now, I scan my computer almost every day for viruses....and have not had an issue for a long, long time (as in a year or so before my antivirus software found something). Low and behold I find trojans on my computer after he took control of my comp to set up the camera!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  AVG and Malware both quarantine these trojans but I scan my system again to find them back!!!!!!  I call up comcast they told me that I am basically on my own. I call up Amazon and explain the situation the rep was concerned and nice as can be but again she told me to post this review for others to see and they would take back the camera.Also, when the foscam tech support rep set up this camera he had complete access to my wifi password, name of my network and my ip address so essentially they have all of your info at their hands. They can hack in and out of your system!Now, I logged into my email, bank account and checked my credit report via a credit monitoring service I subscribe to before I scanned and found all of these trojans. I might be screwed and am worried someone has stolen my info.I implore all to becareful.Update: I have spent many hours and money (over 100.00 I should have never spent) on this issue. I had to switch out my modem with comcast so I could get a new ip address and I had to replace my computers hard drive and re-install all software. Also, I placed a fraud alert on my credit report, so I can be notified if someone tries to get credit under my name and changed the password on my email and all other accounts. Now I am not certain if I dealt with a sinister tech rep or it is a systematic problem. I would avoid the product but if you do purchase it ask for a US based tech rep per Amazon's reps suggestion.
