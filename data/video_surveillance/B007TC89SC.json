{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great picture and easy install!", "Author": "J. Patterson", "ReviewID": "R348Z7GMRINAD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Until 6 months ago I had never heard of Ubiquiti, now I'm a huge fan of their products.  I was looking for an outdoor IP camera in the $100 range.  I of course wanted to get a nice picture out of it and didn't want a lot of headaches when it came to installing.  I'm happy to say this met all my needs.This was my first experience with POE (power over ethernet) devices and have to say I love it!  For those that like to buy the DVR with 4 cameras it is a similar concept.  You don't need to run a long extension cord or worry about outside electrical boxes.  You just use the same Ethernet cables as you plug right into your computer and it powers the device.  It comes with a POE injector which is the little box that you do plug into an outlet.  I ended up plugging that box into an outlet and running the ethernet cable into the attic and outside to my camera.  I mounted it under the roof line on a side of the house that doesn't get blowing rain.  The install was easy enough and there were plenty of adjustments I could make to get the picture just right.  I ran all of my cables first and made sure that piece was all ready, so that when I went to install the camera and plugged in the cable, it was online and transmitting.  I took my 6\" tablet up the ladder with me so I could see a live picture from the camera as I was adjusting the focus and angel of tilt and such.  That made it so much easier, I don't like ladders and don't like reclimbing them to move it a little to the left!When done, I couldn't believe how clear the picture was for a $100 camera.  Now, I say this because I've used plenty of the DVR kits and cameras as well as some other IP cameras and I've never been very impressed.  For the first time I was impressed with a $100 camera.  This did exactly what I was wanting.  I wanted a nice crisp clear picture that would let me see a live view of what was happening in my driveway and yard.  This isn't a zoom in and see a license plate camera, but you aren't going to get that in this price range.  I've had it running now for about 6mths and have not had one issue with it.The on board web configuration software is just fine and I didn't have any issues with getting it configured.  I really only use this as a live view camera, I don't use any recording or capture software.  It has worked on all of my pad and smartphone devices as well as over the internet.Wonderful camera for the money.  They also make very good wifi devices which I also highly recommend.", "Date": "September 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Plays well with Ubiquiti bridge radios.", "Author": "Jeffrey D.

your Cat5 through the center of the mount. The image quality is good at 720 and they work surprisingly well even when it's nearly dark - without infrared. I use one above the garage to see when packages have arrived. When used with Blue Iris, you get motion sensitivity, saved image alerts and the usual features. They also work with Android's IP Cam Viewer. The thing that makes these cameras cool is their ability to get network and POE from other Ubiquiti products: NanoStation M2s/M5s have a second ethernet port that can feed a camera or another bridge radio with POE turned on or off. The NanoStation bridge radios go for miles, enabling you to connect houses, barns and shops with cameras at each location. Ubiquiti's POE makes installation much easier than having to bundle up thick cables inside a junction box or drill large holes to pass them through walls. Thankfully, each item comes with its own POE injector. No odd cables or adapters required - just Cat5. Speaking of Ubiquiti's included 24-volt POE adapters, their polarity may differ from other injectors you may be using. Positive is on pins 4&5 (blue), negative on pins 7&8 (brown).", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Camera for the Money", "Author": "Mark M. \"X111\"", "ReviewID": "R2D7Q8IKSFPYLL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera has a good picture, but not great.It is much better than the 600tvl or 700tvl cameras. However, although it is 1280/720 resolution, it is not as sharp as I was expecting.To focus the camera, you have to take off the lens cover, and turn the lens. It is very sensitive to move, so you have to be careful.The housing is great. They really thought through the overall design and it has great cable management and shading capabilities that many cameras miss.The software it comes with looks good, but is overcomplicated and buggy.

Canfield \"John - old geek\"", "ReviewID": "R1RUW6P33MJ831", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a big fan of Ubiquiti wireless products, I have their Bullets and Nanos all over our ranch bringing network connectivity to several out buildings and our house.  I needed an IP cam to monitor the water level in our water storage tanks so I thought I would give this inexpensive cam a try.One of my primary requirements was a PoE cam - no ridiculous dongles or power supply bricks to deal with in an outdoor setting and I wanted a weatherproof outdoor enclosure.  Since I did NOT need motion detection or FTP/email features, this cam seemed to perfectly fit my requirements.  When I need to check to check the water level, I simply log into the cam and have a look.  Periodic emailing of a picture would have been a nice feature, but that's not a critical requirement.As other reviews have mentioned, the plastic case at first seemed a little flimsy and low-end quality but it's really okay and quite functional.  I do have a complaint about the mounting bracket, you cannot point the camera at a 90 degree angle relative to the mounting bracket (foot.)  I had to make a wedge angled at about 15 degrees to mount to the building and then mount the cam to the wedge.I have no idea about Ubiquiti's DVR software, didn't use it and don't have a need to continuously record an image.The cam was easy to set up, there aren't a whole lot of settings to fiddle with.  Like the Ubiquiti network products, this cam has a ping watchdog that will ping an IP address and if there is no response, the cam will reboot itself (I set mine up to ping our primary router.)  With some hesitation I will mention that I have never had a network failure of any kind, the Bullets and Nanos are extremely reliable and if something goes stupid, they can all reboot themselves.  Very impressive reliability and I expect the same from this cam.As far as the cam image, it is outstanding for a camera in this price range - I have IP cams from the $100 to $600 price range (Panasonic, WansView, Toshiba, Mole, etc.) running and this cam's picture is amazing.  The color balance is the very best of any cam I have ever used.A caveat:  this cam likes daylight and is not a low light cam.  If you need a good low-light or no-light performer, look for another product.", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works great for the $, however", "Author": "J.

I believe you could find the pin out to use a standard POE switch if you were so inclined.  The build seems solid and more of a commercial grade than some of the many others I own.  The mount is nifty for sure but lacks some flexibility to use a standard bottom mount.  I wasn't looking for night vision and knew that when I bought it.  It works well with iCam software and is easy to setup.  I chose not to go the AirVision software route to manage it, but that looks very capable as well.

No standard holder/stand can be used with this camera, you have to use the provided one.The triangular section of the camera makes the fixing mandatory even for testing purposes, the apex of the triangle is facing downstairs so the camera can't stand on his own neither on a camera tripod, which I'm using for testing cameras.Image quality isn't \"amazing\" let's say it's average and I notice several point of out-of-focus on the mid-top of the image.To put the lens on focus the front protection must be unscrew and inside there is a very thin O-ring for weather protection.The software provided seems to be amazing but useless unless you have a single brand cameras by Ubiquiti.The camera is fully compatible with Blue Iris.I'm considering this camera expensive as it doesn't provide night view, wireless and standard installation.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointing image quality, good software", "Author": "C. Wood", "ReviewID": "RKQL1KJUQ5F1P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Based on the other reviews, perhaps I was expecting too much in the image quality department. I am using a Dropcam Pro as a reference, and with both at 720p, the Aircam image is comparatively very poor. You can switch the aircam resolution from 720p to 480p and see very little change in the image.Also the dropcam 135 degree wide angle is a plus in my application, versus the approx. 45 degree view of the aircam.On the plus side, I like that I am able to run my own server at a reasonable cost with the aircam. With the Dropcam you're pretty much hooked into a $10/month charge for the rest of your life. The free AirVision software for the Aircam is pretty good. I'm running it under Ubuntu on an old macbook running a Parallels virtual machine. Since the motion detection software runs on the camera, my old macbook has enough power to run the server --- it struggles with other cameras and software where the motion detection is on the server.With Airvision you can set up motion detection zones with arbitrarily complex shapes. You can't set up individual alert policies for the different zones, however. You have have to receive alerts from all zones of a camera or none. The alerts do include the name of the zone, so I use email filters manage the alerts I want to see. It would also be good if there was a way to trigger a shell script instead of sending an email when an alert is raised.", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wish it had night vision though", "Author": "Paul B.

But how does Robert Chou do great things for free with his IP Cam Viewer for smartphones, including listing Ubiquiti cameras as supported by him, for free, when others, including this software developer have trouble with more powerful Windows machines.  I don't understand it but a number of 3d party vendors do mention this camera....it's just that it doesn't seem to have that great of an image in low light levels or even daylight to differentiate it, cost-wise, from cheaper cameras plus it doesn't give you audio or PTZ.  I know this company does some good things with AP's, etc., but  manufacturers need to remember that when the average buyer purchases a complicated car, that seller doesn't expect the buyer to dig into the guts of the car to make the Goodyear tires work on the Toyota wheels with Brand X gas and Brand Y oil.  I've set up several different brands of wireless and wired DVR's, IP cams, servers, etc.  and this isn't one of the easier ones so i expected a significantly better image in exchange.  Disappointed. Software has issues with Internet Explorer, apparently, and favors other browsers, for starters, so that when you follow booklets directions, you run into a brick wall with installation / download.  From there it gets funner.
