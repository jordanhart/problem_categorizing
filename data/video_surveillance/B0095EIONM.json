Since i'm heavy into computers and the like, this wasn't terribly hard to get the hang of, but I can imagine someone like my mom or dad who just wants a minor surveillance system installed in their homes. This DVR is great, but can baffle a novice. IF you still want to try it out, be ready to do a bit of trial and error. Even I had to deal with some trial and error.

Christie", "ReviewID": "R87O1W33BCO14", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this a few days ago and it did take some research and trial and error to set it up correctly.  Setting up the cameras to the DVR is easy and took about five minutes.  Viewing the cameras with an iPhone (internally and externally) and through Internet Explorer over the web took a little perseverance, but I did get it to work.  If you don't know networking or computers, you will have trouble setting up the iPhone and viewing over the web, but you will still be able to record and view video through the DVR itself.  Use ZViewer for the iPhone (not sure about Android) and note you need to set up two separate devices inside the app: one for inside your network and one for outside.  I don't think many people realize that the IP settings will be different for internal and external viewing (though the gateway, port, username and other settings will be the same).  I have a Linksys Router with a cable modem.  I did not need my ISP to do anything or call ZModo for tech support, and I did not make any changes to my cable modem.  You will need to set up port forwarding in your router to view over the web.  The documentation is out there on the web (see ZModo's knowledge base), you just have to find the docs and be willing to stay with it.  Also, with the Web Client for EDVS/EDVR software (Internet Explorer through the Web) I have been able to save AVI files for viewing with Windows Media Player. I have not tried it with the USB port through the DVR itself yet, however.I gave this 4 stars because I feel like these systems, while they work fine at what they do, are not for the average user even though they are advertised as such.  They take some know how to set up and if you can't set it up and get it working, it's pretty much useless to you.  Feel free to post questions and I will see if I can help.  I would buy this again, since I know what I am doing.

However, I am very satisfied with this units functionality and versatility.Setup is easy. I am not a computer wiz by any means but I can figure out my way around a keyboard ;) (google, youtube and zmodo forums help a lot) If you are not concerned about plugging it in to a network this thing is literally plug and play out of the box within minutes.as far as network compatibility before doing anything make sure that your firewall is not blocking you from accessing your DVR I had to fully uninstall my aftermarket firewalls windows firewall is fine just allow access.Network setup takes a little bit longer but there is a zmodo website that will help you set up your router every step of the way . the zmodo website has you pick the router that you have and the main menu type that is on your zmodo and walks you through everything including making sure your ports are open in some cases one must call their internet provider to ensure they can open ports.  The only issue I had was that the ports the setup asked me to use were already taken so I used different ones. Once this is finished you will be able to access your footage on a device (once software is downloaded on device ie Zviewer for the phone and NVMS for windows [i have windows 8 which NVMS did not work for but you can open it under \"Windows XP (service pack 2)\" found within properties] I found NVMS on the zmodo website under the dvr model page)Remote setup was a little bit more difficult there is a separate IP for this (also you must know your Command port number for NVMS in network under DVR settings) in order to set it up on a phone or computer for remote viewing.Do a little research, have fun with it. The product works, no matter which one you decide to buy you will have to deal with the network issues. This is a good unit especially for the price.

To clarify, you do not have to have an internet connection to use this product if you don't want to access the DVR over wifi or 4G. You do need a monitor with a VGA cable to set this thing up (not sure if it works with RCA cables...)I don't think this is for the novice computer user. I have a strong background in computers, and it took me about an hour to iron out all the issues. It does have a few quirks that need to be anticipated to work correctly.There are some apps out there for accessing the camera feeds with advertisements, _make sure you download the FREE app called Zviewer_ instead of an app that wants you to pay to get rid of ads - Exact same functionality with no ads!The issue I had was that I tried to connect with a PC browser, and I tried to connect with the smartphone and neither would work (both on LAN and on 4G).The error on the phone would say \"Invalid Channel Number\" and the web based client wouldn't even go past the login screen.Under network settings, the setting called \"IP ACCESS\" must be set to \"Disable\" ... just a little counter-intuitive.The other issue is that it requires the \"A\" in \"Admin\" (the username) to be capitalized when logging in - otherwise you get the invalid channel number error.The only other issue was that when it arrived, it was scuffed up all over the top, but it seems to work fine so no worries.As others have said, it will take some trial and error to get it to function properly, but I feel like it is a decent product given the price point.", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Zmodo 8 Channel Security CCTV Surveillance DVR", "Author": "57_panhead", "ReviewID": "R14TVQBM4OJSBC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Very hard to set up, does not allow download files in AVI, MPG or any other media file.

I had no problem hooking it up myself.  The instructions aren't great, but with a little tinkering I got it all figured out in under 30 minutes.  There are lots of different options for adjusting the quality of the video.  I have a single camera installed right now and with 24 hour recording at the default video setting I can record continously for over 400 days without it rewriting any data.  My only complaint is that the remote that came with does not always work the greatest which is why I rated it 4 stars.  The cover on the battery compartment doesn't want to hold the batteries in completely even with some electrical tape.  I am going to try to get it replaced and I can't tell you if all the remotes are like this.

FYI, the ports you need to open according to their website and included documentation are not correct. Nor I was able to get it working with their software. I got it working using IP Cam Viewer Lite software.Email notification: The implementation of this ability is terrible.  You can't set what time period you want to received the notifications. It is either on or off. So during the day while the store is open we constantly receive email notifications that motion has been detected, which is overwhelming and expensive if you are on a limited data plan. Also you can't set any kind of delay in how often the alerts are sent, so we received an email every 20 secs telling us motion had been detected.Ideally we would like to only receive the alerts during the hours the store is closed and an e-mail alert every 3mins would be more practical then every 20 secs.Unfortunately it took to long setup this device and get confirmation (a week) from the manufacture that in fact there is no settings or controls for email notification that we can no longer return the device.If someone knows of a DVR that will let you control the email notification I would appreciate a msg.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great stuff!!!", "Author": "rnyproduction", "ReviewID": "R30DO0DO1LBR9P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to install and Internet instruction step by step instruction was very helpfully.
