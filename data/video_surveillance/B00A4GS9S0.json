No hardware issues (see '2' below for additional step).I recently installed a home security system that is monitored through a local company. This radio was quick and easy to install; however, I do have some recommendations to future installers:1) On your control panel, if you don't have an LT-cable from Honeywell, it may be easier to unscrew the transformer from the wall to disconnect the power. Otherwise, you'll be walking back/forth to the circuit breaker.2) If you want the GSM to be the primary communication method to your monitoring company, you'll need to verify the setting. My Lynx 5100 touch didn't update the communication method and wouldn't immediately dial out when in test mode. There are details on this in the manual.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00A4GS9S0"}}
