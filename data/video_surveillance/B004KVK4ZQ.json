The power supply failed after about 3 months but was promptly replaced by the seller. after I installed the new power supply I could not get it to work wirelessly any more. Overall I would not recommend this unit.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good nite vision", "Author": "Robert L. Wavershak", "ReviewID": "R2CQZ4R7YRYA1N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Not a bad camera...the wireless though is just unacceptable. I personally would prefer the wired part even if the wireless worked well. It's a little rough around the edges with flashing during the day. The camera is susceptable to any glare or bright light during the day. Some adjustments can be made but in one instance I had to reduce the res on one camera to 320 x ?. The other two run 640 x 480 but some contrast and brightness on one had to be toned down a litte. Plan on running the power supply close to the camera as any extension really reduces the 5VDC.", "Date": "July 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "security camera", "Author": "frank f", "ReviewID": "R16G185BDWCH3J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "camera works great, except wireless does not work for me on my metal building, had to hard wire and that works great.
