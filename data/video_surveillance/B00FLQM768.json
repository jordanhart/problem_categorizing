One of the things I really liked was the built in thermometer that displays the room temperature along with the time and date (if selected) on a small banner on the image. I ended up returning the camera because of setup issues and nearly non-existent support. After waiting on hold for nearly an hour I was number 18 (I started at 32) in the queue and the automated attendant said my wait would be over an hour.I gave the camera a 3 star rating because it does have some cool features and others may not mind the short comings that I had issue with.Pros:720 HD videoSensitive mic for audioBuilt in thermometerIR cut filter (better night performance)On-board storage VIA microSD cardCons:No tech support unless you register the camera providing all personal information.Tech support has very long wait times.Set up seems to require you to use Lorex's cloud video server, (privacy issues?) I was able to access the cameras setup menu using a browser but never could get to view video in the browser. I also read that Internet Explorer is required because of the need for Active X. No FireFox, Safari, Chrome, etc. I was able to view the cameras video using the provided, proprietary L-View software.The IR illuminator is not very bright so distance is limited at night.The lens is not very wide angle (this could be good or bad depending on your needs).I have two other IP cameras that I use (different brands) and haven't had nearly the set up trouble I had with this one. I fully admit that the set up issues are likely due to my preference to not use the Cloud and not use Internet Explorer. I prefer to keep my camera's video on my local network not streaming around the internet. Maybe there's a way to do that but I couldn't get through to Tech support to ask the question.", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect.

Easy set Up Works Perfect", "Author": "Suktaradox", "ReviewID": "R1E9OCBZ9BEUY8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great little IP Camera.It sets up so easy. I set this one up with just my IPhone 5s.Lorex has a great video online explaining how to set up this camera.The software that comes with this camera is also great. it supports 16 cameras as opposed to the old software that supported 4.You can record directly to the camera itself with a micro SD card. Or to the iPhone or to a computer that is hooked up to your network. This is what I do. I record to me PC. Then I have a upload stream to a cloud server just incase someone breaks in and smashes my computer.The motion detection feature is amazing. Best I have seen in these types of camera. I can set it to send images to my email address. and the sensitivity settings can be adjusted to low or high sensitivity.I used this camera once to try to capture a mouse that was in my garage. I set up a mouse trap and this camera and the motion sensor went off and the camera emailed me the image of the mouse being killed, it was great. The garage was in total darkness but the image and video were crystal clear and bright.Some tricks for set up.If you are having trouble having the camera stay connected to your Wi-Fi you have to log in to your router and changethe wireless settings for channel width to auto 20 or 40 Mhz. If you have it set to 20 Mhz it will just keep connecting and then disconnecting repeatedly.Also when setting up camera try to keep it level or even (not pointing down or up) Because at night in total darkness the infrared will be at an angle and not illuminate the entire seen. If its even then the entire area is bright and clear.", "Date": "April 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very good.

To clarify the HD recording capability of Lorex LNC201 IP camera, 720p HD recording is available when changing the recording to a Network Attached Storage device (NAS). Currently the camera records to an SD card at a maximum resolution of 1024x768, which is linked to the Mobile resolution setting. The camera is not restricted to 320x240 (VGA) level. To increase the resolution of the recording (above the VGA setting), open the menu and select the Mobile resolution setting. Change this to the maximum of 1024x768 - this will also set the SD card to record at this much higher resolution.---ahah!  so there's a 'secret' SD recording setting that is not clearly documented in the instruction manual, and that the lorex phone support people aren't even aware about!  so now the recoding capabilities we have are:320x240 (QVGA) -default 'max' resolution recording on SD card640x480 (VGA)1024x768 (XGA) -secret/obscure max resolution recording on SD card (see below)1280x800 (WXGA/HD/720p) -max resolution recording only on Network Attached Storage device (NAS)to increase recording resolution to SD card above the VGA setting:open the menu and select the Mobile resolution setting. Change this to the maximum of 1024x768 - this will also set the SD card to record at this much higher resolution.okay, this is better, but it still doesn't record to the local SD memory card at HD resolution, which is what their advertising leads you to believe.  i'm glad it does record at up to 1024x768 to local SD though, so i will end up keeping this.lorex still needs to;1. improve the accuracy of their documentation2. improve their online customer support so that a phone call is not required3. improve their phone support4. market their products in a non-misleading way with clearer specifications and abilities", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Look elsewhere, you get what you pay for.", "Author": "MattO", "ReviewID": "R1YDIKD0R64VFC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have 4 LNC 216.  I would recommend NOT purchasing them.  Here is why:1. Video quality is poor.2. Temp sensor is always 10 degrees off3. PIR motion sensor really blows compared to my $400 Vivotek camera4. Tech support, try call their tech support before purchasing and listen to # of minutes wait.  It is ALWAYS 45+ minutes.  Their email support is also horrible.5.  The iPhone/ipad app has no way to do fast forward / rewind of videos from the NAS/camera SD card.6.  These are just rebranded Starvedia cameras, lorex doesn't even make them.7.  Cameras have small blips where they stop recording to NAS, and occasionally stop writing altogether until you REBOOT them.8.  No way to get firmware updates from lorex.  Starvedia has more recent firmwares from their FTP, but lorex is many firmware behind Starvedia.All in all, VERY UNSTABLE cameras.", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Camera, Horrible Support and no remote viewing", "Author": "Shawn Ferraro", "ReviewID": "R3FKILTD2PA9XK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The camera itself is pretty decent.  Nice quality for the price, and the ability to record to an SD card is nice.  I have noticed however when recording by motion, it only records at most 30 seconds.  It will immediately start another file, however if your trying to watch a 5-10 minute span it gets annoying having to open and view so many files.DO NOT get this camera if you need access via the internet.  It works great as a LAN (Local Area Network) Camera.  What this means, is to view the video, whether live or not your device mus be on the same network as the camera.  This makes features like email alerts when motion is detected useless, as even after you get the alert you cannot view the video unless you are home.  If I was home, I wouldn't need the email alert.I give this camera a 2 Star because of 2 reasons.  1.) They advertise that you can access the video over the internet.  This just is not true.  At least I cannot figure out how to do it, and I am pretty technologically advanced.  I work for a major networking company, so I do know a thing or two about networks.  The 2nd reason for the low rating is because Lorex Support is as awful as advertised.  I currently have 4 cases open with them all on the remote viewing issue.  I have received the same response on all 4 cases, \"Just read the manual, it tells you there how to do it\".  This would not be bad advice if the manual was actually worth the paper it was printed on.  However it is not.  I set the camera up exactly like it states to do in the manual.  Like I mentioned previously, I can access the video as long as I am connected to the same network, but leave the house and there is no way to view the video.Another note on how awful Lorex Support is, if  you open a case via the online portal, they will tell you to call their 1-800 number.  They will not even try to help you.  If you call the number, be prepared to wait about an hour before you actually reach a person.  Then, even once you reach a person be prepared.  They are very rude.  I had one technician hang up on me just because after two hours I told him I was going to have to drop soon to go pick up my son.  He just hung up.In conclusion, the camera itself is not bad if yoo don't mind the fact you cannot view video remotely.  But since that is why I got the camera in the first place I cannot give it more than 3 stars.  I had to dock another star off because of their poor customer service and lack of technical support.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00FLQM768"}}
