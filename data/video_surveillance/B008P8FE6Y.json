It's obviously night, with a street light close by.  Anybody walking would be unrecognizable on this camera at night.  The daylight function of the camera is very good, although the colors are a bit off, but the clarity and zoom functions are good.  The focus is a bit slow day or night and takes a bit of time to adjust, usually resulting in a good focus.  I also have the PRO-750 camera, and the night capabilities of that camera are far better, althought they are both rated the same 0.01 Lux.To make matters worse, I have tried to contact Swann Customer support, and they have not responded to any of my e-mails.  I would say DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA!The original rating of the camera was 3 star, but the total lack of customer support makes me change my rating to one star.", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best cost-effective PTZ camera I could find", "Author": "Nacman \"Raylie\"", "ReviewID": "R17B6M5YPHT96N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Initially skeptical, thought the cost was too low for a quality product and found one description indicating the camera had a IP54 rating (this refers to dust and water protection, higher numbers, 66 & 67, are best).Actually a very good camera, both day and night. The resolution is better than another 2 MP camera we have! The pan, tilt, and zoom can be set as fast as you wish. The camera automatically refocuses after each zoom, fairly fast but not instantaneous. This camera does not have IR emitters, yet in my tests had a better night picture than some cams with IR. Note that cheap stand-alone automatic IR emitters are available on Amazon.The camera shipped to me is rated at IP66, so that was a non-worry.  I highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrific camera", "Author": "Edward Montano", "ReviewID": "R1IOC3GZJNYTYE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a terrific camera, I wish the auto focus was a little faster but otherwise a well made camera.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderful camera", "Author": "Madge", "ReviewID": "R3SWIR3QRQ6ZF4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this camera in 4 days after I ordered it and I'm very impressed with that.  Installed it the same day and everything works as it should.  It does not have infrared illumination but, it is very sensitive to any light.  I have it installed where I can observe my front yard and various areas and my front yard is in total darkness.  I turned the porch light on and it has only a 40 watt bulb and that made a major difference.  I have read the specs from other companies that had this camera for sale and some of them said it had infrared illumination and some said not but, it really didn't matter to me so I went ahead and bought it.  It has a very sharp picture.  I'm very impressed with the 700 TVL.

Heim", "ReviewID": "R2OXB9SPGRB4CM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera directly from the Swann online store in January. We were very happy with it overall. Yes, it does take a little longer than I would like to refocus after being moved. This is very annoying if you have it set up to constantly scan back and forth with several stop points. Basically, you can't have very many stop points or it is useless. This wasn't a huge issue for us.However, we live in Arizona, and recently entered the monsoon season. After the first rain, I noticed that the colors were significantly distorted to a fluorescent green and there were horizontal lines across the screen. This went away after the rain stopped and it dried out. Unfortunately, with more rains and high humidity, this problem kept occurring more frequently. I contacted Swann support and they agreed to an RMA. I shipped off the camera on a Monday and it (or another one) was returned today, August 10th, twelve days later. Upon attaching the returned camera to our system we found that it moved very sluggishly and then just got stuck. We messed with it for about an hour trying to get it to work to no avail. It would move a little and then get stuck again. It also would not zoom out to the level our original camera did.I will contact Swann support again on Monday. Hopefully, I will get satisfaction... Update to be posted.BTW... to the person who posted that they emailed support... Try their phone number.

I added this one for the increased zoom, and after 2 weeks I am still happy with it. I wish the night vision was on par with my other camera, but it is not, regardless it does a fine job. The focus can lag at times, and the pan speed can be too fast or too slow depending on your level of zoom, you can adjust it before hand, but thats a bit of a pain.
