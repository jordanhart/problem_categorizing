I have an 8 camera system.  I don't see any picture difference between the camera with and without the extension cables. I purchase mine for $10 each sold by amazon.com.  I noticed they are actually a little thicker than the ones that came with the cameras.  I will note that these are not direct extension cables.  They are the same type of cable that came with the cameras.  They have 2 male bnc connects and 1 male and 1 female dc power connector.  To use it as an extension you need to use the \"included\" BNC female to female coupler.  Looking back now I think I would have just purchased the 130' cable and used it instead of 2 65' connected to each other.  That way I didn't have to worry about it getting wet under my house.", "Date": "July 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "GOOD CABLE", "Author": "Pat L.

The cable came with a male video and male power connection on one end and a female video and female power connection on the other end.  I could connect one end of the cable using the male adapters I had ordered but could not connect the other video end without a second (female) adapter which I did not have.To Amazon's credit they quickly authorized return of the cables and processed a refund including a portion of the expedited delivery fee.  This is the first time I have had to return anything to Amazon.  I will definitely continue to purchase items through them.If you are purchasing extension cables for your security camera system, double-check the fittings on the camera and existing cable before ordering the extension cables.", "Date": "September 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "It Works", "Author": "jonnii", "ReviewID": "R1BUJG3Z1Y0Y3M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It works fine.

I had 2 new cameras I wanted to add to my DVR but the standard 60 foot included cable was not going to reach the distance that I needed it to.  This cable worked perfectly with my current Defender cameras and provided great picture allowing me to reach the distance I needed to cover.One thing worth noting is that, in general, you don't want to have a cable run of longer than 180 feet.  Signal degrades over length no matter the quality of the cable and in my experience you can run 120 feet of cable with no noticeable quality loss but when you reach 180 and over the picture becomes more grainy and distorted.  Overall this is a good quality cable to match up with a current Defender camera system.", "Date": "August 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "not as shown", "Author": "bamboozled", "ReviewID": "R1OVH8CE5OR7Q9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Most of the video cables and the ones shown in the picture have two female BNC connectors.
