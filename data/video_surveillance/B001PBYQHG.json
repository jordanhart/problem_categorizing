{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "cliffhokie", "ReviewID": "R1TNYK5K582BD2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're like me, you HATE monthly reoccurring charges, such as cable, insurance, cell phone companies (I'm looking at you Verizon), etc.  Why burn money every month on reoccurring charges?  I like to have controlled costs and very little \"renting\" reoccurring charges.  But, I also have a family and like to feel secure, along with getting the home owners insurance discount often offered with home security systems.  I've used ADT, Brinks, Broadview, etc. at prior homes.  However, when I moved, I wanted to avoid having a land line (cell signal is virtually radioactive in my house, even in the basement).  However, the biggest problem I had was that most companies charged ridiculous rates for their wireless monitoring service ($5 additional was the cheapest I could find).  In addition, the base monthly rate was fairly high, averaging about $35 (ADT was charging me $45 w/o the wireless), with Ackerman coming in the cheapest at $18 (w/ wireless, they were $23/month).  I thought about using Ackerman because I preferred a \"professional\" doing the job, much like when I had ADT.  But, when I experienced their sales rep, lack of customer service, and overall horrible experience, I knew they weren't a legit company I wanted to trust my home and money to.  ADT and all of the other more high profile personal home security companies were far too expensive and I would either have to get a home line or pay extra monthly. So, I looked into \"Do it yourself\" home monitoring and found this company along with two others (one is sold at Lowes).  This one seemed to have the best monthly price, price of equipment, and reviews, so I decided to bite the bullet and give it a try despite my hesitations of the unknown.I've now used this system for several months, and here are the pros and cons:Pros:There is no shady sales person that comes to your house, that refuse to give you a solid quote over the phone, only to upcharge you DURING the install and after you sign the contract.  This is what Ackerman security tried to pull on my wife and myself and exactly why we cancelled our contract (which they tried to tell us we couldn't).  Other companies weren't as shady, but still made obvious attempts at upselling through scare tactics.  With this system, what you buy is what you get, no hidden monthly costs or \"after-the-fact\" purchases.  You order through a simple online system completely a la carte, or you can start out with the starter kit (perfect for an apartment) and then add on.  You can also call in your order.  You then have only one of two monthly possible charges, the basic monitoring which I got (exactly the same as my prior monitoring through the big name companies) where they call you and ask for the code when your alarm is set off, or the slightly more expensive version where you also get text alerts and smartphone app support (I think it is $25/month).  Either way, the price is CHEAP. I pay $15 a month.  That's it.  No upcharge, no extra wireless charge, etc.They are constantly improving their options.  They now have flood detection, a more high tech base with more capabilities, and I'm pretty sure they have several other options to include video monitoring coming up as well as carbon monoxide detection, etc.  If they don't have it now, wait a few months, they are always adding options.  And best of all, you only have to pay for the equipment.  For most like me, they have all of the basic equipment you need such as a panic button, remote, keypad with LCD display, motion detectors, window and door sensors, etc.Price is almost the same as the \"included\" equipment with ADT, Ackerman, etc.  The problem with the big companies is that they almost always offer supposedly \"free equipment\", but it is only the keypad, remote is NOT included, and a couple sensors, usually two or three, and maybe a motion detector.  Most houses have at least six windows and two to three doors that need sensors.  At my last house, I had to shell out $350 extra on top of the \"free\" equipment to equip my first floor and walkout basement doors and windows.  What if you buy a house that already has an alarm system?  At this house, it was already equipped with an ADT alarm, which Ackerman claimed they could use and save us money, but after signing the contract, the installation guy tried to charge $300 more for \"additional equipment\" needed to make it work and supposed faulty sensors.  All this was told to us AFTER the installation guy to put in the new computer.  News flash, the sensors in traditional wired home alarms are only two magnets with a wire going back to the brain.  Why was he a) saying they were broken when they clearly weren't and b) charging $50 per unit?!?!?  Anyway, this is just a perfect example a bogus upcharges you get with these companies trying to make an extra buck at your expense.  I paid $400 for my entire basement and first floor coverage, to include 14 windows, three doors, the base, the digital key pad, detector, and remote (love having a remote!).  I can add additional stuff at any time and the equipment is very competitively priced.  It's more money up front for most, but honestly, I paid $100 more than my next best option and I own the equipment myself.  Even if you didn't have to pay anything whatsoever from the other company for the equipment and installation, which is highly unlikley, your monthly charges will equal out in less than two years in most instances through companies like ADT (except for Ackerman).  At only $100 difference, I paid the difference in compared to Ackerman's $23 wireless service in one year.  Over the course of several years, you will make up for what you pay for your Simplisafe system many times over.What people don't realize is that often, when your alarm is set, the call center that calls you is outsourced.  These call centers usually provide alarm call center services to all the competitors.  Because they use a certified call center, you get an Insurance certificate that you can use to get a home owners discount, just like ADT, Vector, Ackerman, etc.  And best part, one time, when we accidentally set off our alarm, I asked the guy if this was the call center from SimpliSafe, he said he didn't know, they provided service to Simplisafe along with several other companies and listed off five other companies, including... ADT!  It was some call center in Jersey.  Anyway, same service, same discount, no big name company needed.As I mentioned before, if you live in an area with decent cell signal, you don't need a land line with this! Has worked flawless so far for us.The price is AMAZING!!!  I saw only one company offer something cheaper, the one from Lowes (forget their brand they carry), but the reviews I saw weren't very good regarding the equipment, it lacked the diversity of equipment and services, and the cost saving was only two or three dollars a month.  Otherwise, I am coming in a LOT cheaper than going through a major company.  Must have made my neighbor upset, since he is an ADT sales rep.There is no contract. At all.  EVERY other company I called from the major retailers required at least two years to \"subsidize\" their installation and you couldn't get out unless you moved the service, require installation at the new place and a transfer fee.  Some were as many as three years commitment.  What if you move before then?  With SimpliSafe, NO CONTRACT!If you want, you can use your alarm without the monthly call center service, maybe you hit hard times or are moving, etc.  Turn it off for a month or more, then turn it back on whenever you want!You can move the equipment and service with you wherever you want.  This is great for military families or renters.Set up is EASY. Took me 30 minutes for a 4000 sq ft home, and I was taking my time to be careful.  Units are preprogrammed before delivered.OK, I know, this sounds stupid, but it's so true.  I hate calling customer service lines, and while their customer service line has been perfectly fine when I've had to call them, their Facebook page is awesome!  They honestly read all the comments and respond with answers to questions and solutions to problems.  I wouldn't suggest this for major issues, but honestly, great resource, I rarely see other companies put the time and effort into their Facebook and timely customer feedback (usually get answers in a couple hours in FB).  They also list new product announcements on there.Online access to account, sensors, alarm history, changes to your system functions, etc. You don't have to go through a stupid key pad with either a tiny LCD screen and only numbers, or worse, only blinking LEDs to tell you you did something right or wrong.Cons:The equipment felt a little cheaper relatively, not quite as quality as some other companies, most notably in the window/door sensors.  Additionally, they use one AA battery in each sensor, so the sensors are relatively LARGE on one side.  I do like the blue indication LED on them that blinks when the unit opens or closes, but overall, they aren't very low profile like wired sensors from ADT, etc. This became a problem with some of our windows which have the larger wood blinds that rub up against the sensors.  The equipment works perfectly, but you can't help but notice that they are a step below in aesthetic and ergonomic quality.The way they get around having individual installation capable without professionals is that each unit is battery powered, so no drilling and running wires.  However, this means that every sensor has batteries.  Batteries have to be replaced every five years.  The good news is that they come with lithium AA batteries, and they are easily replaceable.  However, this is a little bit of a hassle if you have a lot of doors, etc., and have to replace them all in five years.  However, 30 minutes every five years for free installation?  The base is wired and carries a couple day charge should the power go out.  This is good, because you don't have to worry about losing functionality in the event of a power outage.  However, this is still a little bit of a hassle and sensors like the main door will probably have to be replaced sooner than others that get triggered rarely.  The good thing is the base tells you when a sensor is out.In addition, to make the install easier, they use 3M adhesive tape on the backs.  Mine have stuck perfectly thus far, but I would much prefer a sturdier way to install for those of us willing to put in the extra time, something involving nails/screws.  I don't know what the longevity of 3M is, but I will keep my fingers crossed on this one.The base unit isn't loud as I'd prefer.  This might be fine for a smaller house or apartment, but for a larger house, you can't hear it that well from other floors.  They do have an optional louder speaker that is more than loud enough (almost too loud), I just wish that they had offered a little more decibels in the base unit.I like the fact that the base unit has a backup battery and love the blue LED indicator.  However, I don't like the aesthetic style and it has to be within a certain distance from the key pad.  I wish the base had a better range to communicate with the key pad so I could put it in a more discreet location, some people may not have a lot of flexibility in where to put this unit.This isn't really their fault, more of a warning for those that order without reading the details from the company that are advertised on their page.  They do say this isn't meant for large homes. I'm stretching the limits of this units range with my 4000 sq ft home (3000 on two floors and 1000 in a finished basement).  I think they suggest 5000 sq ft is the max recommended for the sensors to communicate with one base.  It works fine for mine, but any larger and this might pose a problem.  I believe I have a fairly large house, but obviously, there are ones larger than mine.Remote works, but the USB cap is poorly designed, it will not stay on.  This is minor, and doesn't affect functionality, but it does make the remote look a little cheap with the cap missing, looks like a large USB stick on your keychain.You MUST have good T-Mobile cell signal where you are.  Mine is ridiculously good, but you really just need decent signal.  If you are really rural where cell signal is nonexistent, wireless might not be an option for you.  You can plug it in via Ethernet chord or phone line as well, if I'm not mistaken, and still enjoy a low cost alternative to the big companies.You don't have as much customization options such as allowing for certain home functions like setting the alarm to only go off with certain sensors at certain times, etc.Conclusion:Okay, so the lists look similar in length.  However, most of my gripes in the cons are either warnings for certain customers that won't be able to use this, or, minor ones, ones involving aesthetics and ergonomics, not so much in functionality.  I gave these mostly as a \"heads up\" to individuals.  The truth is, I have zero regrets with this system.  It works, it works well, there is zero fluff, they advertize what it does and doesn't do, and honestly, I basically get everything I got from the other companies, more in some instances since they are all about technology improvement and are constantly upgrading their equipment.  If I have to sacrifice a couple minor things such as larger sensors or minor aesthetic or ergonomic flaws for all the benefits I get, count me in!  LOVE IT!  And best parts, no contract, commitment, shady sales guy, and the monthly price is AWESOME.  I feel that I have a lot of perspective in this too since I've used several other companies before, all traditional type services.  I would recommend this to anyone that fits in the categories I have mentioned needing an alarm.  If you aren't frugal and don't mind wasting your money on more expensive monthly systems that lock you in, go for it, there's a sucker born every minute.  Otherwise, buy this system!*Update:  Correction, it isn't AA lithium batteries, it is CR123A. Looks like AA, but not as common. Bad news, it costs $4.95 per battery! through SimpliSafe. Good news is Amazon has these batteries through companies like Energizer for $12 for an eight pack.*Update 2 (1/7/14): Year and a half and going, here is the update so far.  The base station does use AA's while the sensors use the CR123A. This comes in handy because the base pad batteries have already had to be replaced once due to low power after approximately 9 months.  Uses 4 (I think) and are definitely cheaper (I purchase a ton at Costco at a time anyways for all of my remotes).  I'm not sure if I had to replace them this early because it is the most used device (I use the keypad everyday) or because their original batteries were cheap knockoff brand, or both.  I'm hoping my lithium batteries in next will last over a year ($1 a year investment).  Replacement was dead simple.  Pull off wall (plate stays behind), replace, pop back on wall plate.  The sensors still work (I did have to reposition one because it was not close enough).  The system works as I can attest to after accidentally setting it off several times myself and also while someone was housesitting once and I always get a call from the security company asking if everything is ok.  Definitely a great product so far. If something goes wrong that will make me think otherwise, will be sure to update.", "Date": "October 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Alternative but far from perfect!", "Author": "J_Onyx \"I never let my schooling interfere wi...", "ReviewID": "R1KU2FZ8194S5N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I write this from conviction that people thinking of investing in this alarm system alternative need a more thoughtful review than the many here who quickly post a gushing review and the few who post nonsense negative reviews.1st Simplisafe is easy to install yourself and it is a quality budget alternative to the big alarm system companies (who rely on less than ethical sales methods) who relieve people of a few thousand dollars and lock them into an expensive 2 to 3 year monitoring contract.The hardware is easy to install and get working & for less than $400 most people can seriously discourage felons from targeting their home. Simplisafe is much more up front & consumer oriented than other alarm companies BUT Simplisafe sales department does do its share of hype & exaggeration. You cannot install the sensors & motion detectors in the mindless simple way you are lead to believe. If you slap them up in a few minutes, you will regret it. Take a few minutes and determine the best places to position the sensors & detectors.The advertising shows people just mindlessly sticking sensors and detectors around their house. Then, in response to criticism that people report their senors or detectors fell off, Simplisafe blames it on the owner for not (dah...) cleaning the area first. Even that is hype because cleaning is not enough. It's not wise to just rely on the sticky tape for the heavier pieces, especially the keypad and the motion detectors. Simplisafe techs know this which is why each sensor has a removable installation panel with two screw holes and screws.There are two significant flaws in the Simplisafe system which Simplisafe advertising and information tip toes around and buyers do not realize until after they buy and install their system. I'll bet many long term Simplisafe owners still do not know about the flaws.FLAW NUMBER ONE IS THE ENTRY SENSOR. They are excellent for your outside doors but inadequate for windows. The problem? Unlike the wired big alarm company alarm systems, Simplisafe sensors are \"one size fits all\" but what is good for a door is not good enough for windows. The 21st century home B&E; is smash and grab. Unless you live in a high end home in an upper income neighborhood, you are at risk for an amateur smash and grab break-in or the new wave home invasion. Your break-in felon is most probably full-time party animals feeding some drug habit lifestyle. They usually break or cut windows, not carefully pry them open or try windows until they find one they can open. Simplisafe entry sensors work only when a door or window is properly opened.Its best to use the motion detectors to cover entire rooms and their windows and use the entry sensors just for doors. You may also want to consider NOT using the SIMPLISAFE signs but buy ADT or Brinks signs and decals instead. Some party animal groups think their way to researching alarm systems on Internet and they know about cell phone apps that they can use to monitor police radio activity. Ann Arbor, Michigan just arrest a gang of four such felons. Alarms didn't stop them. A member was stopped with stolen property in his car. He told on the others so he could get off easy.SECOND FLAW IS THE Alarm. It Is REMARKABLY WEAK! Do not simply rely on the ineffective alarm that comes in the base unit or simply on monitoring services. When seconds count, the police are always minutes away and their budgets are being seriously cut at the same time property crime is soaring. Buy the \"extra siren\" & mount it outside. The siren irritates the entire neighborhood. The felon isn't going to risk that rare neighbor who cares enough to look and call the police. Consider adding a wireless security camera. Mine sends condensed video to a remote 30 day DVR.There are unemphasized positives about Simplisafe, namely the keychain remote. It includes a panic button which instantly sets off the alarm and launches the call center into action. Monitoring is only 14.99 a month. For an elderly relative living alone the panic button alone is worth the cost of a Simplisafe System. Seniors can use it to live more safely and 14.99 a month for home alarm, personal safety and health is a real bargain. Those EMT service call button services (Call for help) alone cost $40 or more a month!", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great system if you do your homework", "Author": "JD", "ReviewID": "R2PSXFJWFBKPTY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I installed this system on 06/14/2013.  I did a bunch of research and found many of the online reviews to be dated and inaccurate since the new SimpliSafe2 came out in 2012.  I absolutely love the system but if you don't think through your purchase you might be disappointed.  Let's talk about the gotchya's:1) Buy extra sirens!  The base unit comes with an 85db siren and if it's the only one you have then the thieves will know EXACTLY where to find it and smash it before your 30 second entry delay is up.  Extra sirens will beep on the entry delay and when in full alarm sounding mode they will drown out the base siren and the thieves will be less likely to find your base station and destroy it before the signal goes out to the monitoring company.2) Buy extra motion sensors for rooms with your most vulnerable windows.  If a thief smashes a window the entry sensor will never trip since it never moves.  Security is always best in layers!  I chose to add motion sensors for my doors as well so I have TWO layers of detection on all my most vulnerable entry points.3) The cellular network used by SimpliSafe is T-Mobile.  Make sure you've got a good signal.  I'm in the middle of a major city so this is not an issue.4) The wood screws that come in the package are not good for mounting entry sensors on steel/metal doors.  You might need to make a trip to the hardware store for appropriate screws if you don't want to use the double sided sticky tape provided with the equipment.Now let's move on to unadvertised, yet complained about, issues:1) All new equipment can be mounted with screws.  Take the extra time to screw things in.  It will help prevent false alarms from stuff falling off doors and walls and the purpose of your system is to protect your life and property.  The tape is good but screws will always be better.2) The system is AMAZINGLY flexible and the website is awesome!  Each sensor is unique and can be given a name.  They can also be set to instantly trigger the alarm whether in home or away mode OR just send an SMS/E-mail when triggered.  You can change the time of the entry delay for home or away mode.  Sadly there is no exit delay for home mode which kinda sucks if you're leaving the house and your spouse and/or children are still inside.  Eh, I have the $25 monitoring package so I can set home mode from my smart phone...  The app is great too!3) Only the base station talks to you.  It would be nice if the keypads talked/beeped too.4) The SMS & email alerts are fantastic.  You can add as many as you like.5) After it's all installed it takes the company 72 hours before they will begin to dispatch police for alarms.  They call this a \"Practice Mode\".  At first I was a bit irritated but after a couple days I learned to appreciate it.  I accidentally triggered my alarm a few times because I forgot to take it out of home mode when I walked out a door.  I've learned... thanks to the practice.Conclusion:SimpliSafe went out of their way to respond to customer complaints and address those issues in the SimpliSafe2.  They also went out of their way to make the system easy to install and operate.  It's really simple and intuitive.  The setup CD had step by step instructions.  I sent an e-mail with a question and they responded in a timely fashion.  The website is incredibly easy to use and a very powerful control system for the alarm which was an unexpected surprise.  Do your homework, be thoughtful about how and where you place your sensors, and you too should have a good experience with this system.", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Quality System for Home Security", "Author": "C. Chrystal", "ReviewID": "R1FTEY58PDH0BC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After combing the internet for DIY home security systems, I came across SimpliSafe.  I just installed and tested the unit, and am so enthusiastic about it I notified my siblings about it.  Now, I'm writing about it here, hoping to spread the word and support this great company.Installing SimpliSafe is a piece of cake, and even fun.  No knowledge of electronics is needed.  There are no wires to hide or worry about.  Directions are straightforward and complete.  There is a great website and call-in service if you do have questions or problems, which seems unlikely.The components are \"stick on\" but are designed so you can remove them easily without damaging paint, walls or woodwork.  The tape itself is very strong, but in the remote case you have any doubts, you can screw the components on . . . but you won't want to.  All components are of obviously high quality, and are neither large nor ostentatious.  They can even be painted if you want them to fit in with your decor.The system is totally wireless.  The available window sensors, panic buttons, and motion detectors have long-life batteries and are linked to a keypad and a separate base unit that connects via satellite to a (peopled) dispatch center.  You will not need to \"hard wire\" anything.  Although you have the option to do so, you will not need to connect the base unit to your telephone line.  If a prospective burglar cuts your phone line you will still be protected.  That alone is one reason why you should consider this system.The cost of the system is quite low considering the intelligent design and quality of it, and you can add components easily and cheaply.  (I had initially thought to cobble together my own home security system, but was shocked when I saw how costly the parts would be.)  You may get a break on your homeowner's insurance having it installed, saving you money.  By the way, you -own- this system, don't rent it, and it is portable.  If you move around, you take SimpliSafe with you.In the event that someone trips a sensor accidentally, you can easily stop the system from notifying the (optional) dispatch service.  On the other hand, if someone breaks into your abode and trips the alarm, the dispatch service will first try to reach you by phone, and failing that, will call the police.  This is standard practice for burglar alarms, I understand, but if you elect to use the dispatch service it will only cost you $15.00 per month, and there is no contract to sign.  Many companies (ADT, Brinks, etc.) make you sign a contract, then soak you at a high monthly rate.  Not SimpliSafe.I should mention the matter of pets and motion detectors.  This was a big concern for me and my wife, for we have seven cats that just love to jump on furniture, run around, cavort, etc., and we thought they surely would trigger false alarms.  Not so.  Thoughtful placement of motion detectors obviated that concern.  If you have a St. Bernard or Great Dane it might be another story, but the folks at SimpliSafe have work-arounds for such situations.  By the way, the motion detectors cannot be easily defeated by people.  I have tried to do so myself and have failed.I have been very positively impressed by the folks who own and operate SimpliSafe.  One of the primaries responded to an e-mail I sent him on a Sunday afternoon, and my posts to the company website have similarly been answered quite promptly.  Incidentally, if anything goes wrong with your system, I understand you can return it within 60 days.  I know I will not be doing that.If there is a \"downside\" to SimpliSafe, it is that the sensors are currently limited to door/window entry, panic, and motion detection.  The alarm itself is 85 decibels and goes off within your premises, is certainly loud but not ear-shattering.  It seems management is working on a louder alarm, but I would like to see glass-break sensors and a weather proof, external alarm.  Still, for the price you will pay, this system is well worth it, and provides exceedingly good home security for most purposes.Update:  March 1, 2012.  Since writing this review some time ago, I am pleased to note that Simplisafe has added different types of sensors to its list of options and that it is developing glass-break and smoke detectors.  Loud outdoor sirens are also available.  And, internet/cell access to your system has been added, along with a beefed-up central unit.  Monitoring fees remain low, depending upon the options you elect.  Whenever I am out of town and leave my home, I feel exceedingly secure knowing that the Simplisafe system is in place.Update:  March 31, 2013.  I remain very enthusiastic about my Simplisafe system.  The company continues to grow, but customer service remains excellent, and more products are in the pipeline.  I just purchased a smoke detector for my home, and glass break detectors are under development.  Carbon monoxide, water, and freeze detectors are available at this time.  By the way, the batteries literally last for years without needing replacement.", "Date": "May 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "An easy alternative to the big guys", "Author": "M. Fiske", "ReviewID": "R2G105PU28GJ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my SimpliSafe system a few weeks ago directly from Simplisafe.com.  I opted for two extra door monitors and one motion sensor.  I evaluated a number of options but had it narrowed down to SimpliSafe & InGrid.  I chose SimpliSafe because of InGrid's monthly monitoring fee.The comprehensive instructions provided made set-up a breeze; I was done in under thirty minutes.  The system works great, hasn't yet had a false alarm (though I know they are unavoidable), and is easy to use regardless of whether you use the provided key fob to arm/deactivate the system.The system is \"smash and bash\" resistant unlike oh-so-many other out of the box solutions out there, meaning even if someone comes in and smashes the keypad unit next to the door, the (hopefully hidden) base unit will still alarm and contact the monitoring center.Additionally, all components have battery backup, it doesn't require a phone line or internet connection and - perhaps best of all - you aren't forced into signing up for monitoring service.  If you do opt into the monitoring, it is a very low rate relative to the other guys ($15/month) and uses it's own cellular connection to the monitoring service.There are, however a few minor cons:-The provided door sticker looks a bit \"Fisher Price.\" I ended up buying an ADT alarm sticker off eBay to serve as a deterrent.-The base unit voice is relatively quiet, meaning if you want to listen to the voice prompts (which aren't necessary), the base unit will need to be near the primary entry/exit point of your home.-Being spoiled by Amazon's incredibly quick shipping, my order took about five business days to arrive.  Not bad at all, but it seems like a lifetime when you spend those five days watching horror movie marathons late at night ;).", "Date": "March 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not perfect, but a strong system and good value", "Author": "selfskr", "ReviewID": "R1OZUJI58PJTZV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After resolving some initial issues, I am happy with my SimpliSafe system after a month of use.I decided to purchase this system over others because:(1) The system is cellular, with a battery back-up, so a burglar cannot disable it by simply cutting the phone line or power line.  Most other companies either do not offer cellular monitoring at all, charge extra for it and/or only offer it as a back-up if the land line fails.(2)  SimpliSafe does not lock you into a monitoring contract.  You pay a monthly fee for monitoring, and you can cancel the service whenever you want without penalty.  Most of SimpliSafe's competitors require you to sign at least a three year contract.(3)  Price.  SimpliSafe offers interactive monitoring for $24.95/month, which is significantly less than the competition.  With interactive monitoring you get text alerts, can change the settings on your system (customize it) through SimpliSafe's webpage and can arm or disarm the system either through the webpage or by using the Android or iPhone app (they also offer less expensive plans if you do not want the interactive features, but I chose the interactive plan).  The equipment itself is also less expensive than the competition.(4)  The system is easily expandable.  You can add additional components whenever you want.  Some other companies jack up the monthly monitoring fee when you add more components.(5)  SimpliSafe sells the system online or by the phone and you self-install it, so you don't have to deal with high pressure salespeople coming to your house.(6)  You can try out the system with no risk.  You can return it for a full refund within 60 days if you are not happy with it.I am not handy at all, but I was able to set up the system with relative ease.  Most of the components attach with adhesive tape or, if you prefer, you can mount them with screws.  I used the screws to mount an entry sensor on my garage door, since that sensor would be exposed to a lot more jostling than the others, and used the tape for all of the other units (except the smoke detector, which must be mounted with screws).  The tape has been working fine so far.  I believe the tape is 3M Command tape.  If you buy Command tape directly from 3M, the instructions tell you to firmly press on the base of whatever you are mounting for 30 seconds and then let it sit for an hour before mounting whatever you are hanging.  Although SimpliSafe's instructions do not say that, I would suggest sliding each sensor off of its base (like you would to change the battery), pressing the base firmly against the wall for 30 seconds, letting it sit for at least an hour, and then mounting the sensor.The components are wireless and I am impressed with their range.  I have a 2,400 square foot center hall colonial wood frame house. To test out the sensor range, I placed the base station (the brains of the unit) in a far corner of my house on the second floor.  It was able to \"hear\" the entry sensors from every other location in the house, including the basement and garage.I had cellular connection issues when I first got the system.  T-Mobile is SimpliSafe's default cell provider.  The T-Mobile coverage map showed that some areas near my house had excellent cellular reception, but that my neighborhood had only \"satisfactory\" coverage.  In theory, \"satisfactory\" coverage should have been sufficient, but it was not.  I was able to make a connection to the T-Mobile network, but it was not reliable.  About half the time I could not access my system from the SimpliSafe webpage or app -- they would time out when attempting to access my system status.  Occasionally I would not receive texts when the system was armed or disarmed and the event log did not show every arming and disarming of the system.  I worked with SimpliSafe's customer service department (who were very responsive and helpful) to try to find a location in my house with better reception, but to no avail.  In short, I was very unhappy with the performance of the system for the first few weeks I had it.  Ultimately, SimpliSafe sent me a replacement Verizon cell module (they only recently started offering Verizon service as alternative to T-Mobile).  The Verizon coverage in my area is much more robust than T-Mobile, and the new module solved my issues -- the system now works reliably.  I receive text messages within seconds or arming or disarming the system and I am able to control the system using the Android app or the webpage.  When you put the system into test mode, it sends a test signal to the monitoring service and, unless they are inundated with real alarm calls, they will call you to let you know they received the test signal.  The service has called me within 30 seconds each time I have put the system in test mode.Although I am satisfied with the system, there are some drawbacks you should consider before purchasing:A) Unlike most of its competitors, SimpliSafe does not yet have glass break sensors which, to my mind, are an important piece of a complete home security system for the following reason:  When the system is armed in the \"Home\" mode, the motion sensors are not active so you can walk around the house without setting off the alarm (this is the standard out-of-the box setting, though you can change it).  I arm the system in Home mode at night because I have young kids who otherwise would trip the motion sensors if they woke up before me.  Therefore, while I am sleeping, my alarm only will trigger if a burglar opens a door or window that has an entry sensor.  If a burglar smashes a sliding glass door or window while my family is sleeping, he could enter the house without setting off the alarm and, if the noise of the glass breaking did not wake us, we would be completely defenseless.  Therefore, I would feel more comfortable with glass break sensors.  According to discussions on the user forum on their webpage, SimpliSafe currently is developing glass break sensors (indeed, the installation manual that comes with the system describes how to install them), but they appear to have been in development for more than 2 years and SimpliSafe has not offered a projected date when the sensors will be ready.  *UPDATE:  SimpliSafe started selling glass break sensors on February 13, 2014*B)  SimpliSafe does not have \"crash and smash\" technology.  Here's what that means:  In your standard GE Simon alarm system (the equipment used by many of SimpliSafe's competitors), the component that controls the system (the control panel) contains both the keypad that you use to arm and disarm the system and the communication device that contacts the monitoring service.  When you enter your home through a door with an entry sensor, the system gives you a certain amount of time (the entry delay) to enter your code to disarm the system before an alarm signal is sent to the monitoring service.  If an intruder is able to destroy the control panel during that entry delay period, the system would not send an alarm signal to the monitoring service and the police would not be dispatched This is referred to as a \"crash and smash\" because the intruder \"crashes\" into your home and then \"smashes\" the control panel before it sends an alarm.Some of SimpliSafe's competitors (such as Frontpoint) solve this problem with what they call \"crash and smash\" technology.  The \"crash and smash\" technology works by sending a signal to the monitoring service the moment any sensor is tripped. If you enter your code during the entry delay, the control panel sends an \"all clear\" signal to the monitoring service.  If, on the other hand, the monitoring service receives no signal from your system at the end of the entry delay period, it assumes that the control panel was destroyed and treats the lack of an \"all clear\" signal as an alarm.SimpliSafe does not offer this \"crash and smash\" technology, so if an intruder trips a sensor when entering your home but then destroys the communicator during the entry delay period, the system does not contact the monitoring service and police are not dispatched.  However, SimpliSafe has attempted to reduce the likelihood of this scenario by separating the communicator (the base station) from the keypad.  Because they are separate components, you can place the base station in a location where the intruder is unlikely to find it during the entry delay (the base station goes dark and silent during the entry delay so as not to give away its location).  Destroying the keypad will not do the intruder any good because the separate base station will still send a signal to the monitoring service at the end of the entry delay.There are ways you can make the SimpliSafe system even less prone to a \"crash and smash.\"  For instance, you could put the base station in a locked room or cabinet, which would reduce the likelihood that an intruder could get to the base station during the entry delay.  Also, you can set certain sensors to trigger the alarm instantly (with no entry delay) if tripped.  Therefore, you could put the base unit in a room where every point of entry is armed with either an entry sensor or motion sensor set to instant trigger (note that this only would work if the intruder did not first trip a sensor with an entry delay, because once a sensor with an entry delay is tripped, the instant trigger on any other sensor is disabled).  Both of these setups only would work if the room/cabinet in which you want to locate the base station has a power outlet and cell reception.In addition, the base station has a blue light that, under the factory settings, glows when the system is armed (the light goes off when a sensor is tripped).  I changed the settings to disable the blue light on the theory that the light could give away the location of the base station to a burglar who cases the house before he tries to break in.  Similarly, an intruder only will be looking for the separate base station to smash if he knows you have SimpliSafe.  Therefore, you should not advertise that you have the system by putting SimpliSafe signs and stickers in your yard and windows.  Rather, you can, as I did, buy a yard sign for a different security company off eBay.  Likewise, since SimpliSafe uses its own proprietary equipment, the components look different than any other security system.  A burglar that has done his homework will recognize that you are using SimpliSafe if he gets a good look at the components.  Therefore, to the extent possible, you should attempt to mount the sensors in locations where a burglar will not be able to get a good look at them when he is casing the house (I realize this is difficult to do with entry sensors placed on windows or sliding doors).  Also, since the SimpliSafe logo is on the keypad, it makes sense to avoid mounting the keypad in a location where a burglar can easily see it from outside the house.Keep in mind that the \"crash and smash\" technology offered by others is not foolproof -- it only works if you design your system properly.  Say, for instance, the control panel is installed near your front door and there is a window near the door.  If you do not have an entry sensor and glass break sensor for that window, or if you do not have a motion sensor that would detect movement in the area between the window and the control panel, an intruder could enter through the window and smash the control panel without ever triggering a sensor, thereby defeating the crash and smash technology.  To take advantage of smash and crash technology, you need to carefully design your system to minimize the possibility that an intruder could get to your control panel without triggering a sensor.All things equal, I think I would have preferred a system with crash and smash technology.  But all things are not equal -- the systems that offer that technology are much more expensive and/or require a long-term contract.Having said all of that, it is worth noting that crash and smash technology (or the lack thereof) only is an issue if you are dealing with more sophisticated burglars who, knowing you have an alarm system, break in anyway on the theory that they can disable the system.  Most burglars probably are not that sophisticated and may just move on to another house if they see you have an alarm, so installing any alarm (or, at least, making a burglar think you have an alarm), whether it has crash and smash technology or not, may well deter a majority of burglars.C)  Although SimpliSafe has been saying they will offer video surveillance \"soon\" for more than two years now, they currently do not offer it and, in light of their inability to meet previous target release dates, there is no reason to expect they will anytime in the foreseeable future.  Therefore, if integrated video monitoring is a priority for you, look elsewhere.  That said, you can buy stand-alone web access video cameras that will record video whenever they detect motion (look up Foscams, for instance), so you can easily equip your home with a video monitoring system even though SimpliSafe does not offer it.  The separate cameras are not ideal because they will not arm and disarm with the security system and the monitoring service will not have access to them in the event of an alarm, but if all you want is the ability to see what it going on in your home when you are notified of an alarm, they will do the job.Before ordering SimpliSafe, I recommend that you read through the comments in the user forum on SimpliSafe's webpage.  Some owners do not like certain features of the system that I do not find problematic.  For instance, if you leave one of the entry sensors open when you leave the house, the system will tell you a sensor is open, but then will arm the rest of the sensors.  So, in theory, your system could be armed even though your front door is wide open.  Also, if one of your sensors is open when you attempt to arm the system, it will announce that a sensor is open, but it does not identify which one.  I do not have an issue with either of those features, but some owners really dislike them.  By reading the owner comments, you will get a better sense of whether this system will fit your needs.  Incidentally, I give SimpliSafe a lot of credit for their openness.  They allow all comments -- both positive and negative -- on their online forum and do not take down ones that are critical.  Try to find another alarm company that allows its customers to speak so freely on its webpage.I looked at several other companies before choosing SimpliSafe.  Frontpoint was the runner-up.  They also offer cellular service, self-installation, no contracts and a 30 day return period, but both the equipment and the monitoring service are considerably more expensive (they do offer a substantial discount on the equipment if you sign up for 3 years).  Safemart also offered most of the options I wanted and their monitoring prices were more reasonable (though still more than SimpliSafe), but their equipment was much more expensive.  Others like Protect America and Life Shield require you to sign a contract and charged much more for cellular monitoring.  As far as I can tell from their (deliberately?) confusing webpage, ADT does not offer primary cellular monitoring, only cellular back up.  ADT also requires you to sign a contract and they are not at all transparent about pricing.  In order to even get a quote, you have to subject yourself to one their sales people.Note that most of these other companies are selling the same hardware -- different versions of GE's Simon security system -- so the only real differences between the companies are their monitoring/pricing plans, installation (DIY vs. professional) and customer service.  SimpliSafe, by contrast, uses its own proprietary equipment.  In my opinion, SimpliSafe's equipment looks less sturdy and professional than the GE equipment, but I certainly am not going to pay more for aesthetics.If you decide to order, discount coupon codes are available online.  Just run a Google search for SimpliSafe coupon codes.In sum, although SimpliSafe does have some shortfalls and may not be right for everyone, it would appear to be one of the best value propositions in the home security market.", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best, Affordable Home Alarm System", "Author": "Wise Shopper!", "ReviewID": "R1HL6AP9U1DMXS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used to install alarm systems for ADT.

However, the base station continued blinking signalling entry problem; that was finally resolved when HOME was pressed, rearming the system.

I got a nice discount on my condo insurance - and simplisafe sent me the certificate that I needed to get the credit within just a few hours.The system gives me piece of mind - especially when I am by myself. The options are simple - so you aren't going through a million steps to get to what you need. Thankfully, we have never had a burglar, but we did have an instance where I mistakenly armed the alarm and had someone stopping by the house who had a key, but not a code to the alarm. In that instance, the system worked just as it should have. The alarm sounded, the call was made to us - which we missed - and the police came because they were unable to reach us!  It's nice to see that everything worked just the way you would have liked to see it.The customer service at Simplisafe has also been great.

I am going to activate the interactive monitoring today that way I have tested the full system and if it is still bad I can still return it within the 60 day window.Also, the superior customer service that others speak of, I have not experienced.  For example, I called with an issue today, and waited on hold 11 minutes before deciding to hang up.  I then called back and pressed \"1\" for sales, wondering if at least the sales line would pick up as it is a Sunday.  Of course, someone picked up immediately in sales.  I then got a \"mini-lecture\" from the sales rep about how there were other people waiting and I needed to \"wait my turn\" because it was a weekend and they were short-staffed, even though my intention was not to cut in line.  Kind of demeaning to be treated that way as a customer!  Don't advertise that you have weekend customer service support if you don't have enough people to provide customer service!Anyhow: The pros:1) No contract for monitoring service. ( I personally have not activated the monitoring service because I was having false alarms with a motion sensor and wanted to get them sorted out before i was linked up to police dispatch and was charged a fee for the police coming out for a false alarm.  However, given my interactions with \"customer service\", I'm not sure I'll be keeping the system)2) You can add components such as a smoke detector, carbon monoxide detector, extra door sensors and motion sensors, etc.  My system came with one motion sensor and I purchased 2 more, plus a smoke detector3) If you aren't good with tools, most of the devices can be stuck to the wall with adhesive.  I only had to drill my smoke detector into the ceiling.  All of my motion sensors and entry sensors are up with the adhesive.3) Rates for monthly monitoring are lower than other companies such as ADT4) you can take the system with you if you move, unlike others which remain wired into the houseThe cons:1) The keypad doesn't light up at night, so if it's dark coming in the house you can't see what numbers you are pressing.2) If there is an alarm sounded, the alarm comes from the base system and not the keypad.  It would be nice if they put the alarm in the keypad so the burglar would try to smash that and not go on a hunt for the base system, which is sounding the alarm but is also the device that sends out the call to dispatch.3)  The motion detectors are large and clunky looking, so are the door and window sensors.4) Customer service is not open on Saturdays.  They are open Sunday through Friday, daytime hours.5) The system itself is kind of pricey I feel, for the quality of the actual product.  It has kind of a Fischer-Price feel to it.  However, they are still cheaper than ADT.  I spent about $350 total: $259 for the middle-level system which came with 4 entry sensors, 1 motion sensor, a base, and a keypad.  I then added for about an additional $89 2 more motion sensors (1 motion sensor for a whole house was not enough in my opinion- I think the package should come with 2), and a smoke detector.  I would not be as annoyed about the price if the system worked flawlessly and customer service wasn't as rude, but I digress.  It's still cheaper than others.6) I downloaded the app for my smart phone in anticipation of using it with interactive monitoring.  However, the app has quirks too- it tells me my mobile device is not connected to the internet, even though I have 4 bars and full 4g access.  When I asked about this when I was placing the 2nd half of my order, I was told \"Make sure your phone has internet access.\"  I explained to the woman that all my other apps were working fine and she didn't really know what to tell me.

I often find people who review products on a regular basis to just be incredibly inept and bratty, so if you think that also, this is the review you should read.I am a very new customer to Simplisafe 2, having only bought the system about 15 days ago. I had been looking for an alarm system for my NYC apartment after suffering a burglary last summer. After searching online for an effective but inexpensive system I stumbled upon Simplisafe. It was initially appealing because not only was the cost reasonable, but it allowed for an easy installation too. I don't have a phone line set up because I just use my cell anyway and I figured a wireless system would be much easier and cheaper to set up for that reason. I'd heard about how many popular alarm companies up-charged in the installation process and was hoping to avoid that. Simplisafe looked very promising after reading a ton of positive reviews on amazon. Even the poor reviews didn't seem too alarming as I noticed many were complaints really due to the customer's ineptitude - not Simplisafe. I called Simplisafe to ask them a few questions of my own before ordering and was content with their responses. The only thing that worried me was that Simplisafe is not liable if you suffer a burglary and the armed system does not respond - so you can't blame them if your system doesn't work properly for any reason outside of their warranty. Their reason being because it is a DIY (do-it-yourself) system, they cannot guarantee that the system was properly installed. I figured this might be a big problem if I ever wanted to sue Simplisafe for stolen possessions, but I figured based on reviews that if it was installed correctly to begin with, it wouldn't be an issue, plus I have renter's insurance. I was a bit skeptical about getting a DIY system because I didn't really know much about them and didn't know anyone who had one but I thought given the money I would save, the ease with which other reviewers said it was to install and what seemed like a sound system, I would at least try the system because of the 60 day money back guarantee.Just like many reviews said, the package came very quickly (about 2 days) and I installed it with no problems. The instructions were straightforward and I spent the 3-day practice mode testing the alarm to make sure sensors, etc worked and that the alarm went off when it was supposed to. I got the system on the heels of a 5-day vacation which I figured would be a great practice/trial run. Even though it's more expensive I signed up for the $25/month interactive monitoring package which allows you to have online access via computer or cell phone of your account where you can arm/disarm the system as well as check the status of the alarm and review time-stamped logs of when the alarm was disarmed/armed and by who etc. I thought it was a great feature and since there is no obligation/contract, I knew that I could switch the plan to the cheaper basic $15/month monitoring plan when I returned from my trip. The online account worked great and was very easy to use.However, when I returned home from my vacation, I opened the door ready to disarm the alarm and nothing happened. The keypad stated that it was in \"away mode\" still but it had not recognized that I'd opened the door. I promptly closed the door and reopened it and still nothing happened. I then tried to press \"off\" on the keypad and enter my code, but after entering it, it would do nothing and go back to saying \"away mode.\" I'd come back home late from my trip and as I live in an apartment, did not want to set off the alarm and disrupt the neighbors, but reluctantly decided to purposely set if off by walking in front of the motion sensor. Again, nothing happened! Outraged that my alarm system wasn't triggering, I called the monitoring station to find out if they knew what was up. Since they don't work for Simplisafe they could not help me with this technical issue and advised I try using the keychain sensor, but that didn't work either. I even tried my trusty online account but it too stated that it could not confirm the status of my alarm and timed out. Simplisafe does not have any tech support after normal business hours so I had no one to call about this. I couldn't believe that after all that testing and double checking, that it didn't work when it actually needed to. So I'm stuck with a system that is literally stuck on away mode and have yet to figure out how to disarm it. My only guess is that perhaps its malfunctioning because of the heat. It was sweltering in my apartment when I came home, but if that's all it takes to keep the system from working properly - that's not going to fly.  I've heard of other customers getting faulty alarms but never for this reason so you can add this one to the list.I'm calling them tomorrow to request a full refund. Unless they can give me a decent explanation for why the system and all its sensors did not work after only 5 days of the system being active, I cannot in good faith rely on this system to protect my home and possessions. It's just not reliable and I've really lost confidence in the system.For those who were curious about Pros and Cons...PROS:Very easy to install and delivery was fast - everything was correct and the extra units I ordered were there.The sensors were easy to mount and I made a few mistakes so I was glad to have extra 3M strips in the package.The interactive monitoring online account was easy to use, very straightforward and made it easy to adjust settings, check status away from home and set the alarm. I loved the log that told you who and when the alarm was armed or disarmed to the minute. And the texts to my phone with these alerts came in immediately so I knew I could leave the house and get constant alerts. If you assigned a name to each code you programmed, it would tell you who actually armed or disarmed the alarm which was cool.When I initially called to inquire about Simplisafe, the gentleman on the phone was nice and had enough patience to answer the page-long questions I had about the system before purchasing. He never pressured me once to buy right away and even suggested using a more basic package based on my needs instead of trying the up-sell approach.When my system failed and I called the monitoring service, even though they couldn't help me because it was a tech issue, they answered on the 2nd ring so it was good to know that if you needed to contact them for any reason, they're a phone call away (I called at approx 11:30pm EST)CONS:Keypad has a backlight for the screen but NOT the buttons - i thought this wouldn't be a big deal, so what turn on a light, but when you're hands are full its a little annoying to have to put stuff down, turn on the nearest light and then hurry to enter your code.The Motion Sensor is not a motion sensor - its a heat sensor. This makes a huge difference if you don't have central air or something - if the temperature rises a lot in your apartment (uhh like in the summer...when I would argue most burglaries occur) chances are this thing won't trigger properly. It also doesn't have a light on it to tell you when it actually detects something like most motion sensors do. The only way you would know if it was working properly is by putting it in test mode and having the base station tell you when the motion sensor was triggered.No 24hr tech support - This would have been nice in my situation. I don't blame the monitoring company for not being able to help with my tech issues - that's really SimpliSafe's job and they should have at least one 24hour support service - phone, live chat, SOMETHING!Sensor Naming feature does not work the way you think it will. Yes if you have the more expensive monitoring plan you can name each sensor whatever you want using the online account. But if any one of them triggers the alarm, the keypad still can't tell you that same name you programmed- it will still say sensor 1 or whatever. I'm not sure if the dispatch people could tell you though, I have not had a chance to try that.The free keychain sensor gift is really bulky and I would not put it on my keychain for that reason. The WORST part about the keychain is that Simplisafe advertises it as an easy way to arm and disarm your alarm. However, when you press the off button it actually turns the alarm off WITHOUT asking you for your code first. Which means if I LOST the keychain and someone else tried to get access to my apartment, they could turn the alarm off without needing anything else! That's incredibly dangerous! It also keeps the owner from having the chance to type in the silent alarm code to contact dispatch if a burglar is already in your home. The owner would have to use a panic button in order to get help which may be difficult if someone has a gun to your head watching your every move... just sayingThey do not hold themselves liable if your alarm system does not trigger properly during a real burglary. This is because its a DIY system and even though they have that \"3-day practice mode\" and the \"test mode\" feature that allows you to check if dispatch is receiving signals from your base station, they still will not give you any monetary compensation if the system fails. Unless of course fault can be found in something they cover with their 3-year warranty - like a broken base station or something. So I would still rely on good home/renter's insurance if you're looking for monetary replacement of stolen goods.I gave this product 2 starts because I know 1 star is the worst and I honestly loved the concept and thought they had made vast improvements as a response to poor reviews from their first Simplisafe system. Also because I haven't had a chance to talk to the Tech team about my issue I don't want to rule out the possibility this system failure was somehow my fault.", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Peace of Mind and User Friendly!", "Author": "Jay", "ReviewID": "R2DBXRO5EUHIIG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just installed my Simplisafe system in about an hour!  I spent about 3 months looking at different alarm companies, but ultimately chose this one and bought it from their website directly.  I think a lot of the negative reviews on here are BS.  This system has been reviewed on Amazon since 2009 and 10 of the 14 one star reviews were written in the last 3 months.  I purchased this system for two reasons:1.  It cost only $411 up front and I own it. No lease, etc. (11 door and window sensors, 2 motion sensors, and 3 remotes)2.  No monthly contract.  I got the $25/mo plan so I can control it from my smartphone.I opened the box and planned where to put each sensor.  They installed easily on each of my windows and doors.  Just peel and stick, and for the record, they stick very well! I tried to remove one to reposition it, and it was not easy.  I installed a motion sensor in my garage and one in the middle of my house.  I placed them about 7 feet off the floor and they pick me up every time I enter the room.  I have a 50lb dog and was afraid of false alarms.  I crawled on my hands and knees all over the house and never set it off.  The setup on the website was extremely user friendly.  I was able to adjust the volume and duration of the alarm, label each sensor so I know which has been breached, and choose if I want the sensors to alarm immediately or give time to enter my PIN code. I am even able to open my windows about 1 inch to allow my evap cooler to work without triggering an alarm.  If someone tries to open the window any further, the alarm will activate (about 2 inches).The alarm system uses T-Mobile to send a wireless signal to the alarm company.  The only problem for some customers could be a poor cellular signal in their area.  I checked the T-Mobile coverage map prior to purchasing my alarm and my area has excellent coverage.  I would recommend doing the same.  I have sent 6 test alarms to the monitoring company so far and each time I received a text message and a phone call in about 20-30 seconds indicating they received my test.  Their plans range from $15-$25/month.  I chose the $25 plan.  I can monitor my alarm status and activate/deactivate it from my Android phone wherever I am.  I receive a text message every time the alarm is turned on, turned off, breached, or if my motion sensors detect movement.  My alarm base also chimes each time a door or window opens.  This is really nice to make sure my dog does not run away if I don't close my door tightly and it blows open, etc.  I can even set \"secret alarms\" to notify my phone of movement but not call the alarm company.  I used this feature in my garage, so I know if someone walks in there but I don't want the police dispatched.I will briefly explain how the system works, for those who aren't sure.  When the alarm is in \"Away\" mode:  When a entry or motion sensor is breached, the keypad will beep quietly until you enter your PIN. The base unit which contains the cellular unit remains quiet.  If you fail to enter the PIN code within 30 seconds (you can adjust the delay on their website)the alarm base will activate the siren and immediately alert the alarm company.  The alarm company will call you and ask for a password to make sure you are okay.  If you do not answer the phone or give the right password, they will call the local police.  If the base unit is damaged prior to the 30 second entry period, no alarm will be sent to the alarm company.  Because of that, I hid the base out of sight and deactivated the light to buy some time.  After the 30 seconds, they can smash it but the police are still coming.  \"Home\" mode works the same way except it disables motion sensors to allow you to walk around the house.Simplisafe also recently added smoke detectors ($30) and carbon monoxide detectors ($50) to their options.  I plan on buying one of each in the near future to alert the fire dept of problems when I'm not home.  So far, I am very pleased with this purchase.  It gives me peace of mind when I'm away and when I'm asleep.  I have not been able to trigger a false alarm yet, but I will update if I experience any problems.  If I had to think of anything negative, it would be the keypad.  It looks a little outdated, but I can live with that.UPDATE - I just installed my smoke detector.  It was very easy to add to my system.  I just logged in and typed in the serial number.  I pushed the test button and received a call within 15 seconds from the monitoring company informing me they received my test.  I am still very happy with this system.  I have not had any false alarms and every test I have done has elicited a phone call within seconds.

I dumped Frontpoint because I was tired of paying the expensive monitoring cost.I bought the Simplisafe after hearing endorsements from Dave Ramsey and Clark Howard.  Ordering was easy, and the system seemed like a good value.  I received the system promptly after ordering.When I opened the box, I was amazed at how large the door/window sensors were compared to any other security system I have seen.  They are huge, and at least 4 times larger than the sensors I had with my Frontpoint system.  After hanging them, my wife complained about how they looked, especially on our mahogany finished front door.  Thankfully, they are affixed with removable 3M adhesive strips, so when we decided to return the system they came off easily.The other hardware complaint I had from the start was the small, hard to read screen, on the keypad.  I had to start wearing reading glasses a few years ago, and I definitely need them to read this screen.  Still, this didn't seem to be a deal breaker at first, but was annoying as we used the system for several weeks.Despite the criticism I mentioned, my wife and I initially thought we could live with the Simplisafe System. The first couple of days, while the monitoring company considered us in \"practice mode\" went fine.  It was when we went live that the problems with false alarms started.I positioned the motions sensor in the exact same location that i had the motion sensor with the Frontpoint system.  The first day we put the Simplisafe system in \"away mode\" we got an alarm.  I was hours away from the house, and my wife was miles away at her work.  The police were dispatched, and they found no evidence of foul play.  The \"pet friendly\" motion sensor was either set off by our 17 pound dog, or by temperature fluctuations as the air conditioner turned on and off.  The police gave us a warning saying we'd get fined if this happened a couple more times.I repositioned the motion sensor further from air conditioning ducts, and higher so the pet wouldn't trigger it, but once again we got another false alarm.  I told the monitoring company not to dispatch the police even though I wasn't 100% sure we didn't have a break in.  When I got home, it was obviously another false alarm.  We had a couple more false alarms even though I kept moving the motion detector to try to prevent false triggers.  False alarms from the motion detector were the final deal breaker for me.Pros:1. Easy to set up2. relatively inexpensive3. low cost monitoring4. good customer support: returned system with 60 day window with no questions asked.Cons:1. Too many false alarms from motion detectors2. Keypad screen small and difficult to read.3.

The glue helps with the placement and holding of the wireless magnets and sensors while you are mounting the sensors with the screws.  The instructions are pretty clear and the only problems I had was with the size of the screws being very small and not easily handled as well as removing the covers to find the screw mounting holes.  Both not a big issue.  i purchased extra sensors and had to go thru one more step so the base station would recognize the sensors.  Again not a big issue the instructions are good.  For those of you that want a system that isn't monitored.  The only issue I ran into in the beginning is that before I signed up for monitoring the base station blinked and an error showed that there was no monitoring.  I read the instructions and found no way to turn that off.  The alarm still worked as far as I know but you would have to call to find out if the error could be turned off.

The system worked well in that the siren went off and scared the burglars away. The sensors work well and can be removed easily when the job is done. The phone support staff were excellent to work with.During the first 30 seconds of triggering the alarm, no signal is sent.Once the siren goes off the alert has been sent. If the alarm is unplugged or destroyed during that 30 second time period no alarm is sent.Our burglars destroyed the base station 1 minute after the siren went off.

You can also set the system on instant mode and there will be no delay. Also, during the first three days that the system is up and running it is in a test period and the company won't call anyone if the alarm goes off.

I wasn't able to get the call but my wife cell was also on the account. She wasn't a primary contact so they sent the police...

Our system tripped inexplicably and since Simplisafe could not reach us, they sent the police to our house. The police found no evidence of break-in. The next day we received word of this through relatives on our Simplisafe call list who took the emergency call from Simplisafe in the middle of the night. Since we had no clue what could have triggered the alarm, we then called Simplisafe and had them disable the call-police feature until we could get home and sort things out. Of course, this defeated the purpose of buying the security system in the first place, but we feared multiple false alarm calls to the police, which come with increasingly expensive fines in our city.Simplisafe could not explain the false alarm, but one of the possibilities they mentioned was a mouse. This came as a surprise since a mouse is far lighter than a 30-pound pet, and their website says an animal under 30 pounds won't trip the system. But apparently a mouse, if close enough to the motion detector, looks big and can set off the alarm. We knew that a mouse was not the problem since our motion detectors are four feet above the floor. The mystery continued.After a month back at home, with no further alarm incidents, we re-enabled the call-police feature with Simplisafe. I know it's really gross, but just this morning I have found a dead bat in a ceiling light fixture in the room adjacent to the motion detector.

Solomon", "ReviewID": "R7803ZCU6FNNW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this system and it was very excited to get it installed.  I have to say this system is so easy to set up, anyone that isn't blind should have no trouble with it.  The instructions are simple, clear, and I love the \"peel-and-stick\" process.I had my system up and running in about 10 minutes.  I haven't screwed in any of the sensors because I think the 3M tape should hold it fine.  Their smoke detector, however, only uses screws and no tape is provided for it.Disclaimer:  I didn't buy this from Amazon, but directly from SimpliSafe's website.  And that's only because Amazon didn't have all the sensors in the package I wanted.  So my setup includes:- Panic Button- Extra 105DB siren- Second motion sensor- Second key remoteI hope Amazon matches the packages on their website, since I prefer to buy from Amazon whenever I can.  But here are things I like about the system:1. It's extremely simple to use and install2. Cellular connectivity so there are no wires to install anywhere3. Monitoring service (should you use it) is relatively cheap4. The ability to create additional key codes for baby sitters, guests, etc.5. The ability to remotely configure and change your sensor set up (requires the premier monitoring service)6. Mobile app for certain phones (requires the premier monitoring service).  But the ability to arm/disarm when you're away is really nice.Now on to the some complaints about this system:1. The monitoring service left me irritated the first time I had to use them.  I was celebrating Christmas with family 7 hours away when I got the call from the monitoring center, saying my motion sensor had triggered an alarm!  I was initially upset, but realized I accidentally left one motion sensor on the kitchen counter (d'oh!).  My cats go up there all the time, so they tripped the alarm.  Yes, the motion sensors are pet friendly, but only IF you place it on a wall a few feet off the ground.  In any case, they told me they had already dispatched the police.  When I asked if they could cancel the police dispatch, they said it wasn't possible.  So here I was, 7 hours away from home, wondering if the cops were going to break down my door.  The monitoring service didn't give me any helpful information.  They said they would call me back when the cops showed up to the house, but never heard back.  Uggh.  Maybe this is the way all of them work?  I just wasn't particularly impressed.  I'm hoping the next time it works out better.2. That brings me onto my second issue. If you think there's no upsell to get you to buy their higher priced monitoring service, you haven't done your homework.  There's always an upsell!  If you want to remotely disable a sensor, you have to get the premium monitoring package.  If you want the mobile app, you have to get the premium monitoring package. etc. etc.  I still think it's cheaper than ADT and Comcast, but don't assume that there's no monthly cost.  That said, if all you want are the sensors and no monitoring, then you should be good to go.3. I really wished they had options to replace certain sensors with other ones.  Or a \"build your own bundle\" option.  I say that because the entry sensors are somewhat useless.  I doubt a burglar is going to try an open your door/window unless you leave it open.  Most often, they'll break the glass to get in, in which case the entry sensors don't do anything for you.  I wish I could trade in an entry sensor for a glass-break sensor, or a secondary keypad.  I live in Chicago where the houses are typically narrow and long, so it's nice to have a keypad for the front and rear door.  This is just a minor gripe.4. The cap for the USB key remote falls off easily.  I wish they had a better, more secure cap for this.  This is also a minor issue.Overall, I highly recommend this system.

It took minimal time to install a few door sensors, a motion detector, and multiple panic buttons and keychains (this was for a business).

The cost of the install is never actually free to have the devices I need to fully secure my home and they nickel and dime big time for every little add on. Another trick is the short period of time you have to cancel your account or make changes at the end of your contract term before auto-re-enrollment. It's a joke that ultimately meant I never purchased.SimpliSafe fits a niche that, I believe, will make them very successful in the long run. It's very easy to install and configure. The system is almost completely ready and pre-programmed out of the box and works flawlessly. The components are really light weight but seem well crafted. I assume this is due to the stick-on nature of the product. Just a note, screws are also included for mounting. So I mounted my whole system permanently. The screw lengths, though, are very short. I prefer a longer screw to attach the window and door sensors.I chose the $25.00/month plan as I like the monitoring and arming/ disarming from my phone.I just put in another order for some more components for a couple areas I forgot and can't wait to get them in.As for the reps, I made one call and the rep was very responsive and helpful and the overall experience has been awesome.I see SimpliSafe having a ton of success with its model as there is no one offering this type of comprehensive product/ service beginning to end.

Had several security companies come around and give me quotes for install of their systems. One of the more reputable local alarm companies were looking for ~$3K for hardware plus ~$2K for install plus high monitoring fees.Read various reviews and decide to go with this system. included some extra keychain remotes for family memebers(makes going in and out much easier), a few extra motion sensors, an extra keypad for the rear door, an extra alarm for outside the front door and proximity sensors for all the doors including the garage door for a total of ~$750.Also went with the basic (standard) monitoring plan. It would be nice to have the upgraded monitoring plan to personalize the system etc. But just nice to haves as they say. The basic plan of $14.99 seems to be excellent value compared to ADT etc.It seems to me the main vulnerability is if a burglar breaks in and smashes the base station before the entry alarm is triggered then you are screwed. I have increased the exit time alarm and at home entry alarm times to 2 mins (since they are not so critical), but set the entry alarm time to 30 secs.  I wouldn't use the SIMPLISAFE decals, but use ADT stickers just to make it more difficult to figure out what system you have. Also make sure the base station is well hidden.

The DROPCAMs are nice because you get basic real-time monitoring for free.The only problem I had was that 2 of the keychain remotes worked intermittently. Once I replaced the batteries they seemed to work ok. makes me wonder if their batteries are past it! Install was generally very easy. The only tricky bit was trying to find the best place to install the motion sensors to catch all burglars, but not have false alarms.

I also bought several additional Entry Sensors to fully protect my home.  This system is excellent.  It took me a couple days to get it functional, not because it is hard to install, but because I had some issues unique to my house and property that took longer to install.After four months the Simplisafe system is working fine with no problems.  Initially, I had problems installing the Entry Sensors on my casement windows.  There was not enough room for the Sensor and the magnet installation without interfering with the screen for the window.  I resolved that problem by installing the sensor between the window and the screen (screen is on the inside) on the jamb and glued \u00bd inch button magnets (purchased at the local big box DIY store) in the window frame by drilling (with a forstner bit) two \u00bd inch holes lined up with the sensor.  This worked very well and resolved that installation problem.Another problem I encountered was Entry Sensors indicating \"Open\" when they were closed.  After talking to Customer Service, it was determined that I had installed the magnet for the Entry Sensor on a steel door and the sensor on the jamb.  This causes the door to become magnetized and causes false alarms.  After switching the sensor to the door and the magnet to the jamb, the problem was resolved.We have had a couple instances where the system was accidentally set off and the response from the dispatch center was excellent.  We also had a situation where our granddaughter came to our house when we weren't home to drop something off and entered the wrong code.  The local Sheriff Department responded very quickly, luckily she had proper I.D. so we didn't have to bail her out of jail!!!  Point is, that if you are concerned about dispatch center response time --- I can say, by personal experience, that it is good.In conclusion, the Simplisafe Security System is an excellent product.  With 27 components in our system (4 of them in an out-building 150 feet from the house), I have had no failures to date.

It took me two hours of calling various local police and fire contacts to finally get an answer that no registration was required. In our area, I finally got an answer from the police and fire dispatch personnel. This is a very inconvenient waste of time and I am surprised that SimpliSafe doesn't already have this info documented. I was not made aware in my pre-purchase phone conversation with SimpliSafe that the cell phone service provider for their cell signal is T-Mobile. Since T-Mobile has a very poor signal in our area, I was a bit concerned. To my surprise, the signal seems to be working well. They do provide a landline phone jack on the base station to use as a backup. I do think they should be more up front about this info though.Next, everything went up very smoothly and per all the instructions. You should give yourself a good two hours to get everything installed and to document all the serial numbers of your devices. I took an extra hour to deactivate and disconnect my old ADT system. BTW, ADT requires 30 day notice of termination of services provided you are \"out of contract.\"If you are mounting any device to a textured wall (i.e. keypad, motion sensors), use the screw mounts. If the adhesive fails and you device fall of the wall, the damaged devices will probably be at your cost.I am currently in the 3 day \"practice mode\" so we can get familiar with the system before going to live Dispatch Service. Personally, I think Simplisafe should allow the user to determine when they are ready to go to the live Dispatch Service, whether it's 3 ,2 or 1 day(s). For those that have never used a security system, I think 3 days are a good idea, but for users that have had other systems, 1 day should be enough.

I also am now told that the cellular signal is weak in my area and that may be part of the problem. I wish I had known this before investing in this $400 system. Simplisafe should tell prospective customers that if the T Mobile cellular signal is weak, their system probably won't work adequately. Would not recommend this system to others unless they are sure they have a good cellular signal and live in the property where it is installed.Now that Simplisafe has incorporated Verizon cell phone service, I am happy to report that I no longer have to reboot my system after inevitable power outages. The connection did not fail even once this winter in spite of a number of ice storms.

I agree that the value is great and the concept is great.  I was sold on the concept when I bought the system.First month:First, the keychain which connects via the USB to your computer doesn't work and SimpliSafe support blames Apple for their recent Mac update.  They specifically said \"it's not our fault\" as in it's Apple's fault.  I'm in the software industry, and I can tell you that it is your job SimpliSafe to adjust to the updates even if that's a pain in the butt to do.  If you haven't kept up with the updates then apologize for the inconvenience and tell me your software development team is working on a fix, instead of telling me \"it's not our fault!\".  The first step in the instructions is the connect the keychain to your computer.  A BIG FAIL.Second, within 48 hours the keypad froze.  The screen froze and was not syncing with monitoring.  The excuse I got was \"what wall did you install it to?\".  My response \"the wall by the door I go in and out the most like instructed\".  Then the customer rep says \"is it close to a light switch?  If so, it often has this problem, just take the battery out and reboot\".  That's your solution?!?  Now, most, if not all, households probably have a light switch nearby the door you enter the house.  So now, I'm told I have to move the keypad away from the light switch which mean away from the door and to an inconvenient location.  Though I was told the light switch is 'probably' the cause but can't be sure so test it for a while and see what happens.  I pointed out there was NO mention of this pretty big fault for the system.  The customer support rep just shrug it off like \"oh well\" and not even apologized once for my inconvenience and the failure.Third, as if the first two above weren't bad enough, the worst annoyance was the customer rep's attitude and tone.  He interrupted me repeatedly, had absolutely no aptitude for being in customer service, and was downright rude and completely obvious he hated his job and just didn't give a damn how he talked to his customer.So I give it 2 stars (generously) for my first 2 days of my experience with SimpliSafe.  I sincerely hope it gets better.  If my experience becomes better with it, and I hope it does, I'd keep the system and update the review.  If not, I'll return it and downgrade my review further.Fast forward to six month:You get what you pay for.  Again, I liked the concept.  You own the system, you pay low monitoring fee.  Who wants to be stuck with 3-yr commitment with ADT?  (I used to be stuck).  Though SimpliSafe is cheaper overall you only get what you pay for.  The customer service reps are *consistently* far less professional.  Every time I talk with them they lack professionalism, they sound like they hate their job, they don't have the customer service attitude.  Every time I've talked with monitoring people, they have the \"I don't know, I'm just work for the monitoring company, I don't know details about your system\".  They do not AT ALL come across as people you can trust.  Just so slack.  The DMV treats me better than this.  Now the product itself.  The motion detector isn't what it describes on the website.  The delay from key pad to central unit happens a lot.  Sometimes the system gets stuck and you have to reboot.  It's simply not reliable.  You don't want a security system that's not reliable and works \"probably most of the time\".  So if you are looking for a reliable product with dependable service, look elsewhere.", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simplisafe2  A good idea unless it doesn't work!", "Author": "sgk1945", "ReviewID": "R1N0LLPQ6SNGBG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First I received my system and the keypad malfunctioned.  When I called customer service I found that they don't answer the phone after 3:00PM California Time.  Not too convenient.  I was close to returning the system but decided that there were so many features I liked that I would give them a chance to redeem themselves, so I had them send another keypad.  It arrived today. (They're not in a hurry to ship warranty replacement parts.)  I installed it and tested all the sensors.  I thought I was in business, so I activated my monitoring and went into test mode.....The base station did not connect to the monitoring center.  I followed instructions and relocated the base....4 times!.  It's now sitting in a window in the middle of my master bedroom.  There's no way I'm going to leave it there because it looks ugly and it would be too easy for someone to break in and smash it before the entry delay expired, but I wanted to give it the best possibility of connecting.  No joy.I tried calling customer service again but, of course, they only work on Boston time and there is no support available off hours....kind of strange for a security company.  What if I was about to leave on vacation and there was a problem?  I would have to either cancel vacation or leave without arming the system; Two bad choices.I forgot to mention, when I received my system it was just a bunch of parts thrown into a box, somewhat at random.  I suspect what they sent me was untested warranty returns.  I wonder when they receive my return, if they'll send it to someone else.I give this system 2 stars for the creative concept and affordable cost and 0 stars for customer service, quality, and reliability.I haven't totally given up but, as you can tell, I'm close to throwing in the towel.Update: 5/1/2014 I was finally able to be near my system during Sinplisafe business hours.  I ended up removing the SIM and they determined that they had the wrong number in their system.  After they corrected the error on their end everything worked.  Although I cannot improve my quality or customer service ratings, I did change my overall rating from two stars to three.On a positive note,  Tech Support did tell me that they are soon to be operating 7 days a week, still only open to 3:00 California time, but their long range plan is to be available 24/7.

I found it with SimpliSafe. I can't depend on wireless internet and Home phone connections for monitoring ( I was a former Installation Tech so I  know how easy it is to fail) so the fact that Simplisafe uses cell tower technology is what drew me on the most.  Everything can be setup in less than an hour, no matter how technically inclined you may or may not be. I brought the basic starter package because I live in a 1 bedroom apt, but it has everything that I need.Compared to competitors that I researched, they offered about the same amount of features but for a cheaper price. So far, no real complaints. the first 2-3 days after you install it, your system is in \"test\" mode so you have a little bit of time to play around with and even set it off a couple of times which doesnt alert 911. The standard Audible alarm could be louder though...If you have a large home you will def need to purchase the  louder optional audible alarm.  A day after my alarm went into \"active\"  mode, maintenance  came into my apartment to do work (even though I told them to call first because I wasn't home). My alarm immediately set off, I received a SMS Text warning that a sensor was triggered, and I received a call from Simplisafe Dispatch asking for my \"safe word\" or 911 would be dispatched. That let me know that it worked and that was great! The best thing is you can arm or disarm the alarm from a smart phone or computer, so you can be literally anywhere to control it!  I only wish that Simplisafe offered some type of video surveillance to be included with the system. I ended up separately  purchasing a cloud-based motion sensored video surveillance system called Dropcam that works great with it. Overall, great quality product, you will get \"bang\" for your buck.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "[updated] Excellent DIY home security", "Author": "Impetigo", "ReviewID": "R2C8PQ2Q04MXD0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "[Updated comments at bottom]PROS:1. SIMPLE AND EASY TO USE.  It comes with a USB memory stick/keychain that you use to easily \"transfer\" settings from your computer (when using that method, which is what I did) to the system base (the tower with the cellular transmitter).  The 3M stickers are very sticky and will have no problem securely/sturdily holding up the keypad and sensors to your wall, door, etc.  No need to use the included screws to mount them.2. CLEAN DESIGN.  The sensors, keypads, and everything is pretty well designed and reasonably attractive (albeit bulky in some cases).3. EASY TO USE.  Press \"home\" to turn it on when you want the system armed while you're at home and \"away\" when you want to turn it on when you leave the house.  Turn \"off\" to turn it off (after entering your PIN).4. WORKS AS INTENDED.  Properly situating the base station is the most important thing to do, but if you can find a good location you will have no issues with the system.  If you have a bigger house, it may be more problematic.5. CAN CONFIGURE VIA COMPUTER/MOBILE DEVICE.  Each sensor has a serial code that you can use to specifically identify the sensor (e.g. \"basement door\" or \"kitchen window\") using computer or mobile device, which comes in handy when you get alerts as you can identify which sensor was set off.6. CHEAPER MONTHLY MONITORING THAN ADT.  $15/mo for the no-frills monitoring, $20/mo to also get alerts, and $25/mo to get monitoring of other sensors (water/flood, carbon monoxide, fire, etc.).  A lot cheaper than ADT.7. NO CONTRACT LIKE ADT.8. 60-DAY RETURNS.  Despite all the cons, they do let you try it out for a full two months.  And when you call to return it they don't actually try to convince you to keep it.===CONS:1. HORRIBLE CONSTANT AUDIO \"WARNING\" MESSAGE AND FLASHING BLUE LIGHT IF NOT USING MONTHLY MONITORING.  Yes, you will hear an annoying message from the base station frequently (when turning the alarm on or off) that reminds you that you do not have monitoring set up, and thereby reminding you to get it set up to avoid hearing this stupid message.  Yeah, the thieves will hear it to upon breaking into your home.  Gee, thanks a lot SimpliSafe!  You can't turn off the audio message or the flashing.  This is a bit of a scam since you can't really use it as a stand alone system, at least, not without seeming like a joke to anyone who ever hears that message about not having monitoring set up.  2-stars off just for this, which is essentially deceptive advertising.2. BULKY ENTRY SENSORS.  They're rather large which naturally makes it more noticeable and more of an eye sore.  Also makes it somewhat difficult to install easily, depending on your specific door/window type/location/etc.  The ADT wireless sensors are definitely smaller.3. KEYPAD HAS NO INDICATOR LED LIGHT to show if the system is on/off.  How lame, no LED light (always on or flashing) to show that the system is active or not!  You have to look at the screen, which has the backlight off by default (battery powered after all) and try to read it, which is not easy to do.  What an oversight to not include a simple flashing (maybe just every 15 seconds or so like a fire alarm) LED light.  The only other way to visually see if it's on is to look at the base station \"cone\" that has a blue light that is steady to indicate that it's on (but obviously, you can't look at it except in the room where it's located).4. UP FRONT COST.  Significant up front cost (I paid over 8 hundred dollars) but it will pay itself off after 1-2 years, depending on your level of service.  This assume that the system works well.5. HAVE TO PAY MONTHLY MONITORING TO GET MOBILE ALERTS, OR ANY ALERTS (e.g. fire alarm, carbon monoxide, water sensor, etc.) OTHER THAN THE BASIC SECURITY ALERT.  So, basically you have to get monthly monitoring unless you're using only the basic security system.  No water/flood monitoring if you don't get monthly monitoring.===NOT SURE IF PRO OR CON:1. WATER SENSORS HAVE NO REPLACEMENT BATTERIES.  Not sure if it's because they're supposed to be water tight, but you can't buy replacement batteries for the water sensors from SimpliSafe (as opposed to all the other sensor batteries, including AA batteries, lol).  You have to unscrew (x4 screws) the back cover to access the inside of the sensor.===FINAL THOUGHTS: I haven't set up the monitoring yet but plan to do so in the near future and will update this review after I do so.  Hope this helps!****************************[UPDATED: 12/27/13]****************************So, I have now been using the SimpliSafe2 system for about two weeks now, after almost returning the entire system.  I figured out a few things that have made this system pretty darn good.GOOD:1. You can ask SimpliSafe (via their website forum is the easiest way) to send you an update for your system that will turn off the horrible audio warning that there is no monitoring set up (if you choose not to use that monthly service).  You can also turn off the flashing blue light on the base station.2. Monitoring via PC or smartphone/tablet (requires the $25/month monitoring plan) is super easy and useful.  I use SimpliSafe with my iPad Air, my Samsung Galaxy Note 3, and my home and work computer.  The iPad app is not optimized for tablets so I just use the smartphone version which is fine.  You can also easily use the website as well (which is what I mostly do).  Using the mobile software, which is surprisingly well designed and useful, you can check the system status (alarm off or in home/away mode) and see if there were any alarms that went off.  You can also turn it off/on using the software/website.  If an alarm went off, you can check which sensor it was, which is very useful since you can label every sensor so that you know if a water sensor in your basement went off (I bought about 10 water sensors at 20 dollars each, so not cheap but very useful) or your kitchen door or living room window entry sensor.  You do need to get the higher priced monthly monitoring but for me it has been totally worth it.  You can also get info on which PIN disarmed alarms as well along with info on when the alarms went off or were disarmed.You also can get email and/or text alerts if any alarms/sensors were triggered.  Overall, these features are the best thing about SimpliSafe.  Also, it's very useful that not only are the sensors' operational status indicated on the software/website, but it will indicate if battery status is low (so you don't need to run around the house every month checking them all).  I use about 10 entry sensors and 12 water sensors so that is very useful for me.3. Monitoring works well.  I live in a 3-story house with my base station near a window on the middle level and have had no issues with sensors around the house connecting with the base station.  When testing the system (in test mode) or when you activate the alarm, I have gotten a phone call from the monitoring company (Amcest) probably in 30 seconds or less, but definitely within a minute.  No problems in my house using the T-mobile cellular transmitter, but apparently there are other modules (AT&T;, Verizon) if you don't get good T-mobile reception.4. Sensors work well.  Entry sensors work perfectly well and the water sensors also very well.  The water sensors have \"right angle\" prongs on the bottom, and they work best when installed vertically (so that the writing on the case is upright) rather than placing it on the floor flat.  When I tested a sensor by placing the bottom horizontal part of the prong in about a couple mm of water, it went off and the alarm went off and I got email/text alerts.  If you leave it flat, there will need to be significantly higher water levels to set it off, since the horizontal part of the right angle prongs need to get in contact with water to set it off -- and that happens easily if installed upright and not easily when lying flat on a surface (not to mention it will likely end up getting water damage in the sensor).5. Well designed, both aesthetically and functionally.  Ultra simple keypad and very clean physical design of the components (sensors, keypads, etc.).  Not only easy to use (I was even able to teach my parents how to use it in only a couple minutes lol... the multiple PINs are great for that purpose) but looks professional and not like a toy like the Fortress system.6. Fire/Carbon Monoxide alarms.  I haven't set these up yet but it's nice that you can hook these up to the system to get alarms/monitoring for when you're out of the house (for fire) or in the house (for fire or carbon monoxide).7. Website message board is pretty useful.  Their customer service phone line ends at 6pm EST and is not open every day, but the website forum is pretty useful as they have at least one staff member who seems to monitor it frequently so that most questions are answered within a day usually by other users or staff.BAD (STILL): The only real negative I have to say about this system so far is that you cannot set up an alarm delay of less than 30 seconds when on \"away\" mode.  This is the mode you set up when you leave the house, and so having 30 seconds for the would-be burglar to look around the house is too long, since during that time the system is just beeping and no alerts are being sent to the monitoring center.  If they find and destroy the base station (easy for a burglar who knows how to use google to find out how large and obvious looking the base station is) then that's the end of your alarm system.  The odd thing is that you can set the delay to 1 second or even \"instant on\" (activates alarm immediately after triggere) when on \"home\" mode, but for me I would want the shorter delay for away mode since that is when there is no one at home to do anything (like call police or grab a weapon, etc.).  Hopefully they will \"fix\" that (obviously, these alarm delays are intended to cut down on unintentional alarm activations and police/fire station notifications which add up cost to the monitoring/alarm company and the users).  I would be happy with a 15 second delay at least.CONCLUSIONS: Having now tried out the SimpliSafe2 system for the past few weeks I have to say that it is a great system and the best DIY that I have seen.  I love it and can't wait for more features (especially more home monitoring features like thermostat control, etc.) to come out eventually.  So far so good!Original rating: 3/5 starsUpdated rating: 4/5 stars (would increase to 5 stars if the \"away\" mode alarm delay could be set to less than 30 seconds)****************************[UPDATE #2]****************************Apparently, the 30 second \"away\" mode alarm delay is due to an alarm regulation or standard, and you can set all entry sensors besides one to \"instant on\" even in \"away\" mode.  That actually makes sense since you have to enter the home to turn off the alarm so you wouldn't want the alarm going off every time you enter your house.  I've consequently updated my rating to 5/5 stars as this is a very nice DIY alarm system.  I ended up spending about $850 for my system (with many additional entry/water sensors and a couple extra keypads) but it's totally worth it given the functionality and quality.

I was quite impressed with what Simplisafe had to offer for the money spent.  I had at one point almost went with ADT, but after really looking into what it would cost me for both the equipment needed and the cost (at that time, would have to had signed a three year contract), it didn't take me long to decide that's not what I wanted.  I got a great package deal from Simplisafe and had everything I needed and more.What I like about their product is the option of adding sensors, detectors etc, later if needed, and of course the very budget friendly monitoring service offered.  When I went to set mine up, I called customer service to ask about a detached garage I have, and rather a sensor would work.  They told me as long as it's within 150 feet of the sensor it would work, and although from my garage door to the base station isn't nearly that far, it works like a champ. I often worried about someone entering my garage while I was away or slept, but with the 105 decibel alarm out there, I'm quite sure it will deter anyone who ventures in there.My main reason for wanting an alarm system is that I have a hearing problem, and wanted something to wake me in the event of a break in or attempt of breaking in.

I have had the service since July and have had 3 false alarms in my time with it.  The first was caused by my puppy, who was less than 8lbs at the time, who set off the motion sensors (Simplisafe claims that dogs under 25lbs will not set off the alarm.  I was never called for this (checked phone records) and neither was my secondary contact.  They called the police though, and I was fined for a false alarm fee.Second time, I accidentally set off the alarm, managed to turn it off quickly, but never received a call, though when I called Simplisafe about it, the claimed that yes, they called and yes, the cops were on their way.  Managed to nip that in the bud, whew.Third time, I had all of my motion sensors disabled since the incident with my dog.  I also do not arm the alarm unless I feel threatened.  The alarm went off when, apparently, I was in the house.  I did not hear a siren.  I did not get a call (again I checked my phone records with my provider).  They dispatched police, though I never saw them (despite being HOME?!?).

It is well made, easy to use and easy to install. I would have given them 5 stars, except I see a few things that could be improved. I still recommend this system to anyone. I replaced an older wired system I had for 10 years.1. The motion sensors are designed to be mounted in a corner, yet come with tape in the center of the back. The tape is in the wrong place. More tape in the right spots would help.2. The motion sensors need lights that show when motion is detected. I've used motion sensors for years and they all do this. It' a better way to test and determine if you or your pet will set it off.3. The key chain fob is an interesting idea but could be improved. Why not add a \"home\" button and then it can be used as a remote from your bedroom at night. And it should probably have some additional security mechanism, like a fingerprint sensor or a way to enter your code. If you lose your keys, anyone can disable your alarm by pressing a button.4. The system is easy to install but it should allow you to name your sensors so they are easier to keep track off. Like \"front door\". Otherwise you have to keep referring back to a list of your serial numbers and where the sensors are. This is a simple improvement that would help.5. It should come with 2 or 3 yard signs that are waterproof. My old system had metal signs and plastic posts. The one large cardboard sign with tape on the back won't last outside.

We liked the heads-up during order placement, that we may need police/fire permits.  Our city in SoCal costs $35 for the police, then $20 for renewal thereafter.  Also found out that many insurance companies require the MONITORING COMPANY to be UL Listed to get a discount.  SimpliSafe's monitoring company is UL Listed, and we were impressed with the UL requirements to get this type of certification.We liked the chart in the back of the booklet that let's us keep track of where we've installed the sensors, as the sensors all have serial numbers.  When the keypad, or the alarm company advises of a situation with a sensor, it will alert by serial number.  By identifying, for example, Sensor #XYZ is the \"right living room window\", the location is easily identifiable.  We will print this info on a small card to carry in our wallets to have at all times for reference.  On the larger provided chart we keep at home, we have added \"battery-type\" for each item, so when the batteries need replacement, we will know what is needed.The only negative, so far, is the need for clearer correlation between action and result on the keypad.  For example, when changing the pin, you do the procedure, but it would be nice if the keypad would say something like \"new pin successful\".  Just so you KNOW it's been accepted. There are several other steps that we would like to see a confirmation that the action worked, and you didn't make a mistake.We like the sticky tapes to adhere some items - for a temporary solution, while you're trying to determine if a certain location will work.

The screws provided are too short for drywall, so be prepared to use your own.The deciding factor was NO LONG-TERM monitoring contracts.

I was right next to my downstairs keypad when it went off and was able to punch in my code within seconds of the alarm. I didn't think I'd get a call, but another second or two later my cell rang. It was SimpliSafe calling to see if all was well. Thanks, and if that's the \"Johnny on the spot\" service I can expect every time, then I'll be with SimpliSafe for a long time and will spread the word as often as I get the chance.*I'm in a bi-level home and have my motion sensors set for away mode and supplement my door and window sensors with motion sensors on my lower level in the two wide open rooms on ground level.  Our kitchen, living, and bed rooms are on the upper level and all the windows are well off the ground so I just did a door sensor on my front door.  That's why my motion sensors were active while I was home; typically you would use the Home mode when at home and the Away mode when you go out.  We use the Away mode for both overnight and when we go out for the added benefit of having the motion sensors providing backup cover for the 2 big rooms downstairs.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Product - Not enough personel to answer questions", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "RN1ZEPMK78KL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Everything out of the box worked well.

I've already added a few myself, and you don't have to pay any extra fees, other than the price of the sensor.  That's great!It's also fairly simple to setup and to manage, and it's all done at your own convenience.It works!  I've been using it for a few weeks now and nothing unexpected yet.Cons:A small downside, and I don't know if this is available anywhere else either, is that I would've liked to be able to create my own modes.  It has home, and away.  But maybe I'd also like a vacation mode, or work mode (I work at home), where I can create more customized sensor setups for that situation.  I've heard they are constantly working on new features though, so I'm hoping I'll see more of that type of thing in the future.I'd also like to see some type of video offering. If I wanted to put a camera up it would be great to have the option as part of the security package.I've had it for a few weeks now, and although the dog did keep triggering the motion sensor despite being just around 30 lbs, everything else is as expected.  I'm not sure it's the sensor's fault though, he's not allowed on the couch but I can see it happening while I'm out.  That would bring him much closer to the sensor and the manual clearly states that it needs some distance even for smaller animals.Conclusion:The downsides I've experienced are negligible.

Wow, is this an exception!  A true \"plug and play\" system, you literally just stick up the components and turn it on.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!The only little negative (that I expect is unavoidable for a self-installed system of any type) is that the instruction booklet is a tiny bit frustrating despite how nicely it is laid out and illustrated, but if you have questions you can call and speak to a friendly, knowledgable, caring customer support agent who enunciates and listens well to get over any little hurdles.  As an example of the booklet's shortcoming, the very front page says to put your key fob USB into your computer for a quick start and avoid the booklet altogether.  On the LAST PAGE of the booklet it says you need to insert the fob into the base unit to sync it with your system before putting it in the computer.  Yeah, it doesn't work if you don't so we didn't get the joy of using the quick start and were pretty frustrated to learn why on the very last page of the booklet.  But, again, that's nitpicking - please do not let this deter you!!!Also, consider your cell tower availability for T-Mobile or Verizon.  We live in a rural area where coverage for those networks is spotty so we rely on the landline.  However, when we reported a lack of cell service with T-Mobile, SimpliSafe sent us a Verizon chip (with fabulous instructions on how to replace the other) overnight for free.  It seems to be working better, but, again, whether this is an issue for you is cell coverage dependent and not a reflection on SimpliSafe.Usually I wait to review a product until I've used all its features, but I didn't want to wait until someone broke into the house and the police came to review the product; hopefully, that will never happen.  I have 100% confidence that the alarm system will do its thing.  We set it every night to Home and every time we leave to Away.

It required a phone line and was a pain for the technician to install .. all the worthwhile functions ( adding new sensors etc. ) were tied up so that I would have to pay crazy prices to get the system modified. Also, I asked him what would happen if a burglar ripped the system off the wall or just cut the wires; all he could do was shrug.We since moved to a new house and I was determined to not use a system that was hard to extend and which was easy to disable.The new home had an older wired system. I researched home automation, with the idea of adding a new control panel that was GSM based and trying to patch the existing wired sensors into that, then hooking it all into my burgeoning home-automation system. After a while, I realized I was not going to get anywhere with that; although I'm fairly technical, I'm not an electrician and I was probably in for a steep learning curve.After a lot of research, we settled on Simplisafe and as I've only just installed it, I can't speak to the dispatch center's reliability, but my experience with regard to how well designed this system is speaks to me of a well-thought out plan for home security.Here are the pros and cons:pros:+ Once the system is installed you can add sensors very cheaply ( ~$30 for a motion sensor )+ it is easy to integrate new sensors into your system.+ The base station does not need to be on your home network+ Setup is simple , just plug the supplied usb fob into your computer, reconfigure, and plug it into the base station and it does the rest.+ Once initial setup is complete, configuration that you do on the web-based dashboard is sent via GSM to the base station so you can configure as needed.+ You can direct and control responses on a sensor-by-sensor basis.+ GSM based, battery backup; you can put the base station wherever you want+ Easy ( and cheap ) to install backup sirens ( I used a ladder to install my backup siren, so it'd be hard to pull it down )+ Set up multiple email/sms alerts ( both my wife and I get notifications )+ Smartphone apps available ( with top-tier subscription plan )+ Very mobile; you can reconfigure your sensor \"field\" at the expense of only the sticky strips needed to mount them. For renters, this is a dream; you can install a security system that is independent of the landlord and which you can easily take down and re-install in your new place in minutes if you move house.Cons ( a short list )- I wish it had z-wave integration.. I'd bet a shunt could be written to parse notification emails and route appropriately via a z-wave API.- I think the subscription plan should be a flat fee with all the bells and whistles at a single intermediate price. Currently, the subscription is billed at 3 tiers. The top tier is still very competitive when you look at the other players in the market.- Honestly, I can't think of any other downsides to the system, you pay up-front but the monitoring prices are very competitive. Once installed, you can extend the system component-by-component.Summary:Like I said, I only just installed this so I have no experience with the long-term operational effectiveness. I'll return with an update after an appropriate period of time. My past experience with security companies is that as soon as you have paid them the installation fee and signed the contract, you are just an inconvenience to them. I've found simplisafe to be proactive and enthusiastic about engaging with their customers. The cynical side of me understands that they have a business in selling more sensors and replacing batteries ( not to mention holding on to the monitoring contract ) but at least that means that customer-centric attitude is baked in at a corporate level.Technically speaking, I can tell this system was designed in a smart way; it's modular, easy to use, extensible and comprehensive.Based on my initial experience, I'd heartily recommend to anyone.", "Date": "May 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "I'm returning the whole thing after 2 weeks", "Author": "Willie Williams", "ReviewID": "R330X1I5ZTL1KC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Paid over $400 for the system and it never worked correctly.

After speaking with many \u201cname brand\u201d security companies our frustrations emerged immediately.  Not only were their monthly service fees over priced but the systems they wanted to install were all hard wired and required a 3 year contract.

Here are my pros and cons:PRO's-customer service was outstanding in answering questions both before purchase and after with installation/placement/usage questions.-very simple to install.  I did not use adhesive backing at all for any elements, I used screws for all elements of the system and it took me about two hours which included fabricating a mount in the attic by the attic vent for an extra siren. (I had 3 motion sensors/4 entry sensors/a smoke alarm/extra siren/keypad)-system test after installation was simple/website account set-up was straightforward/activating monitoring and using apps was easy.-system is very flexible and perfect for a second home. I will know via text and e-mail within ten seconds if there is an alarm activation or problem regardless of where I am as long as I have my cell phone and cell service.-I can set up specific passwords for service people to enter house then change those passwords when they are done, remotely, and I will know every time they disarm/arm the system.-I can change a multitude of settings from any computer/ipad/phone at any time in addition to arming/disarming system.-perfect for a second home.CON's-I personally would not install any sensors using the tape mount that is provided. Seems like in just a matter of time, it will let go and you will have sensors on the floor. They provide screws for every sensor and it is worth taking the extra time.- There is no camera feed at this time-Siren is not loud enough for my liking. I think that both the base siren and the extra siren need to be louder.  I installed the extra siren in the attic, facing outward, right behind the attic vent so that it would not be exposed to the elements, but still blast basically straight out, and it is not loud enough. If it is a cold, windy night and all neighbors have windows closed they will not hear it.

I previously owned two homes where I had traditional \"hardwire\" burglar alarm systems that involved door sensors, carpet sensor pads and motion detectors. These systems,  25 to 30 years ago cost me over $1,200 each and were local alarm (outside bell) systems that were not monitored by a call center.Retired cop friends of mine have installed the SimpliSafe system so I had an opportunity to physically examine operating systems and do the touch and feel test. One of my retired friends travels alot and uses the SimpliSafe monitoring center and a SmartPhone application to receive notifications when his neighbors enter his house to water his plants. He loves it.We chose to not have our system monitored and rely on neighbors to hear the siren. The system we selected involved two motion detectors, six door sensors and a panic alarm along with smoke detector. Burglars may break a double pane window but in my experience they don't exit through the point of entry in a window, but go out a door. So, we wanted to detect motion, movement, exiting and with the close proximity of neighbors knew that the siren would generate a call to the police, scare off a theif and protect our belongings.We received a discount on our system due to our friends recommendations and they recieved a free months monitoring from SimplySafe, so look for discounts from friends you know and ask the Simplisafe representative for them.We installed the system in less than two hours, and it has worked perfectly, no different from the old systems I had previously installed on my old homes and the components offer five year litihium battery life, and an easy system check. A plus for the wife is that she can use the key chain remote and not utilize the entry key pad. Our neighbor is eager to check our home now since we supplied her with a key chain remote as well.$400 bucks as compared to $1,200 in 1980 dollars or a contract alarm company that requires an initial installation fee and multi-year contract. Who would you select? You do the math! When you give consideration to just the equipment that comprises an alarm system, could it be said that the stuff the commercial companies want to sell you in a three year contract as advertised on TV is better than the stuff that SimpliSafe sells? I think it's pretty much the same stuff. So, if it makes you comfortable paying more because you think you are getting something more then don't do Simplisafe.Next big advantage to SimpliSafe: You own it! It's portable, you can move it from house to house, apartment to apartment by yourself and you don't need a service call or to pay extra to a technician to move it. How cool is that? If you have a college aged daughter who has moved out to her first apartment, buy her a system and get some peace of mind!Also interesting, was the quality feedback and follow-up response by the folks at SimpliSafe. They have customer service down, are based in New Jersey, not some call center in a foreign country. You will enjoy working with these folks.Don't be initimidated by something you don't know. The instructions that come with the delivered system are more complete and informative that what is offered on the SimplSafe website as they should be and you will easily be able to install this system.This is a great value for the price, will give you peace of mind and you will love the interior panic button features that you can purchase to place adjacent to your front door, night stand and in the bathroom of elderly folks who live with you. You will also love the feature that enables you to alarm interior portions of your home to detect intrusion while you are sleeping.Remember to check with your local law enforcement agency regarding alarm ordinances, permits, restrictions and all that when selecting any alarm.And, let's be honest here regarding police capability. I don't know of any police agency that can provide instantaneous police responses to even the most critical emergency.  Having been the Commander of a 9-1-1 Dispatch Call Center I have seen all the issues with answering 9-1-1 calls, getting information, formulating and typing a call up, sending it to a dispatcher, getting the call sent, locating the nearest police car to the call and all the variables associated with traffic jams, weather, confusion in the call and all that. We need to do everything we possible can to enhance our safety and \"tip the scales\" in our favor.

I added 2 additional motion detectors and the 115db siren to the system and it's great. You have to order additional sensors directly from simplisafe though. I don't know why but Amazon doesn't sell them, and the few motion detectors I found on amazon for it were marked up 100% over retail. Don't pay $80 for a motion detector, buy it direct from the mfg for $30 each.A few things to know:The first 72 hours after activating you will be in \"test mode\". They will NOT respond to alarms during this time. IT gives you time to get used to disarming the system.You MAY need an alarm permit from your city. Mine was $50 a yearYou SHOULD tell your insurance company you have a monitored alarm. This saved me $80 a year on homeowners insurance.The monitoring plans are $15 for monitoring only, $20 for texts when system is armed, goes off, etc, and $25 if you want to be able to arm it and change settings from the website.The only sensor I used the sticky pads with was on a window and it worked well. I screwed all other sensors and devices to the wall or door.The motion detector went off from my 12lb cat in a hallway. I ended up mounting it upside down to prevent false alarms. The other 2 motion detectors were far enough away and high enough up that the cat doesn't set them off.The Keyfob is a liability. If a burglar knows where to find it, they can cancel the alarm. Hide it and don't tell anyone where it is.The keyfob has a panic button. Don't keep it on your keys, you might accidentally hit the button starting your car, then look out.....police time.The keyfob is a USB stick. You can configure your system using the included application on the thumb drive. Then you plug the thumb drive into the base station and it programs itself from there. Pretty cool setup.Something else to keep in mind is if a burglar can find your base station within 30 seconds (by default) and destroy it, your alarm won't go off. It's a good idea to hide the base station somewhere and don't tell people where it is. I put mine inside of a cabinet not near any doors.I set the alarm off once to test it. The monitoring center called within 60 seconds and when I didn't answer they had already called the police.

However, the instructions, user manual, and the online support services leave a lot to be desired.  In the initial \"practice\" period, I ran into a lot of \"quirky\" problems which almost caused me to pack it up and send it back.  The online and phone support exchanges were well supported and once I knew why something happened, I felt more comfortable.Let me give you one example.  The installation instructions sated, \"Do not place the base unit on the floor.\"  I figured the reason was to prevent kids and animals from damaging it while running around.  As I have neither, I placed the unit on a raised platform near my fireplace.  On the third day, the base station lost the cellular connection to the company.  This happened on the weekend when no tech support was available.  The online support community (which has no search function) eventually let me know, what should have been included in the instructions.  The unit needed to be 3-5 feet off the ground for better cell receptions, near a window, and the base station has a land line back-up capability.  Had the install instruction had such suggestions, the problem would have been avoided.On the whole, now that I have sorted through a lot of the small issues not adequately laid out in the user manual or install instructions, I am very happy with it.  I had ADT and they kept raising the monthly monitoring fees.  They were not interested in upgrading the system or keeping the price flat.  At $45 a month, I was getting the same service I would from SimpliSafe at $15.  That made for a pretty fast payback on the up front equipment costs. On the other hand, I was able to add smoke detection and carbon monoxide, remote arming/disarming ability, and more entry sensors than my ADT system and only pay $25 a month for a greatly enhanced system over ADT.When I tried to negotiate with ADT for the upgraded services (after being a customer for five years) they would have charged me almost as much as the equipment from SimpliSafe cost, plus another $8 a month for the monitoring...and I still would not have been able to remotely arm/disarm or verify the system status.  When I told them this would cause me to leave to another company, they simply said, Okay, have a nice day.\"Here's the best advice I can give you for getting comfortable with the system.  Take full advantage of the 3 days of practice time.  Trigger everything.  Run through all of the arming/disarming options.  Put the system to the test.  Go to the online support forum and read through as much as you can stand, because it is there you will really learn how the system works.

The equipment has a 3 year warranty and the components are value priced. The batteries are supposed to last 3 to 5 years and probably will, based on previous experience with systems but haven't had it long enough to contradict that. Installation is pretty much foolproof and is voice assisted to aid you. The system and monitoring service is easy to set up and is also guided as you go through the process. Not sure how it could be any better for the money. The only shortage I detected which is probably available in a higher model is the ability to discriminate which sensors are which. The system will not report that a particular sensor is open, only that that type of sensor is reporting, which could be a problem if you have a large system with lots of similar components. (i.e. the system will report an open entry sensor, but does not identify which sensor.) Zone identification is something found in higher end models. One extra benefit I didn't anticipate is that even with the smallest monitoring package, if you log on to your account it will list the time of events, such as alarm disabled at 2:15 P.M. or power outage at 3:10.

Ease of use and programming via the wizard and keychain remote is wonderful!  The growth aspect of this system is a big plus.I elected to install the entry sensors on all doors with provided screws.  I like the tape provided, but I don't trust it from the false alarm perspective.  My alarm is installed in a mountain cabin that experiences BIG temperature changes.The motion sensors require a bit more thought regarding sensitivity and placement.  My cabin has a stem wall underneath and the heating vents are installed in the floor (not the ceiling like many houses or apartments).  If you orient the sensors in the normal upright mode, they look down at a 45 degree angle.  Using the integral test mode, I discovered that they may activate erroneously when the heat comes on in a cold house.  Based on the feedback data provided on the website, I reinstalled the sensors 4' from the floor (to intercept intruders at the waist or chest) and flipped them upside down (so the beam pointed level to 45 degrees up).  That helped appreciably.  I also played with the sensitivity switch located in the battery compartment and set all my sensors to L (low).  They are shipped with the switch set in the midrange position between high and low.  I noticed no real degradation between medium and low except an increased \"persistence\" in sensitivity, detection range did not seem adversely effected in my house.Regarding monitoring, I had to disable mine as there is no T-Mobile support outside of big metropolitan areas in my state (AZ).  Simply put, I would jump on the monitor option even if it were $20 a month if you could negotiate a deal with carriers like Verizon that actually provide excellent cell phone coverage in rural areas.  Further, when I disable monitoring, I wouldn't have expected to get a \"can't connect with dispatcher\" prompt on my keyboard unit.  That alerts any visitors that view your keypad that your alarm is not fully functional.Finally, when I use my keychain remote to arm or disarm the system from outside my home, I have no feedback as to whether the command \"took\".  This drawback is the single reason I gave 4 stars.  This really needs to be fixed.  As an engineer, I would not necessarily change the keychain remote.  Rather, I would add an additional add-on product (like a freeze sensor or a water sensor) that annunciates the state of the alarm system from the base station given the inherent growth of the base module from an I/O perspective.  A simple visual sensor that reflects a command change for two seconds would suffice (and not reflect the current state of the alarm system on a continual basis).  If this sensor could be placed in a window or near a door panel, it would greatly improve the utility of the system and confidence of the user.  Given that such a device is reasonable in price, I would purchase this in a minute.All in all, this system is a great value for the money.  Kudos to the development team.

No wires, just think about where you want the sensor, clean the spot on the trim with alcohol, then peel and stick.All the sensors I purchased with the base station came pre-installed in the system, what a nice touch.  Initially I had a problem where one of the sensors wasn't responding. The system would give a verbal warning that one of the sensor was not responding.  I called Simplisafe and the very polite customer service person advised me to move the base station from behind the TV because of possible interference.  I did, but again the there was a sensor which was not responding.  So I looked up the sensor then traveled around the house looking for it.  It was not to be found.  Then I solved the mystery, I had failed to install one of the sensors (it was still in the box) so it never became active and wasn't detected by the base station.  It was my mistake.The system works flawlessly.  I moved the base station to the third floor and it has no problems detecting the basement sensors.This system even allows the user to put a sensor on a closet, refrigerator, or liquor cabinet so that even when the alarm is off, if anyone opens the door with the sensor, it immediately sends a text to phone number(s) of your choice.  I have a locked closet at with a gun locker in it.  If that door is opened for any reason, the alarm system contacts me via text.  Also when the system is armed or disarmed, I receive a text which tells me who disarmed the system.  The pass code it tied to a name.You can add sensors at any time.  My system has a panic button, door sensors, motion sensor, glass break sensors, smoke and carbon monoxide sensors.  There are approximately 30 sensors in my home and it all works flawlessly.It's a very well designed system and it works very well.  Don't hesitate to give it a try, I wish I hadn't been so fearful of a wireless system and tried it sooner.", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great system, easy to install, great support", "Author": "L.

I think that is one of the most important things to do. I would recommend also as your package arrives to take the extra siren batteries off (if you ordered it) as it may go off if it is not installed and synced with the station. Put batteries in just when ready to install. Spend the time to study where to set the motion sensors and the other type of sensors as this is key. The most sensitive will be the motions sensors that should be at 4-6ft height to detect humans properly and not pointed to heat sources or windows, ideally in a corner and oriented in the direction opposed to the windows. This is key to not have false alarms in the future.I can say that the client support is exceptional, I used the support email. All tips and questions were responded timely. My system is the full most complete one (all sensor types), with smoke detector and carbon monoxide detector, flood detector, etc. It integrates seamlessly and the phone application is very responsive and useful. I bought the interactive monitoring and you can turn on/off the alarm remotely, set it up in Home or Away mode also. You can also monitor the status of the sensors and receive SMSs and email messages.This works great. With this package you can also change the setting on your system online from your Simplisafe account. No more carrying the USB remote stick from the alarm to the computer and back. I found that being very useful.I think it is one of the best systems out there and the good is that it is an alternative to the big guys which have so hidden fees and a pushy sales practice and many still require wires.

I recommend the interactive monitoring $24.99...by the way is still cheaper than any other monitoring service because it allows me to setup each sensor by name.  If the alarms goes off or there is a error I'll get a text letting me know exactly which sensor it is (i.e. backdoor sensor instead of receiving just a serial number of the sensor.  Who's going to remember their sensors by serial number...not this guy.Since the burglar or fire service has not been needed I can't tell you how quick the response is from the fire department or police but the monitoring service notification during a test is pretty quick.  I'm hoping i never get to use it.  Like I said before the peace of mind is all I need.The only complaint I have is the volume of the alarm.  The siren is not as loud the reviews claim.  You can definitely hear it but it's not ear piercing.  That should be a quick fix by ordering another siren....that's only if you want it to extremely loud.  I have three levels in my house.I love that you can customize it.  If you order it and find out you need more sensors, sirens, or anything else it's easy to set up.So far so good and I'm impressed with the product.  It saves me a lot of money.

Simplisafe does not provide a camera yet but I'm fine with that because I can set that up on my own at home with my server.Also, Simplisafe home security is provided to you without a contract.  If you don't want the monitoring service you don't have to get it.  You'll just have an alarm that the neighbors will hear and contact the police for you if you're away.  The sound of the alarm with deter a burglar and they won't know if the police is coming or not.  I was in a 36 month $64 a month contract with Vivint but the system was \"so called\" free.  Not likely, that's over $2300 over the span of three years just for monitoring service and home automation.  I don't think so....I'm willing to bet the system price was included.

I had initially analyzed AT&T; , but went for FrontPoint considering it being rated number one among all the home security systems as per some of sites. Though the customer service of FrontPoint was very good, there were couple of drawbacks in the design of the equipment. Hence I thought of trying out SimpliSafe.And Frankly speaking, I love the design of SimpliSafe!. The fact that the keypad is separate from the base station and Siren, means you need not worry about mistyping the passcode and the siren ringing with more than 100 DB while you are near the keypad.(This happened to me with the FrontPoint!, got me almost deaf).And you can have multiple keypad for multiple doors of entry. Secondly, I could invest more of my money into the equipment than the service. FrontPoint was costing me $43 for interactive service. Also with the SS I did not have to haggle unnecessarily with the sales guy as I had to do with FP.I really loved the feature of SS to have a USB driven settings that I can use to customize the system for home and away options and add & remove any components. With FP, I was forced to go with the interactive package to achieve this. Also the SS components are very easy to remove from the walls/wood. On the other hand FP components when removed, left remains of the adhesive on the walls, almost ruining the looks.Atleast it's good to know that SS can have a back up option of broadband. Apart from AT&T; & SS, no other well known system have this dual capability. Coming to the financials:Any of the systems would at least cost you $1500 or more over period of 3 years even with lot of haggling. With SS, I bought equipment's in actually a bit of excess and purchased worth of $500. This has allowed me to \"super\" protect my home with actually 4 motion sensors and 8 contact sensors with other extras. And I can go for the interactive/monitoring service only when needed. I have control of what I need for my home rather some sales/customer service guy pushing only a limited set of equipment on my throat.Areas for improvement of SimpliSafe: Need the Glass Break Sensor (I think they will have it by March 2014).

I bought the system as a gift to my daughter to help give her peace of mind and a sense of security. The home she lives in with her mother is on the very last lot on her street with two sides exposed to farm fields. The town is small, has no local police service other than the Sheriff's patrol who seldom, if ever, drives by her house. There is a volunteer fire and ambulance service, that is quite good.  As two women, living by themselves, in there location, they easily could become a target of opportunity to anyone seeking to burglarize their home or even target for a home invasion. I am a retired police officer and former sheriff's officer and her mother is a retired police dispatcher. We are very aware of the potential dangers that are present today and especially the vulnerabilities they have. I assisted in the placement of the sensors and other items of the package, with my daughter actually doing the installations, including setting up the alert response programing via WiFi. Her mother opted for the top grade alert notification plan and it was activated within an hour of opening the carton it arrived in. My daughter was very pleased with the appearance of the equipment, its ease of installation and the ease of activation. She repeated her thank you's so many times about how much relief she felt with the system in place, before i left their house,  I had to chuckle. This was one gift I have made that I absolutely knew was genuinely appreciated. It also gave me the gift that I have done something that may well prevent harm from touching someone I love. Peace of mind comes to the giver as-well-as the receiver. The reduction of the homeowner's insurance premium to my ex-wife appears to be a large enough to cover several months of the alert monitoring cost.

From reading their site, I was under the impression that the siren was in the keypad because some intruders will try to smash the keypad on traditional systems before it can call the police. The idea being that with simplisafe, the keypad goes off, they smash it, and the base station silently calls the police in the background anyways. It does, but not silently. Additionally, the keypad is usually by the door, so that is where you would want a siren.- The siren in the base station isn't loud enough. You can definitely hear it throughout my whole apartment, but I would doubt if my neighbors or anyone outside can hear it. If you have a house, your neighbors will never hear it. For that reason, a 105dB siren seems necessary. I'll be buying one shortly and putting it near the door.- The only way to set the system to 'home' when you're leaving is to open the door, set it to home, and then leave. Not a big deal, but it makes it more difficult when you're leaving but someone else is still home. The 'away' mode does give you sufficient time to leave. I usually just use the app in this case.- The android app is a little buggy yet. It works fine, just not perfectly.- The base station has a redundant connection in case cell service is out, but it's an RJ-11 phone line, not an RJ-45 network cable. I read another review on here where someone was excited because they could plug it into their router for a backup connection. When I unboxed it, I saw the backup connection is phone line only. This was probably the most disappointing con for me, as I only know three people with a landline, and only one person without an internet connection. Internet is ubiquitous, phone service is not. Please fix this simplisafe!!OVERALL-------------------------------------I highly recommend this system. It's affordable, modern, easy to use, easy to setup, modular, and portable.

YOU determine how many sensors you need for your home (not a commissioned salesperson,) YOU determine what sort of monitoring you want (or no monitoring at all if you wish,) and YOU can install it-easily!  Oh, and if you move, YOU can take it with you to your new home.  EASILY!!!Best of all, the price is fair, and it works great!My home is a 1,800 sq. ft. split-level.  I ended up choosing the deluxe system (which comes with a 105dB alarm, flood sensor, freeze sensor and panic alarm), added an additional entry sensor, an additional remote, and three smoke alarms. With the additional equipment, my security system is now also a FIRE alarm, FLOOD alarm, and a FREEZE alarm.  I used to worry about having a sump-pump failure when I wasn't home.  Not anymore.Installation couldn't be easier.  The sensors come shipped with quality 3M adhesive strips that securely attach each piece of equipment to your home.  They are easily removed if needed.  Simplisafe ships extras with your system in case you decide later to move something.  You also have the option of attaching equipment with small screws if you prefer.  All equipment comes with screws should you prefer that route.The base station is the brains of the operation.  It communicates with your keypad and sensors wirelessly.  It communicates with Simplisafe's monitoring via cellular connection.THIS was the only hiccup of my installation.Simplisafe systems are shipped with T-Mobile cellular modules installed in their base stations.  Apparently, where I live, T-Mobile's signal wasn't strong enough to send & receive data.  A few calls to Simplisafe's tech support (which was very good, wait time less than 5 minutes each call, U.S.-based call personnel) ruled out any equipment problems.  The tech sent out a Verizon module.  Within a few days, it arrived at my door (no charge.)  A few minutes later, my system was online and working perfectly!I opted for the 24/7 interactive monitoring.  This gives you the ability to fine-tune your system via Simplisafe's website--entry delays, keypad/voice volume levels, even specific entry sensors can set to custom specifications.  Some entry sensors you may want to trigger an alarm instantly.  You can do that.  Some entry sensors you may not want an alarm at all.  You can do that.  You can even set an entry sensor to alert you secretly via text or e-mail that it has been tripped.  (Liquor cabinet, anyone?)24/7 also gives you the ability to control your system via smart phone.  The freeze sensor will tell you what the current temperature in your home is through your phone.  You can be sent alerts of the system being armed/disarmed.All in all, I'm very happy with this system.

The trouble I was running into was that most if not all security systems that are sophisticated enough to offer a single point of control (keypad) for many different types of sensors (entry, motion, glass break, etc.) are made purposefully difficult to program as to scare off DIYers like myself from attempting the job and keep the licensed installers in business.  Then I heard about SimpliSafe on the Glenn Beck Radio program and then later the same day on The Dave Ramsey Radio program and looked it up.  SimpliSafe offers a wide assortment of wireless sensors, a single point of control and no contract is required.  They pre-program the system for you prior to shipment so all you have to do is activate the batteries on each sensor and place.  They even include 3M Command strips so you can easily remove/relocate sensors without damaging your walls.There are three monitoring plans with no contract required, starting at $15/month for basic monitoring up to $25/month for full remote control via mobile devices (costs as of the time of this writing.)  I really like that there is no contract.  I can downgrade/cancel my monitoring at any time and the system will still work stand alone (like a car alarm for your house.)  I doubt I ever will because the rates are very affordable and I like knowing the police (fire department in the case of the smoke alarm) will show up if needed, but I find comfort in knowing I have the option and am not stuck.  With some other alarm companies, they retain ownership of the equipment so if you stop monitoring services they will come by to collect their equipment even after the term of the contract is up.I was always weary of \"free equipment, free install, one day and one day only\" so called deals for greasy door to door salesman, because I know there is no such thing as free lunch.  They make their money back on monthly fees over the 2 year contracts that they lock you into.  I also don't like having to schedule a time to be home to meet the installer, let alone having a stranger in my house at all.

So although Simplisafe's monitoring is slightly cheaper (if using the top tier plan that offers app access) than some other companies, you really aren't saving much long term because the bulk of the cost is up front.

I called and talked with the folks at simplisafe before my purchase and purchased the system on the guarantee of 60 days full money back return.  My experiences were less than satisfactory however, and quite disappointing.My problems began just 12 hours after installing the system.  I had purchased the interactive level of monitoring because it was important to me to be able to turn the system on and off from my cell phone if I had forgotten to do so before leaving home.  Twelve hours after installing, just the next morning, I started playing with the app and interactive services and the first time I used the app, I was told I had no connections to the server.  I kept playing with it, trying to get connectivity and in short, I was able to use these services only several times in a month trial.  Most times I could just not depend on it working period.  Now, do not get me wrong, it appeared that monitoring was working.....most times, however, in that month trial I did lose my link to dispatcher several times, so even that was troubling.I finally used the \"placement feature\" provided with the system to make sure the base station was sitting in the best spot and to my surprise, no where in my house was a \"best spot\".  The signal was intermittent at best and kept dropping out altogether.  Eventually I found a spot that seemed the strongest signal placement but in 36 hours my entire system was DEAD.  No link to dispatcher, no interactive services no nothing.  I called Simplesafe again and was told to take the base station outside.  Once there, I was told my system came online immediately, so inside my home was not getting a signal and outside was. A more troubling look into the company was the tech I spoke to.  He actually told me he did not know what else to do other other than somehow mounting the base station on the roof and affixing an umbrella over it. They ONLY USE T-Moble so I had no choice but to return the system for a refund, which they did with no pressure to keep it. They do stand by their money back guarantee.Buyer beware, Simplisafe ONLY uses T-Mobile so if you are not sure about the signal strength of that carrier where you are, you may have problems.

Except for ONE CRITICAL FLAW which MUST be fixed", "Author": "Roman M", "ReviewID": "R1WV8GJGU21P85", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have had a passion for alarm systems for well over 20 years. This is the 5th home alarm system that I have used so far. I had the first four systems for at least 3-7 years each so I am familiar with what's out there. I discovered SimpliSafe last year. It actually came with my new condo and I was blown away by its simplicity and I love the fact that it is all wireless. My condo came with SimpliSafe 1 and this week I upgraded to SimpliSafe 2. The main reason for my upgrade was because SimpliSafe 2 allows you to set your sensors to INSTANT ON. This is a critical function in any alarm system. The way I have it set up is:1. There is a door sensor at the front entrance. If someone opens the door, they have 20 seconds to type in the PIN before the full blown alarm goes off and the alarm company gets notified.2. If an intruder breaks in through the front door (which is the only way my condo can be accessed, as it is pretty high up) and starts walking through the living room towards the base, the motion sensor will detect him/her. Since my motion sensor is set to INSTANT ON, the full blow alarm SHOULD go off at this point. However, it doesn't because, in the words of a SimpliSafe's rep, \"the system respects the entry delay period\". That makes absolutely no sense and is a CRITICAL FLAW in the system. No other alarm system that I've ever used had this problem.When I spoke with a customer service rep about this today, he right away agreed with me that this is a flaw and couldn't think of a single reason why it would have been programmed this way. He told me that he would send a message to their engineers to see if they can fix this.I also contacted SimpliSafe via email and one of their customer service reps, Greeny, wrote back: \"I am sorry if this does not fit your desires exactly, but this is how the system is programmed.\"When you set a motion detector to \"Instant On\" it should go off instantly, per its description, otherwise you are leaving the base vulnerable. If someone breaks into your place, you want to give the system every chance of contacting the monitoring company. Any additional delays is time that the intruder can use to destroy the base. If you have a \"SimpliSafe\" sticker or sign posted in front of your house, any thief who is familiar with this system will look for the base in order to destroy it. (There are multiple videos on YouTube that clearly indicate that the base is the brains of the system)In addition, the base itself is hard to hide as: 1) it is fairly large, 2) it needs to be close enough to the keypad, otherwise you'll get an \"Base out of reach\" error message, 3) SimpliSafe recommends to put it by a window in order to get a clear signal. What that means is that the base is fairly difficult to hide and, therefore, vulnerable.Every alarm system in the world has one, or more, weaknesses. In the case of SimpliSafe, its weakness is the base. The base must be protected in order for this to work. Having a motion sensor pointed in the room where the base is located is the way to go, but it only works if INSTANT ON actually works the way it was designed.We need to pressure SimpliSafe to fix this via a firmware update. Once they do, I will update my review to 5 stars.Finally, it would be nice if customer service was available a little more than simply during EST business hours. Hopefully, as the company continues to grow they will hire more staff and increase their hours.

However to get the full potential and options of the alarm you must pay the $24.99 per month fee. I paid almost $500 for a system that I own but I don't have access to all the features unless I pay them more money per month. For instance zone naming is not available unless you pay the extra fee. Really? What good is an alarm if you can't name the zones? How do you know which sensor is closed/open/tripped/malfunctioning? Even with the zone naming the keypad doesn't tell you which zone is open/tripped, you have to log into the main webpage to check which sensor is tripped. I have a real problem with paying full price for a system yet having features of my equipment not accessible to me (the owner) without paying extra fees.

Although I have Verizon mobile service, there are areas in my house where reception is very poor. One of the reasons that I chose SimpliSafe is because of the 60 day trial period. If the GSM connection didn't perform, I intended to return the system. I've had the system just under a month with no GSM issues.As almost everyone has stated, the setup / installation was quite easy and straightforward. As I wasn't sure about the GSM connection, I elected to install all the sensors with the adhesive tape on the back of the devices rather than the screws.My first complaint is trivial but one of those annoying items that could easily be remedied. The suggested and logical location for the motion sensors is in the corner. In fact the motion sensor housing is molded so that it can attach to the two walls. It can also be attached to a single wall using the flat surface on the back. The adhesive tape on the back of the motion sensor is positioned on this flat surface in the center, There is no adhesive tape on the molded areas that attach to the two walls when positioned in the corner. So the first thing I found myself doing was using the extra adhesive tape on the first couple of motion sensors and then  running down to the hardware store to purchase some double-sided adhesive to complete the installation of the remaining motion sensors.I was a bit worried about using just the adhesive to attach the sensors but didn't want screw holes in the walls and trim in case I ended up returning the system. Sure enough, one of the sensors fell off the wall and triggered an alarm while I was away. The dispatch service was unable to contact me so police where dispatched on a false alarm. The alarm that fell was the transmitter module of an entry alarm. The alarm was positioned about 6 feet above ground in a shed across the driveway. The good news is that the module still works. I re-attached it with the screws. When I tried to remove the corresponding magnetic module of the entry alarm I could not peel it from the door trim. I ended up removing the cover and screwing it in through the adhesive. Maybe it was a bad bit of adhesive or maybe it was because the shed is quite a bit colder and the adhesive didn't take as well. All the other components are firmly attached with adhesive only, but I will be adding screws as I've decided to keep the system.The component in the shed is the furthest from the base control and I am impressed that it is within range.I added the key chain remote to my key ring which I keep in my front pocket. While I was carrying some boxes into the garage, I must have pressed against a box, with the remote, because the alarm was enabled. The siren went off and I disabled the alarm at the keypad. This happened during the '3 day'learning period' so there was no dispatch. As a result, I've disabled the Panic Button on the remote. Also, I learned that the alarm siren is not very loud. It might be okay in an apartment building, but I live in a single family house and I doubt any of my neighbors would take notice. I will be adding the external siren component in the near future.I gave the system 4 stars rather than 5 because I don't like the fact that an alert is transmitted after the entry delay expires. Given that there are decals on the windows and a sign on the front lawn, it doesn't take much on-line research to determine what the base unit looks like and the shortcomings. If the software triggered an alert immediately and then cancelled the alert if the system was disarmed during the entry delay, I would have given the product 5 stars. The entry delay is however configurable and can be set at zero seconds which results in an immediate alert. I've set the entry delay on my system to 15 seconds which gives me time to fumble once and still disarm the alarm.Thus far the cat has not caused any of the 5 motion sensors in my configuration to trigger.Unless you have a real good memory or subscribe to the enhanced monitoring, I suggest you carry a small cheat sheet in your wallet with the component serial numbers. If a component does raise an alert, the only way to determine which component raised the alert is from the serial number. If you subscribe to the enhanced monitoring, the software allows you to 'name' each component.I would recommend this product to a friend or family.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.

As soon as you pull the battery tab on, say, an entry sensor, it connects to the base station and registers. Looking at the keypad, I noticed it was telling me that it couldn't connect to certain sensors. At first I thought they might be out of range, but then I realized I just hadn't unpacked them from the box yet! I had no issues getting the sensors to work regardless of where I put them (even in the garage or the most distant corner of the house).One issue I did have is with cell reception, but that's not SimpliSafe's fault. I don't get T-Mobile reception at my house, and in the past I had to have a booster before I finally switched to Verizon. In my part of the country, SimpliSafe uses T-Mobile by default. It *might* be good if they asked when you order what cell carrier you'd prefer, since people tend to know what carrier has the best reception for them. Perhaps there's a reason why they don't, but in any case I called customer support and they shipped out a new cell card free of charge, and I swapped out the card in the base station.One very minor nit is that the system comes with additional 3M Command adhesive strips (located on the back of the lid that contains the remote), but if you buy a bunch of extra sensors like I did, you don't get enough extra strips per sensor for corner mounting. The motion sensors have a 90-degree field of view, so typically you'd want to put them in a corner of the room. However the sensors come with a single adhesive strip directly in back of them. There are placeholders for additional strips to allow attaching to the corner of a room, but you need to put those strips in. Long story short, I ordered some more strips:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014CQGW4/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc;=1Other than that, the system is very state-of-the-art and user friendly. Even with the basic monitoring package, I can go on the web site and see a log of when the system was activated and deactivated, which remote did it, etc. When I ran a test, I got an immediate call from the dispatch service. Customer support is good and responsive.The main issue with any alarm system is false alarms, because in most cities you'll get a certain number of false alarm allowances, and then the city will charge you for more. I haven't had any false alarms yet; so far so good. I made sure to place the motion sensors so that they aren't pointing at exterior windows or hit by sunlight, so barring sensor failure I hope to have no issues in that department. You have 60 days to return the system, so that should be plenty of time to see if false alarms are an issue and attempt to mitigate them.SimpliSafe also notifies you if your city requires an alarm permit. It turns out mine does, much to my annoyance -- but while I'm annoyed with the city (if they already charge in the event of false alarms, why should I pay them extra just to own an alarm?), I appreciate SimpliSafe doing that homework for me.All-in-all, with the price, features, simplicity, good customer support, and 60-day return policy, plus the ability to easily move with the system, this is a no-brainer slam-dunk for an alarm system.", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great system, Great Pricing, Easy setup", "Author": "Joshua Anders", "ReviewID": "R2ZQU5HNDYPKN8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got simplisafe because it came highly recommended by someone I respect incredibly.

Certainly A LOT cheaper than the other companies that come and install and I have heard horror stories of the installers actually being the ones who break in!  So with SIMPLIsafe you have control over your own house which I like.Also like that you can try things and move them around your self like motion sensors, I am still working on the best places for that.  You can also order additional parts pretty inexpensively.  It will be interesting to see how long the batteries work on the individual sensors but the keypad will let you know that.  You can also order fire detectors and connect them, which I think I will do because then the keypad would let me know when I need to replace the batteries.

I very rarely write reviews.  I just moved from a home in the suburbs to a condo in a metropolitan area.  In our previous home, we had a monitored security system that was installed professionally, cell hookup, all that.  It was a nice system, but sure- I had a hefty monthly fee.When we moved to the condo- we had no system, and I don't know how long we will be here (renting).  After doing much research (google) I decided to go with this system to secure my home.  After ordering, it arrived a few days later- and it seriously took me 20 minutes to install.  As a techy, I actually thought setting it up was fun.  It looks just as durable as my old system.  I ran into ZERO issues with the setup.  I set the base station fairly close to the front door - so we could easily hear the chimes and announcement when the door opens.  I love the online interface, and also the app for iphone.  Seriously think that this thing is better and more intuitive than my previous system.  It's great.  I DID buy the extra alarm/speaker because I read some reviews saying that the base station wasn't loud enough.  (I haven't tested how loud it is yet-  but I can see how it would be needed..)  I highly recommend this product.

All of the components are well made and initial set up was easy.  It took about 30 minutes to install the master unit,  two wall keyboard units, 4 door alarms, and a motion sensor (also a key fob controller. Setup is done on a computer by inserting the key fob into the usb port (yes the key fob is also a flash drive with all of the necessary software installed---but no software is installed on your computer).  You set up your PIN number and decide on the type of monitoring (not necessary but a wise thing to do). You can also configure each of the components through this program.  After configuring, just plug the key fob into the top of the master unit and all of the configuration parameters are transferred to the unit.  Turning on the alarm is as simple as pushing a button on the keyboard unit or on the key fob.  There is both a home and away mode.There is also a website where you can change, add, and configure pretty much any part of the system.I also downloaded the Android App, which allows me to control certain aspects of the system (like turning it on and off and looking at an event log).  My only complaint is with the motion detector alerts.  A safe alert (just to you and not to the monitoring service) is recorded every time the motion sensor is triggered whether the alarm is on or off.  There should be an option to only receive safe alerts when the alarm in on.  This is a minor point and in no way distracts from the usefulness of this system.

The Web Interface and Android Apps are simple to use and cover all of the basics, but are a little rough around the edges.  I wish the temperature was automatically updated in the App and the base station didn't announce sync events when using the App to check the house, but minor issue.The only other thing I wish is that they were a little more straightforward on the pricing for monitoring.  They constantly talk to the Base Pricing and you have to dig a little to realize that the interactive pieces are $10 more a month which is still cheaper than the competition, but would have preferred them to be a little more transparent.They are missing a video solution at this time and when that is available, I think they will have the best solution period.", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great System", "Author": "G.

I am planning on moving soon, and I love that I will be able to move my system to my new home and expand the system as needed to protect my new home.

Installation was really simple but did take longer than 30 mins as one motion sensor was not working but customer service sent out a new one immediately but later I discovered when on the phone with a technician that they had put the wrong sensor code in place so I just went online and corrected this error so check the codes on each piece to make sure it matches with what's showing online.  I love this system so far and especially the 72 hour testing period so you can play around with it until you feel comfortable learning how to use it.  I did decide to go with the 24/7 security monitoring as my husband had passed away a few months ago and although my older Son lives with me at the moment I felt safer doing this and loved that there is no long contracts to sign but my city did require a permit which was easy to obtain and then you give the security company your permit number.  One thing I would love them to add to this is an outdoor camera which they don't offer so I purchased a higher end dummy camera and installed this outside the front area until I find one that is easy to install.  We have been using this for 4 days now and I love it plus once you register online you can have texts sent to your smartphone or iPad letting you know when the alarm has been turned on or off which lets me see if my Son forgot to turn it on when I'm away.  Love the panic buttons on the keypad and keychain but especially the wall mounted panic button for my bedside.

I have tested it and it is definitely plenty loud just with the sound emanating from its central base station unit. Unless you are known to have Fort Knox like treasure or the Hope diamond in your house, any burglar is likely to leave very quickly and go and try their trade in a quieter location. I have two extra sirens on order to regale the neighbors in case a potential intruder is crazy enough to endure that sound.  The neighbors will hopefully call the police if for nothing more than two shut up that noisy alarm.The original system I purchased came with an extra door sensor which I have not activated, but somehow the central control unit thought it should be there. Therefore it flashed an error on the keypad module. It took me a while to figure out why that was the case. The key-fob USB plugged into my Mac running OS 10.9.2 did NOT work at all,(that is why only four stars) but it did work just fine when that same Mac was booted on a HD with OS 10.6.8. It also worked on a Windows XP virtual machine running under OS 10.9.2 on that same Mac which is how I eventually ended up programming the system to eliminate the error and change some other settings. After any change in programming is made using the USB key-fob, it is VERY important to synchronize those changes with the central unit by plugging the USB key-fob into the main unit.

So if he set it off I would just get a text message. Eventually I had to turn the motion detector upside down for him not to trigger the sensor.Few things missing:1. Camera (assuming that is in the pipeline)...this is a must2. On the Key Ring...You can disable the \"Panic\" button, or disable all the buttons...however I would like to disable the \"Off\" button. Seems like if someone steals your keys you could be in trouble. You don't need to enter the code when pressing off.3. On the iPhone/iPad app you should be able to control everything like you can on the website...changing alarm settings etc...I have an iPad mounted on my wall to control other things in my house. Also, I would like to use the app as another Key Pad, however, you don't have to enter your pin code EVERY time you enter the app...just the first time. So someone could walk in and go to simplisafe (which is already open in the background) and press \"Off\".I get a little nervous that the sensors might fall because they're only using command strips...but you do have the option of drilling them in...which I haven't gotten around too.All around very good value...just needs some security updates (key ring....steal keys...press off with no code, iPhone/iPad app only input pin code once) and cameras.But you can't beat $25 a month for live monitoring.", "Date": "May 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "A great alarm system and easy to install", "Author": "KenLR", "ReviewID": "R2KPLNEVDTLSHY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Simplisafe alarm system is exactly what we needed.

We eventually decided cellular was what we wanted and then discovered SimpliSafe whose product is based on cellular, offers considered flexibility with sensors, does not need professional installers (it took me the short time they predicted to get it operational), and has a monthly monitoring fee that is lower than anything else I had seen.  The total cost is a fraction of other systems we were considering.

For those wondering the keypad can be left in plane sight, destroying it won't stop the cell signal from being sent.Other than these 2 issues, primarily the potential of grab and smash of main base unit I'm pleased. I believe its worth the cost with the no contract, but take the extra precaution and hide the base unit. This may mean adding the 105 decibel siren is also necessary so you can clearly hear the alarm throughout the home. I've also added extra motion sensors, glass breakage, smoke and the siren.I do like the ability to individually program each sensor with the USB key chain remote. For instance I programmed motion sensors to be on in a couple unused bedrooms while in the home mode. Normally motion sensors are off in home mode. I did this because the entry sensors won't go off if a window gets smashed and our bedroom is some distance away. Glass breakage sensors are an option but what if they don't break the window so opted for the motion detectors. I also armed the doors in those unused bedrooms so I may have overkill but have always felt if there ever is a breakin that's where it will be, because of the bedroom locations on the back side of the home.Cheers....", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "Donald C.", "ReviewID": "R2SLPW3G5NPFTB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I think this is a great product, and it is everything they claimed it was.

Customer support was good at figuring out which sensor was the bad one, and sent me a replacement sensor in a timely manner.  I do wish the key pad buttons were back lit and larger, it would make it much easier to use.  Also, the \"Home\" program needs to be updated so you can set it when you leave while someone is still in the house, for example, I leave for work before my wife does, so I want to set the alarm in the \"Home\" mode so the house is armed correctly while she is still there.  In order to set the alarm this way, I have to open the door, letting in the cold air, before setting the alarm.  You should be able to set the \"Home\" mode like normal while the alarm gives you 30 - 60 seconds to exit the house, the same way it works for setting the alarm in the \"Away\" mode.  I don't understand why it is set up so you have to open the door first.  It doesn't make sense to me, i guess because my old alarm did not require you to open the door first to set the \"Home\" mode when leaving.  I think addressing both of these issues would make the system much easier to use, benefiting the consumer, and therefore benefiting Simplisafe in the long run.

The Smartphone App is great too - if the wife forgets to arm the system I can do it from my phone wherever I am - and we only need the one Key Chain remote, as my phone serves as my remote.  I actually used the SimpliSafe Web site to buy the system because I wanted to'tailor' the components in our system.  The Amazon site is awesome though because without the excellent range of reviews I might not have gotten enough detail to make a good decision.  A little feedback for SimpliSafe - a tiny thing figuratively and literally - the supplied 1/4 inch long entry alarm mounting screws aren't quite long enough to mount on door frames that have the decorative raised molding designs.  No problem - I invested another 96 cents or so at our local hardware to buy eight 1/2 inch screws that have sufficient length to bore into the recesses of the decorative door frame molding.  As I said, that's 'the biggest thing I have to warn any body about'.  Oh - one more thing - if like me you would like the temperature readout on the SmartPhone app to give a reading, spend the bucks for the Freeze Warning sensor.  I thought the Wireless Controller somehow did the sensing for temperature, but it does not - you need the Freeze Sensor.

Smith", "ReviewID": "R3C799JDR2QT75", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With wireless home security systems, I am comfortable installing the newer ones myself. The key differentiator for SimpliSafe is the fact that they actually allow you to use a (responsive) 24/7 security monitoring service that will actually call and dispatch the police if you need help. If my security system goes off, a text message to my personal number isn't going to do me much good.  I want the police to respond, and SimpliSafe is one of the few, self-install systems that allows for this. Add the fact that software setup is clean and quick and cellular connectivity is standard, and this is the best system I could find.We've been Broadview/Brinks/ADT customers for over 10 years... and we've been fortunate that our monitoring rates haven't crept up as high as everyone else. However, we were still paying around $34/month for basic security monitoring on our system. As we've moved to a voice over IP (VOIP) home phone solution, we were seeing larger inconveniences in using ADT through our landline and became increasingly worried over a bad guy cutting our connectivity before breaking into the house.So, we did some digging and found great reviews of people using SimpliSafe.  We held off for a while because they didn't have a glass break sensor and it would cost us up front to switch to them, even if the monthly fees dropped by half. We also had some false assumptions about the system that was already installed in our house. It turns out, not every window was covered in the hard-wired system. Once we found that out and SimpliSafe added the glass break sensor, we jumped at the chance to switch.Setup was quick and easy. When we put the system into test mode, our sensors responded AND we received a test call from the security monitoring service before we could even reach the first sensor to test it.  The only downside we see is that the contact sensors for doors and windows are a little bulkier than some of the competitors.

It worked right out of the box with clear instructions and very intuitive menus.

There became an issue with their contract with a certain cellular service provider. I live out in the country and do not have access to standard internet and have to use satellite. The cell provider they were using for my area was no longer an option since they lost the contract with them. I looked into Simplisafe and it was the same type of system as the one I had been using. The cell service they had available was one that happens to have excellent service in my area. The monitoring cost for the interactive monitoring was about half the cost ($42.98 with the old and $24.99 with Simplisafe). The features on the site are not as detailed as the other provider but acceptable. The system was just as easy to set up and the cost of the equipment was much cheaper. I liked the fact that I bought the equipment rather than using it for free and having to return everything when they cancelled my 3 year contarct (which Simplisafe has no contract). One thing that really bothered me with the old company is that they lost the contract at the end of December 2013. I called when my system wasn't working and they had their engineers look into it. I received an e-mail from them that there was an issue and they were sending me a new cellular gateway. 2 weeks later, I received teh new gateway and installed it. It worked for the first 3 days. I contacted them when it stopped working and, again, they said their engineers would look into it. 3 weeks went by and I heard nothing from them. It is now March and my system hasn't worked for over 2 months. When I called to find out waht was going on, they said they would have to call me back.

Water leaks and resulting flood damage are a huge concern in Florida because we seldom have floor drains here.  We were able to easily add 3 water sensors to the system to catch any leak while it is still barely a trickle.  All of it can be monitored with our computers and most important our cell phones.

The system does not tell you \"front door open\" . In the event or an open door/window you are told an entry sensor is open and then you need to hunt around to find out where exactly the problem is. Not a problem for a small house.My advice - If you want basic security and no monitoring this system is GREAT. You get what you pay for.

I live in a rural area that is growing and recently, some undesirables have moved into the area and I hated to ever leave home.  I have some valuable items in my home and detached garage that I wouldn't want stolen.  I am older now and have tennitis (ringing in my ears) and I sleep with a sound machine.  I have worried that if someone broke into my home in the middle of the night, I might not hear them.  So, I began to research security systems and came across SimpliSafe.  After reading various forums and favorable reviews regarding SimpliSafe, and seeing what I considered to be low cost for the initial set up and for the monitoring service (with no contract), I quickly realized that SimpliSafe was for me.  When I went to their site, I saw that they had refurbished units and I saw some good reviews on these.  I purchased one that had everything that I wanted and when it arrived, I was shocked!  Everything looked brand new and also performed brand new!  I honestly couldn't tell what was refurbished!  I had watched some good Youtubes on how to install the product so I was ready to go at it.  So easy...and I'm not a very handy person!  If I could figure it out and install it, anyone can!  I contacted the support center regarding some questions I had about my detached garage and the lady that I spoke too could not have been nicer and she was very knowledgeable.  I really liked the 72 hour testing period as it gave me time to install, move various sensors around, and play with it before the actual monitoring started.  I did not rely on the sticky tape, but chose to use the screws so the sensors wouldn't fall off.  I placed the motion sensors on shelves instead of sticking them on the wall.  They work great!  I have the additional alarm that I installed on the front porch and it sounds off!  My neighbors have no problem hearing it!  I love the app for my iPhone and I also like the key controls.  I called the Sheriff's Department and was happy to find out that my area doesn't require a permit.  I got notified after my 72 hour test period that I was officially on line and now I have such wonderful peace of mind!  So well worth it.  Now I sleep like a baby knowing that alarms will sound if someone tries to break into my home or garage and when I'm away, someone will be monitoring my house.

My only regret about purchasing this system is that I didn't do it sooner. Two family members also have the system, one for commercial use and the other for residential, and they both love it as well.I purchased the 17-Piece Ultimate Package at $539.85, and later added a second keypad. For years I'd researched various security companies and systems, and I always walked away in disgust at the exorbitant rates, not to mention the blatant scare tactics. I'd received $1200 quotes on other installed security systems, both wireless and wired, but I just didn't feel good about doing business with these companies with their overpriced equipment, high monitoring fees and Gestapo-like contracts.At first, I was a bit intimidated at the prospect of setting up a security system on my own. But I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was. In the end, I liked having the freedom to set it up on my own time and pace, and consider the best placement of the components for my home and situation.This system really has brought me peace of mind, at a reasonable cost for both equipment and monitoring. The basic monitoring is only $15 - compared to the typical $30/$35 of most services. The add-on components are also much less than the typical price. For example, an extra door/window sensor is $15. Several of the other companies I researched charge up to $35. This was significant for me, as I live in a ranch home and so I needed a lot of sensors to cover every entry point.As with any system, there are additional features one would ideally like to have. In this case, it would be helpful if the keypad and keyfob had an indicator to show the status of the system (On-Home, On-Away, or Off). And when I last checked, the company had not yet developed and offered glass break sensors. But I also recognize that these \"nice to have\" features would likely increase the cost of what is an economical system.If you have pets, as I do, it may take a bit of experimenting to find the right placement for the motion sensors. I had to move one of the sensors higher than the recommended 5 feet from the floor. I discovered the Away setting was fine if it was only my cat walking through the house, but my dogs would trigger the motion sensor (likely when my little dog jumped up on a recliner near the sensor).SimpliSafe is a truly refreshing company in this age of greed and fine-print \"gotcha\" tactics. My experience is that what they claim on their site is not merely marketing spiel simply to reel you in - as is too often the case - but rather is a true reflection of their fair price products/services and customer-friendly policies.I've called SimpliSafe for support twice, and both times the service was excellent. The first time was when I attempted to activate the service after the installation and my components were not connecting with their system. A helpful, knowledgeable CSR walked me through a few steps and I was connected within minutes. The second time was after I bought a second keypad for the back door. I wasn't sure I actually needed it after I discovered I could set Home from the keyfob by holding down the Off and Away buttons at the same time. (The keyfob has three buttons: Away, Off, and Panic.) The CSR said it was not a problem to return the keypad at a full refund. In the end, I decided to keep it, but it was nice to know I had the option of a return without a hassle. I can't count the number of people I've told about SimpliSafe.

You have to upgrade to $25.99/month to be able to easily program the system on a computer (easiest way)  and have remote access.  AND, every step on their Website is constantly trying to push you up to the $25.99/month price point.  It is like here is the system, but it will cost you an extra $10/month to take advantage of all the benefits.  SIMPLISAFE, just charge everyone the same for the basic components and have upgrades for remote access.  I switched from a more costly ADT system , but SimpliSafe outperforms ADT.To be fair, I had a problem with my system not being delivered properly, thanks to the United Postal Service mistake, but SimpliSafe's Customers Service was great.  Shipped another system overnight at their expense.  First system showed up a few days later and everyone was happy.

The system is extremely simple to set up and the instructions couldn't be clearer.  The base even gives voice prompts when testing the system or programming the key fob.  The sensors are simple to affix to any wall and door and they are sturdy.  The only issue I has was one exterior was inset too far into the frame for the sensor on the frame to detect the magnet affixed to the actual door.  So I had to superglue an extra cheap miniblind bracket that I had on the door to bring the magnet further out from the door.  Works perfect and looks good.  The fact that the battery in each sensor lasts 3-5 years is also  great.  I recently ordered the fire/smoke sensor because my insurance discount will pay for almost half the alarm system if I include that sensor.My only complaint would be that text/e-mail alerts should be included in the $14.99 plan, instead of charging an extra $5.00 for it.  It would see to be a simple and cheap addittional service to provide at no additional cost to the customer.

I looked at A LOT of name brand alarm systems sold with monitoring service and a service contract.  Between the cost of the installation and the cost and commitment for the monitoring contract, I just couldn't justify the investment.Then I found SimpliSafe.  The cost for the equipment was very reasonable.  They had a wide range of the type of sensors they offered.  The support/customer service before (I had a lot of questions) and after the purchase was 2nd to none.  The cost for the SimpliSafe monitoring service was far less than others that I had found plus there is no contract requirement.  I really like the flexibility of how each sensor can be configured as to how to respond and it made notification to you of a detected problem.The hardest part of installing the SimpliSafe alarm system was deciding where to locate the alarm sensors so they would best monitor the security and activity of my home.I like having the ability to monitor my alarm system using my smart phone or tablet.  I waited a couple of weeks to write this review because I wanted to check the reliability of the system and my installation.  When I tested the system for accuracy, the system responded as it was supposed to and so far I have not gotten any false alarms.  I also like having a system that not only watches my home when I am away but it also monitors the home while I am at home.I definitely recommend the SimpliSafe alarm system.

The system was easy to install and set up.  I do recommend screwing in the keypad controller due to its weight (mine fell of the wall about 1/2 after being put on with the 3m tape).  The extra siren is screwed on as well, and makes a big difference in how loud the alarm is.  I ordered additional entry sensors as well, and everything installed and set up as instructed (easily).So far, the system has been working well. I have the $24.99/month service so I can get text alerts when its armed, disarmed, set off, or any error.  Its nice with kids, to know who has entered (based on their own private code).  In addition, with the full service, you can identify (by nickname) all of your sensors which is a great feature.  This way I know which sensor was set off.  The iphone application works great as well, allowing me to arm and disarm the system from anywhere.The only issues I have had with the system so far were: 1) My extra siren had to be synchronized to the system a couple times as it didn't go off when the alarm was tested/triggered. Its a very easy process to resync it (just press the button in the back and hold it while pressing the \"off\" button on either the keypad or keychain several times).  I had to resync it 2-3 times but now it seems to be working fine (although you never really know until the alarm is triggered). 2) A couple times, my keypad has said \"keypad out of range\", yet my keypad is in the same room as my base station (and our house is very small at 1,300 SF).  Not sure what caused it, but it only happened a few times and then went back in range (might be the placement of the base station). 3) the double A batteries included in the keypad and extra siren needed to be replaced within a couple weeks.  This wasn't really a big deal as it could have been sitting in the warehouse for months.Customer service was very friendly and helpful. For some reason, mine shipped without the yard sign. I called and they apologized and sent one out immediately.  They offered to send it next day as well, but I told them to save the money (not necessary).  Well it did come in 1-2 days anyway.The most difficult thing to determine, is whether or not you are being monitored correctly.  Our alarm went off a couple times (our fault), but we cancelled it quickly.  We never got a call from the monitoring service, but have read that they will not if you cancel it quickly with your code.  There is no reason to question whether or not it is being monitored correctly, but I do wonder, only because we have never tested the call center.  Might be worth it one of these days.Overall, I am very happy with the system.  I ordered it directly through SimpliSafe and it was less expensive than through Amazon.  In addition, I received a 10% discount by using the \"Rush\" coupon code.  It is a very affordable system that you can take with you if you ever leave, it installs easily, and I really like the features you have with it, if you sign up for the $25/month monitoring service.", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works as expected", "Author": "Vincent A.

I took my time installing the system and tried to work out the most practical way to use it. My system is fairly large with 18 door and window sensors, 2 motion sensors and 2 panic buttons. There is no way to tell the system which sensor is at any given location in the house. I figured out that each sensor has a 5 digit ID code. I created an excel spreadsheet that identifies where each sensor is located by ID code. So I now have a quick look-up when the system does alarm. What would be really nice is if you could identify each sensor location on my computer when the USB remote is plugged into the computer. If that table in the computer could be printed it would serve the same purpose with less work on my part. I love the fact that the base station talks and tells me if there is a problem with a sensor, If there is a problem with monitoring and warns me to exit when I arm the system.. I have 2 cats and they do not cause the Motion Sensors to alarm. I did not order an additional alarm siren, but I may do so since the base station alarm is not quite as loud as I would like. Most of the time I probably will not have it 24/7 monitoring so I calculate that It will take between 12 and 18 months to break even. Since I'm not locked into a monitoring contract for 2 to 3 years.

So I needed a system that could be monitored without a phone line for peace of mind about the stuff I had stored there. It needed to be reasonably priced and have no hidden fees/contracts etc. After some research I decided to try out the SimpliSafe system, and so far I couldn't be happier.The setup is a breeze, and the system was up and running in less than 10 minutes. My only complaint is that it was a little confusing that you had to set the system up online with the serial number BEFORE it would connect at all to the monitoring station. This was only a problem because I was at the garage site installing the unit and didn't have access to a computer to activate it. Most installations will be at a residence where you'll have your PC handy, so it's an issue that won't effect most people. I had to go back home, enter the info via the web, and go back to the shop to make sure that it had a connection to the monitoring station.The base unit talks you through the install, and it was actually why I knew there wasn't a connection to the monitoring station. When I tried to arm the unit and leave, it warned me that it wasn't connected to monitoring. Very cool feature and it provided me with additional peace of mind that the system makes you aware of problems if there are any.The online monitoring portal is really advanced, and shows events (i.e. \"Armed by Keychain remote at 4:14pm\", etc.) that are really useful. I have the mid-level plan ($19.99/month) that sends me alerts, and it's easy to see how the $24.99/month plan is worth the extra money if this was in a residential location. It lets you see the status of individual sensors and some other useful information.If all goes well over the next month, I'll probably purchase another (larger) system for my residence and will have the higher end monitoring plan for that location. This says a lot, since I have a top of the line Honeywell system already in place there. I hope there is some kind of discount for having multiple locations. If not (and if you are reading this SimpliSafe) then that would be a great selling point! I would also be willing to pay an annual contract price over a monthly fee if that was an option to save some money.The systems themselves can be a little pricey, but if you are comparing them to the long contracts and high monitoring cost of the local (ADT, etc.) systems then it's far cheaper. Seems like quality gear that will hold up over time.If I do end up with another unit installed in my home, I'll update the review accordingly.

After trying different systems, I opted for the SimpliSafe Home Security because it met all of my needs as well as the monitoring system was reasonably priced.  Indeed, there is no long term contract and there is three levels of service that you can select or none at all.  What was even more advantageous to me, is that I can move up or down on the monitoring levels that suit my needs.  For instance, when I am not traveling I can select the $19.95 per month monitoring which gives me text messaging of any alarms or changes to my system as well as it being monitored by a live person.  Or when I travel, I can select the $24.95 option which allows me to remotely control my system by computer or smart phone.  I can turn the system on or off, allow a person to enter my home and reactivate the system when they leave.  Another reason is the distance that the sensors reach.  I have two detached garages away from the house that are approximately 200-300 feet.  I wanted a system that would not only monitor my home but also my detached garages with one system.

We had a old Brinks system in our house that was not monitored.  Since it was not monitored, it beeped every 3-4 hours as it could not connect to the monitoring service.  We thought our only options were to go with another company and get locked into a contract or to pay to replace the computer and keypads in this system.When we found Simpli-Safe at first, we did not take it seriously.  We did not expect much out of a system that could be self installed and as this cheap, we were wrong.PROS;Up front pricing-  Pick a package and any options you want and it is yours.  No having to commit to a large package to get the features you want or getting a basic package because you can't figure the pricing structure.  If you want to add something late go online and purchase it, install it and have it.Simple pricing- They offer three packages of monitoring and all can be viewed on their site.  No extras for cellular monitoring, fire, flood, or anything else.  Pick the services you want (or none at all) and you get it.No Contract-  You can be monitored this month and not next month.  There is no $3000 3 year commitment.  You don't like the service? Turn it off. You can even return the whole system for up to 60 days.Easy to install-  Everyone says this system is incredibly easy to install and they are right.  I had my system going in under 30 minutes.  I did have a problem with the extra siren not being connected, but one call and 5 minutes later it was linked.Options - You can have smoke, CO2, flood, temperature monitoring adding by just adding the sensor.  Their is NO extra cost for the monitoring of these devices.Cellular monitoring- The system uses T-Mobile or Verizon (depending on your area) to send a cell call to there monitoring company.  Most companies charge extra for this, but this is the primary way the alerts are sent.  You can also hook it up to your broadband router or phone line as a back up (no charge).portability- I don't see this mentioned often, but this system will move with you.  Take it down, pack it up, and put it up at your new place.  I can' of many system where you can do this.CONS-The system looks less dated.  The keypad does not look current and the door sensors are huge.  Although the keypad looks dated it is pretty advanced.  Everything it in plain words and it is backlit.  It is also VERY simple to use.-Shipping is slow.  I know this is not their fault, but it is worth noting.  I paid extra for the 3-5 day FedEx Ground service and received it about a week later.  Simplisafe sent it out the next day, but FedEx days are business days (and Monday is not a business day)-Minimal options-  The system offers a lot (smoke, CO2, entry, motion, flood, and temperature monitoring), but could more farther to hit the advanced systems on the market (video, two way talk, etc).  They are working on this though.  When I purchased my system two weeks ago they were not offering glass break sensors stating they were still testing them.

It came fast, and in a 12x12x6 box. I opened up the box and the first thing you see is the basic warnings about permits and regulations (there are none in Ft Wayne, IN), in my case I got the arm/disarm remote free, removed the remote and pulled the cardboard cover out of the box (be sure to flip that board over, there are some extra peal and stick strips in a little baggy), next you see the base station wedged between packaging paper. Pull out the paper and voila everything else is in the box and ready to go.After opening everything and planning out their locations, I pealed the strips and pressed them into place, and as per the instructions beginning with the base station being installed and plugged in I started pulling the battery strips, first the keypad, then every sensor thereafter. The instructions for installing are uber easy to follow, nothing extraordinarily hard about it.The next step involved is to press the buttons on the bottom of all the sensors, doing this will cause the base station to say the name of every sensor.  The primary issue I ran into is that some of the sensors were placed on different levels and being able to hear the base station name the sensor was hard, so have a extra body helping. Also, when placing the motion sensors or extra siren be sure to keep the ladder or stepping stool near by, when I installed this system I didn't foresee needing a ladder and had to stand on the window sill (not easy). Once everything was recognized, I activated the monitoring (set primary and secondary contacts, location [location can be changed so probably perfect for renters]) Then I changed the Pin and set the alarm.

We desired one change to the software that was not in the menu, but after an e-mail to SimpliSafe's customer service, Amy sent me a software download that did exactly what we needed.We're remote, and we are essentially our own fire/police/medical service, so having a bit of extra warning out here can mean a big difference. We haven't been in a situation yet where we needed such a security system, but if we ever are, this one looks like it will do exactly what we need, if not more.

About 40 minutes later we had installed 7 entry sensors, 2 motion detectors, key pad, additional siren, a panic alarm, a smoke detector and the base unit. A week later we added 3 more entry sensors, another motion detector and a second key pad. The whole thing was ridiculously easy. Our monitoring system went live after the 72 hour practice period and we could not be happier. Put it in test mode and we got a call from the monitoring station within a minute. I love being able to program all aspects of its operation through the web site, and being able to see the alarm status as well as arm/disarm it via my iPhone.

So far I really like the system.Cost: We added quite a bit of extra sensors to cover our house and a detached building with office and shop.SimpliSafe sales and customer support said that it may not be able to reach through our thick brick walls (that are also wood framed, insulated and sheet rocked internally).  They said we could try it out and would have 60 days to return it if it did not work.So far the sensors have reached through walls and all from one side of the main house to the other over 140 feet. It also reaches all the sensors in the detached building through more walls and brick. I was hoping not to have to add another whole system for the other building. I was skeptical and was pleasantly surprised by the range of the system.Base station: Made to sit on shelf or table. Works well and has good range as mentioned above. It doesn't look that bad either.  However, it would also be nice to have at least an option for a wall mounted version that you could attach to a wall.Most messages from the system come out of the base system.  I wish those voice prompt could also come out of the extra sirens. And it would also be nice to have the option to turn off the voice prompts from the base station and specified sirens.Entry Sensors: All our have worked great. I am used to smaller wired entry sensors from previous homes. It would be nice if the battery side of the SimplySafe entry sensors was slightly smaller, but they really are not that bad and we have basically forgotten they are there. They work very well and are easy to install.Water sensors: These are easy to hookup. Basically take the tape backing off and stick them where you need them.  they worked very well when I tested them. I wish I had water sensors installed in my previous home where twice we had large water damage claims within 5 years that led to a canceled home owners policy. Pretty cheap protection.Freeze sensors: I have three installed. By thermostat in main house, back porch and shop in detached building where my golden retrievers sleep.  These work good, but I wish they would be able to be refreshed instantly from the web page or the phone app.Also, the web page shows all the sensors and their individual temperatures, whereas the phone app, only shows an average of the temperatures. that isn't very useful when wanting to log into your phone to see the outside temperatures. I would rather see a list of all the temperature (freeze) sensors that I have connected to my system so I can see inside and outside temps. I did call support and they said that was a great idea and would let their developers know, so hopefully that will be in an upcoming software update.Bear in mind, you can currently see the individual temps from the web page, just not from the phone app where I would rather access them.Smoke sensors, very easy to install.CO sensors, very easy to install.Key chains: Easy to set to \"Away\", set off immediately \"Panic\" alarm or to turn off the armed system.Motion sensors: Easy to set up. Smaller would be better, but they are about the same size as motion sensors I have used before.These use infrared to calculate temperature fluctuations caused by moving heat signatures. They \"see\" the heat outline of your body. when that moves in its field of vision the sensor is tripped. These seem to work fairly well, but at times seem not to register movement as well as some other technologies such as microwave reflecting systems.  The infrared does use less energy and thus is better suited for these battery powered models.  It might be good to also offer another motion detector with dual technologies for places where a power adapter could be employed. Another not it that they come with only one adhesive \"Command\" strip pre-mounted in the middle of the bracket. However, I have ALL of my motion detectors mounted in corners because they cover 90 degrees field of view , left to right. They provide two places to mount adhesive strips in the corners of the brackets for mounting in corners. This worked great, but you have to remove the one in the center and threw it away and then apply to more command strips in the corners.  It would be much better for them to just include two strips for each motion detector and you choose either straight ahead or corner mount yourself when installing. I will test more for their accuracy later and update this review.Glass break sensors: These are not released yet, and so I have of course not tested them. However I am looking forward o their release, because our house has many windows including a number large picture windows. To avoid tripping any of the entry sensors, an intruder may decide to just break the glass and come in through the glass door or window. The glass break sensor would catch this. The other good thing about glass break sensors is that the \"hear\" around corners or through openings/cutouts in walls. Because of not having the requirement for line of sight like most inexpensive motion detector technologies, they can potentially cover multiple rooms. SimpliSafe said they hope to have these available to purchase within the next couple months.Cameras: Also not released, yet, but SimpliSafe said they have been developed and are in testing now. They plan to have these to work with existing systems that you purchase now with just maybe a firmware upgrade.For the price and performance so far, it would be hard to beat this system. My previous alarm company that I only paid $23 a month for basic burglary and fire protection for years wanted $45 in our new house to provide the same service as SimpliSafe.  They also wanted another $1100 for the system because of additional components I wanted.I bought my base package and all the sensors (Probably double the number of sensors I would have received with the other $1100 system (It was supposedly \"free\" still I started adding what I needed.) And I would have been stuck paying $45 a month with a three year contract.No thanks.

We have noticed that when the neighbors are being interviewed by the TV news people after the crime. They often say \"I just didn't expect that to happen in our neighborhood.\" We also purchased the complete system with the above added accessories we purchased for our relatives.Installation: Simple and easy about 1 hour. 15 windows and 2 doors entry sensors.We have the $15. a month monitoring plan and it's best feature besides quick response from dispatch is the free account web page that has the \"Event Log\" you can check online any time to see if and when your system was activated, deactivated etc.We as a family have had our systems for 7 months now.Just recently we have the flashing blue light and key pad with audio notification of \"No contact With Dispatch!\" Called customer service and instead of waiting I just left a message and was called back shortly. They are sending a Verizon cell module to replace the suddenly out of range T Mobile module free. Our experience with customer service has always been excellent! They have sent free 3 defective entry sensors and 3 replacements for their new defective smoke detectors. 1 for each of our 3 systems. Nothing is perfect but the quick and caring response of SimpliSafe customer service is proof of a company worth doing business with. They backup their warranty with out hoop jumping.We are considered very senior citizens and recommend SimpliSafe for that extra sense of security and peace of mind when something goes bump in the night. We keep the remote on the bed stand for the convenience of having the panic button on it nearby. Last night 3am the flashlight vibrated off the refrigerator with a loud thump on the trash can and then on the floor. It was comforting get up and check it out knowing no one was in the house since no entry sensor was tripped. Our system is set to instant alarm with no delay now especially after helping my brother with his system testing and realizing how long 30 seconds really is. When we are in Home mode and asleep I want an instant alarm that some perp has entered our home. Our plan is lock bedroom door and jump out the window (single story home).Our contact with the monitoring service has been great and we know they are subcontracted for SimpliSafe like most of the big companies. I purposely trip the door entry when arriving home very occasionally to test their respose time. Cell phone rings with in a few seconds. We have had wired systems in the past with their $30-$40 a month monitoring fees. Thank you SimpliSafe for helping us to feel safe and somewhat secure with your affordable system and a reasonable priced monitoring fee.

ZWave based systems looked pretty cool.  Viper looked most attractive with it's flexibility and features.  But even if you aren't on a budget, the cellular base station and monitoring is very solid choice over Viper and similar systems.  Plus getting up and running was very simple and foolproof.  Others may say this system isn't as easy to setup as they advertise, but I thought it was.  The computer installation guide was crazy easy.Setup:For windows I utilize the motion sensor because the standard magnetic entry sensor wouldn't go off it someone just decided to break the window.My motion detector is facing the front two windows of my house because those are the closest to the ground.Because of where we are, the panic button with the extra siren is a safe choice.  Mount the siren outside under an overhang.  It's loud enough to get people running outside.The package I purchased came with a smoke alarm, we already have one so I put it in the basement near the steps.Didn't post the sign, no tips for intruders.Future Expansion:I am planning on getting 1 more motion detector for the basement.Freeze sensor for the basement to look after my old copper pipes.Things to get out of your head if security is the main concern:The keypad pretty lame looking compared to others but once I mounted it, it doesn't look antiquated at all.One stop shop for home automation is not worth the overhead.

Responses to my questions:1) \"...window breakage sensors are in the works and should be available for sale early next year. Details are scarce at this point in time, but if you would like to receive updates on these, you can sign up for our newsletter here: [...] Until our glass break sensors are released, we are recommending our motion sensors in rooms with large windows or glass doors because these will pickup on an entrance to the area of the motion sensor.\"2) You can purchase the Amazon package and then still purchase extra components at their website. Customer service reassured me that their \"systems purchased on Amazon will come with the same 3-year warranty (and same) ... customer support.\"3) \"You can arm the windows in an open position, as well. What you would do is put the sensor on the window, running vertically, and the magnet on the frame, running vertically. When the window is shut, the magnet should line up with the sensor and be within 2 inches of it in order to arm that window in a closed position. Then, purchase a second magnet, and place it on the window frame at the height that you want to open the window to. Then, open the window so that the sensor on the window lines up with this second magnet. You can now arm the window in this open position, and opening or closing it will trigger the alarm. Extra magnets can be ordered here: [...]I also read elsewhere that their smartphone app now has a security code for an extra layer of security and peace of mind should you lose your phone.Seriously, I am actually excited to get this. I am SO happy I came across these detailed reviews (thank you everyone; thank you Amazon) before possibly signing a contract with another service. I am particularly comforted by my initial experience with their customer service but especially by the raves it receives from others.

The installation took less than an hour.Service:The Simplisafe services is great. The ability to have no contracts, no commitments and the fact you own the equipment is the selling point for me. You can upgrade your service and downgrade your service at any time. The plans start at $14.99 a month, then $19.99 a month and lastly, $24.99 a month.Features:The system features are easy to understand, but the best feature is the mobile app. You can monitor your system from your location (as long as you have cell or wifi service). The ability to provide 4 additional pins for children or others is a great feature to use.Depending on your plan, the service will send you a text message and/or email when the alarm is armed or disarmed.Overall Views:Overall, the Simplisafe system is an excellent choice for our family.

I have never been so happy with a company before.When I opened the box to my system the first thing I seen was that SimpliSafe didn't have permit information regarding my city and the installation of their security system, after making a quick call to the City I learned that I wouldnt need a permit, and I called SimpliSafe to spread the word to them, I was greeted promptly and professionally, the agent I spoke with took her time to thank me for choosing them and welcomed me to the SimpliSafe Family.SimpliSafe, I am so glad I found you and soon my friends and family will be getting their own system.\"Alarm on, home.

I had already taken some precautions to make it harder to get in my garage doors and it seemed to work, this time. I decided to get an alarm system. I had heard the SimpliSafe system being advertised on the radio so I researched it and decided to make the purchase. Like the site says it is easy to install with no wires to run and no forced monitoring contracts. Peel and stick so no drilling or screws are needed. All my doors and windows now have sensors as well as all rooms have motion sensors. I also ordered 2 outside rated 105 decibel sirens so the whole neighborhood can hear if the alarm is tripped. My garage is not attached to the house so I was able to put a second Keypad out there along with the one in the house. Its a very modular system that is easy to add or subtract components as needed at a later date. This allows you to get a basic package and add more as you need without having to hire an installer do the installation \"work\".

I tried it out soon after I got it it took 3 min for dispacth to call after it went off so if they had to call a sheriff your looking at 5 min .Most people want hang around with the alarm blaring I'm thinking .Im sure after the 5min for the call to the cops prolly take a little while for them to get there cause from what I read its a low priority when no ones home . I'm hoping the siren will run em off . But it's alot better than nothing where they could have time too go through everything . I get text alert and e-mail alert on my phone so when I get a text I can (shoot) over there if I'm in town . But for 25 bucks a month I've got live dispacth and text alert perty cool .

Try that with a big name contract alarm system!First day of real monitoring, the alarm went off while we were away, and my wife got the call from the SS monitoring office.  We elected not to send police out, as this was our first day and knew it was likely to be our fault, not the system.  We saw an internal door with a sensor on it reported as the cause immediately on our cell phones, and knew it was unlikely to be an actual intruder. This proved true, my daughter returned home and found that door was unlatched and had blown open due to high winds through an open window.  Great to see in in action, and glad we stopped a police response, but clearly the system was doing what it should.Just had it a week or so, but love it so far.", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "SimpliSafe Alarm Systems Gets An A+ In My Book", "Author": "James S.

I contacted my current security company and they quoted me a price to upgrade to a newer system, plus an increase in monitoring costs.  The price worked out to be higher than that of purchasing a substantial kit from SimpliSafe, and their monitoring was also more expensive than SimpliSafe's most expensive plan.What sealed the deal for me was the upgrade would be tied to the house and not portable.I had been hearing SimpliSafe's advertisements for a while, but I'm pretty good at ignoring marketing until I'm ready to hear it.  As I was searching, I come across their website and was immediately engaged.  Everything looked like exactly what I needed, plus it would be portable if I ever moved.I ordered a kit and got it within a few days.  I ran into a few issues with the initial setup (bad cell signal), but both email and phone support were great in being able to quickly sort it out by helping me locate an ideal spot.  I did have one bad component that they immediately shipped overnight to replace it.When I called in phone support, I got someone in under a minute that knew EVERYTHING about the system.  Usually, I have to lead other tech support companies to what I think the problem may be and note everything I have tested, but that wasn't needed here.  The representative quickly was able to explain exactly what was going on and how to address it.While I got mine working, it is important to note that if you want to use the advanced monitoring/web features, you must be in a location that has a decent cell signal.  A landline backup will only send alarm notifications.The system works great - does exactly what I need.As far as the company goes, I am impressed - they are acting like a company that believes in their product should:Well trained customer supportQuick responses via email (business hours)No long wait time on the phoneOvernight replacements for faulty pieces60 day free trial (w/ free return shipping)They just expanded their customer support hours to include Sunday, now from Sunday - Friday from 9AM - 6PM.

We have never been burglarized, but there is always a first time. The only systems I was remotely familiar with we're ADT and the X-Finity system that Comcast is pushing heavily. I was leaning toward that system until I reviewed all of the \"free\" stuff that was actually included and realized that it was grossly inadequate plus there was a 3-year security monitoring contract. ADT was no great shakes either when you came right down to it so I checked to see what Angie's List had to say about various home security systems.  I looked at all of them.  There were only a few reviews for SimpliSafe for they were very positive. The system was not free, but the price even with a few extra sensors did not seem exhorbitant. I was especially impressed that there was no built in monitoring contract. If I wanted it, fine, but I was not locked in plus the baseline monthly cost of $14.99 seemed like a bargain compared to what others were charging which was usually in the $30 plus range.  I also liked the idea that all,of the sensors communicated wirelessly with the base unit. No hardwiring required, but would it be some half-assed Mickey Mouse system?  Well I ordered it on a Thursday since they also guaranteed I could return it if not satisfied. It was delivered complete the next Tuesday. On Wednesday I looked it over and started working thru the installation procedure. I am an engineer so following complicated instructions is second nature; however, in this case there was nothing complicated about it. Everything was clearly explained and all of the sensors were placed and the system was operational in perhaps an hour. For right now I am not securing the sensors with anything other than the adhesive strips that were  attached , but since screws were included I may do that later. We left on vacation at noon the next day. I have been going online each day and confirming that no alarms have been triggered since we left. So far I am very pleased with the system.

In the past, I've have many problems with delayed detection of flooding in my finished basement. This system sends me a text if there is water in my laundry room. Very cool. It uses the cell system with battery operated units so power failures are not a problem. I also like the iphone app. I get alerts on my phone if there is entry, water, fire... you get it. There are three levels of central monitoring. Only the highest gives you the text alerts as things happen on your system. This level costs $25 per month.

The best part besides the easy setup, is the take it when you move from place to place.Con: It's not designed to integrate with any CCTV DVR systems.

I paid for the full monitor that cost me $24.95  p/month. Again, no contract which is a plus. However, it's well priced. I gave it a 4 Star for innovation, price and easy set up.

I ordered fed-ex ground shipping which is 3-5 days and usually gets here in 3 days especially since Simplisafe is only a couple of states away.It's Thursday and I called to ask what was happening with my shipment since the tracking wasn't updated.I was told it hadn't even shipped out yet!I was told that Monday didn't count as a shipping day so as long as the order made it by next Monday it was still within the 5 business days, then I was told that since I was close by my order \"wasn't a priority\" and that they ship the further away orders as a priority.I don't care even if that is true, it's not something you should tell a customer who just spent over $1,000 with you!Priority should be to customers in line.

I needed an alarm system, but wasn't interested in spending a lot of money.  On the same hand, I wasn't going to buy junk.  I wanted a quality system.I also didn't want to drill holes in my walls, or pay for installation. I certainly wasn't going to sign any contracts. I researched and found a few wireless alarm systems and companies and began reading reviews and watching videos on YouTube.It seemed that if everything people were saying was true, SimpliSafe was the easy to install, convenient, quality system at the best price for the quality, (I think there was one or two a few bucks cheaper, but they seem to be low quality junk) and looking at SimplieSafe's Facebook page (which I always do before I choose a new company to do business with) it seemed like their service after the sale was good. That's very important to me. For the majority of my professional career I have led and managed customer service teams in various environments and can be highly critical of service organizations.  I know what great customer service looks like, so I can easily spot it when it's not there.Well, it turns out that SimpliSafe truly was everything I hoped it to be.  The system was priced really well.  I needed 8 door and window sensors and a couple of motion sensors and got a great deal.  I even got an extra keyfob to arm and disarm from my keychain. All at a great price.  Installing the entire system, every door and window sensor and doing the setup took less than 30 minutes and everything works flawlessly.  It is feature rich and high quality, but also very very simple to use. I feel secure when I am away, knowing that the extra loud siren which I also purchased is enough to scare off any intruder, and feel equally secure when I go to bed at night knowing if anyone tried to enter through my homes multiple points of entry, I'll know right away and more importantly - they'll know I know, and be gone.I've had to ask some questions of their service team a couple of times since purchase and had my questions answered cheerfully and quickly each time.I also like how, since their monitoring is \"no contract\", that I can turn it on if I ever choose, and then turn if off the next month if need be.  I don't feel as though I have a need for monitoring.  Maybe if I was in a higher crime neighborhood I would, but regardless I don't.  That being said, I like that if we are going on a week or two vacation in the summer, I can turn the monitoring on, and the next month turn it off if I want just like that.  Not to mention that the monitoring price is about the lowest in the industry and the reviews I've read of that particular service tell me all I need to know - they get the job done, notifying emergency services when appropriate - and at the end of the day, that's all that matters.All in all, I would recommend this system to anyone in the market for home security.  When it comes to a particular service, product, or company I ask this question: \"Would I recommend it to my mother.\"  With SimpliSafe, I wouldn't hesitate.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Toy security system", "Author": "devexpert", "ReviewID": "RV24MAJBSLRE3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this system from manufacturer directly and installed it which was very easy.

I started to unbox the system and got stuck on step 1... remove the base unit from the box and remove the battery activation strip. The base unit I received had no battery activation strip. I plugged it in and the batteries were dead. These are rechargeable batteries but they thing even after left plugged in won't work and hold a charge.So at this point I have a bunch of pieces of plastic around the house and nothing to do with them.I tried to contact simplisafe via the customer service number and conveniently their offices are closed on Saturdays.Initial impressions, this is a bad system based on the fact I can't use it, at all. Now, if they \"fix\" my issues then perhaps things will turn around, but I expect reimbursement for my Saturday delivery and new batteries to be shipped to me before that happens.---UPDATE 12/2/13---I purchased new batteries at my local store and got the alarm working. Simplisafe believes that based upon that the power adapter is bad and not the batteries they shipped. They are overnighting me a new power adapter and have given me a free month of monitoring for the trouble. I'll do a full review update once the new adapter arrives.--UPDATE 12/30/13---I forgot to come back and update my review, my apologies! The new adapter arrived a few days after simplisafe shipped it (shipped it on a weekend so as expected took a few extra days). The new adapter fixed my issues and I have not had a single issue since. The sensors are mounted on my doors, I even was able to mount one to my garage door so when it opens it triggers the chime inside.Simplisafe stepped up and fixed my issue, diagnosed what I thought was dead batteries correctly as a dead power supply. They gave me credit for a month of service for the inconvenience and really have been a great company to have protecting my house. No complaints at all and I am working on getting more adapters from them to totally replace my old ADT system.

SHING", "ReviewID": "R2DGFIVZ92E9R7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought a refurbished Simplisafe 2 alarm system at March 14, 2014  from their website since their supporting crew claimed it still offers the very same product warranty but at reduced prices.  I returned the entire system at April 14, 2014 through their prepaid label and collected 100% full refunds by April 24, 2014 without the 1st month monitoring service charges.  Here are the pros and cons of Simplisafe 2 alarm system based on my 3+ weeks usages.Pros1. All sensors are very easy to install which is no difference than other brands but their hardware setup utility, Microsoft window based , is very easy and friendly to use which is a big plus.  You can use the USB keyfob to program your system on the computer, then sync with base station which makes reconfigurations of your alarm system extremely easy.2. Door/window sensor is responsive and no false alarm ever occurred during the 3+ weeks usages3. Supporting crews are knowledgeable and responsive4. 60 days tryout is a plus and you will get 100% full refunds if you do not like your purchaseCons1. Very limited range allowed between base station and wireless keypad, say less than 15 feet and supporting crew confirmed this info.  If you have the sound enabled for your base station, then the base station becomes a easy target for intruders to locate once they knew smacking the keypad did not crash the alarm system.2. Very slow and environmental subjective motion sensor.  It will take 2 minutes to warm up and any warm bodies better be away during the warm up period in order not to affect the \"decision\" making of the motion sensor and I learned this through the supporting crew.  The problem is wireless window sensor is not suitable for bathroom window due to humidity issue and you will use the motion sensor instead.  It becomes a issue with this very environmental subjective motion sensor which heavily depends on where you place it since lights through the window might trigger it.3. SMS text alert provided by their monitoring service is highly questionable.  I experienced \"no message, delayed by half day message, no message, delayed by 8 minutes, no message\" during the 2+ weeks monitoring service period on my Samsung Note 3.  However, the message will be received at your smartphone within 40 seconds if it works properly.  Their crews only acknowledged the initial no message issue since due to their system but blamed the rest were caused by my ATT carrier.  However, my wife shared the very same ATT carrier with me and she only experienced \"no message, delayed by half day message, delayed by 8 minutes\" on her Apple 5S.  I highly doubts it is the ATT carrier.4. Smartphone APP is very bare bone which only allows user to arm/disarm and view event logs.  No real time sensor status at all.5. There will be no 3rd party monitor services available for Simplisafe proprietary alarm system.  So, you either go with their non-reliable monitoring service or no monitoring service at all.Note: item 3 and 5 are the main reasons for me to return the entire system since I would not mind paying the monthly service charges but the services need to be 100% reliable.6. Hardware costs are in par with other name brands but the system does not allow any future expansions of either video or home automations.ConclusionsIf you are in the market for very straight forward alarm system to install by yourself without worrying about the monitoring services, then Simplisafe might suit your needs.  But, if you are in the taste of future expansions of video, home automation, then the simplicity of Simplisafe product is at its cost.Will I recommend Simplisafe to anyone?  The answer is YES if user falls into these categories as such:1. Constantly on the move since the entire system allows you to carry around like other wireless alarm system2. No needs for professional monitoring services at all since why pays for non-reliable monitoring services3.

If you put yourself in the eyes of a burglar, this system is easier to break even for a first timer. Simplisafe system is as easy to break it, as easy it is to install it.This is only good, just to have a burglar system for the sake of having it. Does it give the peace of mind that you are looking for after spending time and money, absolutely NO. In fact, I would advise not even advertising that there is a Simplisafe system through window and door decals. Any burglar who reads this review, will not only know how to break it through Simplisafe system, but will also target houses that have Simplisafe systems. So please do not make yourself an easy simplisafe target.Cons========1. Simplisafe Home mode can be set only from the key pad.2. Biggest flaw of the Simplisafe system: Motion Sensors--2a. Motion sensors are effective only in the direction they are facing and have to be within human height to detect motion.--2b. Motion sensors placed between 5\" and 6\" are easy to remove. Not only can they be removed, but also unpowered by removing the battery and the Simplisafe system will not recognize that.--2c. Motion detectors are effective only in the direction they are facing; hence one can come from the side and remove them, effectively making it useless.3. Base station, in spite of setting for NO voice alerts. Does give out voice alerts making it vulnerable to its location and a burglar can easily smash/break it from sending the signal.4. An alert activated by a control (motion or contact) will not send an SMS unless it is past the few seconds time (about 30 sec) when the alert signal is sent to the monitoring station.4. In continuation of the point 4. You will not know what control triggered an alert if the alarm system is switched off prior to sending an alert to the monitoring station.5. Alarm system gets activated, even when one of the door contacts is NOT in command mode, violating the basic principles of an alarm system.6. When in alert mode (home or away) the system still take time to activate the siren for any activation by motion sensor, again violating the basic principles of alarm system. Since it is an alert by a motion sensor that is usually inside a home, there should not be any time gap.7. No way to know, if the system is back up and running after an alert, unless you pay extra for online command.8. The siren is virtually sound less, if one puts a hand on it.9. No way to know specifically the order and which control triggered an alert when an alert does gets to the monitoring station. The system only says a generalized motion sensor or door control triggered the alarm.Pros=====1. Text alerts when subscribed are good2. Door contacts work effectively.3. Easy way to control through PC which control to put in away or home mode and control the time and pass codes.Overall: 1.5/5", "Date": "July 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Looks and sounds good but better for the $$ is out there", "Author": "MB", "ReviewID": "R3MEZZCMCVQ52J", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This was our first security system. I bought it on trial because it was recommended by Dave Ramsey and many other trusted sources.It is very easy to setup..yes.The basic plan every month is very cheap...yes.There are no contracts....yes.Aside from that, the extremely bad feedback from users on IT'S FORUM, the Simplisafe forum, is extraordinarily unbelievable. It's alarming that they allow customers to put bad feedback on there last week, the week I got ours, and just let it go without defending or explaining. People were complaining about not getting texts until HOURS after the alarm had been tripped. Or not getting calls at all. Just really, really bad customer service from their one call center. I'm not going to pay someone to watch my house that can't even watch THEIR forum. It's going back. Yes, there are some diehard fans on there. But I've found other products that have better customer service AND products for just a little more money.I've went with another company that has better products (touch screen panel and better smoke detectors and alarms, more solid and not flimsy plastic. More industrial stick tape on back, not 3M. And the new company has 3 call centers so in case one like SS has went down, I still get coverage. And, they have chat support which SS doesn't have.Sidenote, I bought it through a Woot ad that Amazon sent in my email. I'm trying now to get my money back because it came with a '60 day' trial. Woot said they wouldn't honor that and suggested I sell it to a coworker ? lol. Amazon is working nicely with me to get my money back.So, in the end, buyer beware of Simplisafe AND Woot.I will say that I love having a security system in my home now.

When I bought the system I thought I would be able to get an alarm notification sent to either my phone or a neighbors w/o using their service. Other systems do this and in many cases its preferable to have a \"neighborhood watch\" or other local entity filter notifications to the police and avoid false alarms. This system does not appear to accommodate this and you are required to pay the monthly service fee of $20 to use their alarm notification service.  I would not have bought the system had I understood that I couldn't have alarm notifications sent to my own or neighbors email or text message address w/o using the Simplisafe service. The hardware exists within their system to do this and I suspect this is a business decision to force users to pay a monthly service charge.

Tech support has told me to move the system components around until they work (they can't say exactly what works).  I don't have a lot of freedom to move them from their convenient locations in my small house.  They refuse to give me a refund 60 days after the purchase (the 1st problem took more than that to show).

They've had two years to solve the problem and have failed.Recently they are selling a $10/month upgrade that includes texting and emails.  I feel those features will reduce calls to their emergency line and would actually save them money if they gave them away.
