{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Decent System For Price", "Author": "TRIndy", "ReviewID": "R2OMQZK9SESTAG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This DVR works really well. I purchased one as a gift and one for myself a few weeks ago. They've both been running and recording continuously for  2 weeks. The user interface on the DVR is very simple and easy to use, unlike some other DVR brands that have a poorly designed user interface. The remote pc and mobile phone interface also works great. This DVR allows you to set up recording on all cameras at the D1(highest cctv) resolution, but you have to adjust the frame rate depending on how many cameras are recording. On one system, I have 6 cameras recording continuously at D1, with 5 cameras at 10 frames/sec and 1 camera at 19 frames/sec. If I added a couple more cameras, I'd have to reduce the frame rate a little on each camera to still record at the D1 resolution. All-in-all, a great system for the price.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good product...not too good instructions..", "Author": "Cristian", "ReviewID": "RQC6ZNI7QM0V9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hard to configure the internet connection without going to the zmodo.com support site.

The main thing you want with a security camera system is something that \"just works\". It has to be reliable. My Foscam camera had to be rebooted almost every day, which made it useless, and after 2-3 months it stopped worked completely.I've only been using this ZModo system for about a week, but it's recording constantly and hasn't had any issues thus far. Setup was pretty easy, although the GUI and menus look like they were designed in the 90's. The network setup was also pretty easy if you know what you're doing. The only weak point on this camera for me is the web interface. It ONLY seems to work with IE 9+ (not Chrome or anything else) and it requires you to change some ActiveX security settings to get the applet to install. But once it's working, it works pretty well. On the other hand, however, I works flawlessly on a camera monitoring app I have on my Android phone.Image quality on the cameras is good enough, especially for the price. I do wish they were a little more wide angle, though. You need a lot of cameras to cover a large area.Overall this seems to be a reliable system (so far) and is a good deal for the price. I recommend it.", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Surveillance Camera System", "Author": "Mr.Shadetree", "ReviewID": "R2TFR2ANBFI3G7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this product about a month,every thing working as its supposed to. Very easy to set up had to buy extra length wire as included wire (60') not long enough for 2 cameras. Great quality pictures & good infared night vision.

It is OK as far a quality.Cameras are not super clear, but they do a pretty good job at night. All of the reviews about difficulty in setting up the remote view and phones/tablets are spot on. The issue is that the tutorial Zmodo provides misses a couple of key steps. The Tech support to 40 minutes of waiting to get through, but once they picked up the guy was very friendly and professional and got it up and running in minutes.I will add that most product I reviewed before buying this one also had complaints about the difficulty of getting their internet and apps up and running.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just the basics", "Author": "AZHOOSIER", "ReviewID": "R26VQ9UYW3UCVJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Should have done some more research before purchasing.  Works fine but the cameras are very low end and have a very limited range at night.  If you are just looking for a basic system this will work for you.
