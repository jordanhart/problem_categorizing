The smart phone app also works great with a super picture.  However, one new problem exists when \"tweaking\" the motion and sound setting.  The website requires the use of java and it worked fine in the past overlooking the expired/invalid certificate.  But I recently added a timer to a light fixture my living room which trigers the motion detector.  So when I tried to \"block out\" the light fixture coverage part of the screen, this neat window motion feature wont open after the new java update (Ver 7, update 51).  I followed the exception instructions found under the D-Link FAQ without success. The D-Link website certificate is invalid/expired and the recent java update will not allow an override.  However, my biggest gripe is no Customer Service phone support.  i hate having to explain my problem via email and getting an automated response.  So far, it has been a week with no reply or resolution. So my best advise for any technology purchase is to check the company website first to see if they offer phone support.

Great price for what is advertise", "Author": "Serg", "ReviewID": "R39GRPT1LMDBML", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "People your expectations are way to high for this camera. If price wasn't an option, you would of spent thousands of dollars for a top notch security system. Does this camera record in HD quality? NO! So what! We all at some point have owned a VHS or DVD before and the picture looks fine. Man aren't we all a bit spoiler by the luxuries in life.DO NOT BELIEVE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!!!!!!!!! THIS CAMERA WORKS GREAT FOR ITS PURPOSE!!!!!!I've owned this camera for over a week and I have this bad boy overlooking my back porch right now. I have been looking to add a wireless camera surveillance system for a while without having to shell out thousands of dollars. I own 3 DLink cameras without any issues and the setup was easy. (Note: I currently have 40mbps down with my internet provider so my experience may be a bit different than others.) I just needed to contact support to help me to set up the email settings when I had motion detection enabled. I had no issues what so ever contacting support unlike others.Although these cameras is supposed to be indoors I have two of them outside mounted but under shade.The motion detection can be a bit sensitive so you are going to have to play with it for a while to find the right setting. I currently have mine setup to send me an emAil every time motion is detected. I also have it setup to send me a picture and video when motion is detected. I have a yahoo email that I never use so I have the emails being sent there.As far as the app goes Dlight, I have an android phone and an ipad. The app is free on mobile devices and 99 cents for the ipad. They both have the same functionality for except that the ipad you can view multiple cameras onto the screen. So when I'm on the road I can check on the family with my phone and when I'm in the house I have my ipad open up displaying all 3 cameras!!!!  This by far is the best cost effective way for video surveillance!!!!Pros:Cost effective. Average camera will run you at least $150!!!! Cameras with ADT will probably cost more than thatSend video and images to any emailCan setup a schedule of when you want motion detection.Wireless. Easy setup. No networking skills needed. Follow instructions. Don't need a Dlink router to workPicture quality is decent. No HD but you pay for what you get. I'd say it's about VHS qualityHas a decent range to detect motion. Roughly 15 ftThe app works great on both tablet and droid. I can view remotely on either wifi or 4g signalConsVideo length of image taken. About 7-11 secondsDlink website needs either google chrome or Firefox to work.Constant emails with false motion detections can get annoying after a while but you get use to it. Now a days we arealways glued to our phones anyway :-)The camera tends to disconnects a couple of times during the day. Believe it or not this is not a big deal. The camera doesn't shut down and restart. It just loses connectivity to your wireless router for a second. Keep in mind if you have any interference in your house this can happen often. Microwave, house phones etc.The only reason you will know this happens is because you will receive an email. It happens so fast you won't even realize it. It's not an issue with the camera itself. This is usually normal with any other electronic device. Pcs, tablets, xbox, etc.Overall 8.5/10Keep up the good work DLink!!!!!", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera for the Price", "Author": "William \"Skeptic AstroImager\"", "ReviewID": "R1VEH6IA88PBWQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a bunch of these and overall they are nice cameras, certainly nice for the price....Pros:1) Inexpensive, I have found them for mid $60 range both on Amazon and elsewhere.2) Easy setup, even w/o using D-Link software. Recognize that one does need some network knowledge for any IP camera.3) Good IR night for a camera of this cost. IR works well out to about 30 feet.4) Does one thing that many cameras, including other D-Link cameras, will not. That is do an ftp upload AND file overwrite.  I need to do this for a website and nearly none of the other cameras will do both timed ftp and overwrite to keep a current  still updated on a webpage.Cons:1) Not a high res. image, just 640 x 4802) Focus is manual and image is not super clear, most likely due to cheap optics. I also  have a much more expensive Panasonic (also 640 x 480) that has a good lens and is  much clearer. But you get what you pay for and at this price high quality optics are not  likely. Image is quite adequate  for a general overview of a scene but don't expect to  read a license plate or recognize faces beyond about 15 feet from the camera.3) Can be a bit glare prone depending on the lighting.I have not tried the motion detection so can't comment on that.And see my review on FOSCAM and why not to buy one of those.....", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "A Good Basic Camera", "Author": "Anthony O.", "ReviewID": "R20BWK6HRFG8QS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off I think rating the camera a 4 Star is being a bit generous.  I would have liked to rate it a 3 1/2 star.  But oh well..Somethings about the camera:- Easy Setup.  Granted I have a bit of Tech Knowledge but overall I found the product to be easy to set up and pretty easy to navigate the menus.- The wireless distance is pretty good, and that is without the Extender feature enabled.  I have 1 camera in my garage and my router is in the basement.  This is probably a distance of 30 feet with a floor separation.  I did purchase a \"No-Name\" Chinese brand and found the wireless to be horrible on it!  So I was happy that I was able to get a good signal.- DAY VISION - Inside during the day I get a good picture.  I also get a good picture when pointing the camera outside during the day, going through 2 windows.  Granted the image distance isn't the greatest. But you are able to make out a car model and description if need be.- NIGHT VISION - Inside with the night vision set the image is decent.  With tweaking you can get a good image up to 10 feet.  The Night vision going through a window is useless!  The IFR lights reflect back from the glass and produce a total useless image. But that is to be expected.  I have found that when going through the glass at night (depending on how much outside light there is) if set to Day Vision the camera can produce an ok picture.- I have not done much with the dLink Software.  Most of the reviews kind of pan it so I have yet to try it.  From my Android Apps I have been pretty lucky using IP Cam.  There is a freeware and paid version that works pretty well with the dLink camera.  I am also using it on my DCS-930L Camera.- My biggest gripes are the optics.  The optics on the camera are a bit to be desired.  You can manually focus the lense on the camera.  But I have found that to be a real pain in the butt! Just the slightest touch throws the camera out of focus.  Changes to either video or image quality also seem to be a bit tempermental.  Most image changes will cause the camera to go out of focus (or in focus) and then after 30 seconds the lens will reset itself again.  This is going on a wireless connection.  I will have to try it on a wired network to see if the camera replicates the problem.  Beyond 5 feet the image will start to lose some of its clarity.- While using compression h.264 and switching back to mjpeg my browser will crash on me.  I am using IE 10 on Windows 7.- I have not used Sound detection yet.  The motion detection seems to be ok.  But it will cause a flood of images to my FTP server when it does detect something.I am hoping that some of the bugs dLink will fix with their next firmware upgrade (I hope)  And maybe add some additional changes, such as -Being able to change the default admin account.  Knowing the login name is half the battle in cracking a system. A camera uptime status would be nice.  As well as log features.  Logins, Logouts, Auduting changes, device changes, etc.Overall its a nice little camera that has some pretty decent features for the price.  Some of the things that I want out of a camera this just won't meet the need.  But for a inside security camera it works.  After I play around some more and get it permanently fixed I will update my review.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "easy setup", "Author": "Eddie Yu", "ReviewID": "R296UVMIUU4VVA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I spent two weekends trying to get Foscam FI8910W set up with remote viewing and email notification on motion and sound detection.

I'll be honest, I was curious about what the dog does while we're not there (short answer: very little). If I find a good way to use this thing as a security camera, then that would be its eventual purpose.  But for now, I'm just intrigued by the wireless camera technology.Unfortunately, in practice it leaves something to be desired.  First of all, 640x480 has not been an acceptable resolution for ANYTHING since 2002. I can't possibly see how it would be difficult to bump up the resolution to at least four times that.Secondly, the focus ring in front of the lens is twitchy.  Yeah, you can get a pretty good focus on it but just by taking your finger off, it shifts the focus.  It's really tough to get it just right.Third, the software is frustrating.  I've tried panning around on my iPhone 5 and on my iPad (3rd gen), and in both cases it's really slow.  Click the button, wait several seconds, click the button again, etc.  It's slightly faster on wifi, but even LTE is rough. Sometimes the software just gives up on me and it won't register my presses at all.Updating the firmware for the device cannot be done over a wireless connection.  You need to uninstall the device from its location, bring it to your router and connect it to your network via ethernet in order to do the update.It's not all bad... I mean, the infrared night mode works surprisingly well, the wide angle of the lens is excellent -- I can see the entire living room by panning only twice. Maybe I'm just expecting something that's beyond this price range. But I feel like I should WANT to use it, but in reality I dread it because the image quality is poor and the mobile software makes you want to tear your hair out.", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Image quality is ok, software is basic, remote control of pan and tilt sluggish.", "Author": "C. Weaver", "ReviewID": "R36UEKJZNSVTJH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The DCS-5020L is not very small, 5.5\" tall and a 4\"diameter base. As seen in the photos it has a nonremovable 3.75\" stiff antenna and on the back a 12v 1A power port, an Ethernet jack, recessed reset button (paperclip size), and a WPS sync button. Two LEDs on the front indicate WPS and Power.The camera housing itself has a tripod compatible thread on the base and also included is a wall mountable stand for the camera.Setup is fairly easy but not obvious. First I used the WPS push button to add to WiFi, otherwise you will need to connect the Ethernet port, go to the internal webserver using the DHCP address your router assigned to it. But to configure mydlink cloud access you need to go to [...] to configure and add to your mydlink account. Other dlink devices have the mydlink configuration built into the webserver configuration page and since I didn't read the manual at first I was lost for a bit... If you have a dlink zero configuration router, then all of this is much easier, just go to [...] and your camera will be waiting for you. However this site is java based which can be a little tricky on a mac.Image quality is ok with a max resolution of 640x480, 3Mbps, and 30 frames per second. Unfortunately the lens in the camera has a short depth of field which appears to be about 10ft. The camera has a manual focus ring which you will need to set for your environment. If you have close and far objects to cover not all will be in focus as you pan and tilt around. It is also difficult to get the focus set right as there is a significant delay in the live image and the night time mode will switch on with your fingers next to the sensor which is la much softer (less sharp)l and the image will fog up as the IR is reflected off your hand.While the tilt offers a nearly straight up position, if you mount the camera high without the bracket, like sitting it on top of a bookshelf, you will probably be very disappointed in the camera's ability to tilt down. Although the camera can physically handle a 40degree downward angle with no obstruction of the image, the software control only allows the camera to tilt down 20degrees. I was able to work around this by manually rotating the camera ball down after the camera resets its home position on power up, this tricked the camera into thinking that 20degrees down was looking straight ahead and I could then tilt down in software another 20 degrees from that. However on any power outage or if I tilt the camera straight up, the camera recalibrates the range of motion and I lose the ability to look down a full 40degrees until I manually rotate the ball down from the home position again. Note that you will want the base to be completely level or panning will no longer work properly as the up and down angle will change as it rotates.If you mount the camera on the included base upside down on the ceiling the the tilt function would work out just fine. You simply set the image to flipped in the configuration and it changes the up and down directional controls so it all works very naturally.Rotational panning is nearly +- 180 for a nearly 360 degree view, with only about 5 degrees not being able to be reached in the very back, however with a 40degree field of view you can cover the entire area.While the pan and tilt is smooth, the remote control via direct web page, cloud web page, or app is not. You have to press in short bursts which can take a while for wide movements. You can change the amount moved each time you press but that will reduce your ability to stop on a specific point with accuracy. you can also assign set points for one touch movement to specific locations which is the best way to use the remote access control.Audio quality is useable and while the camera itself is fairly quiet (but certainly not stealth) the sound of the motors over the internal mic is quite loud. dlnk should have put in an auto mute when the camera is remotely controlled.The camera has automatic motion and audio sensing but does not track movement on its own. Auto detection can be set to trigger an image or video to email or ftp to a server. Another interesting software program to use for security is D-ViewCam, it doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere in the documentation or support links, you can read about it here [...] but no link to download, you can get it here [...]MyDlinkLite is the free OS app that is mentioned in the documentation, but again there is a D-ViewCam app available as well.", "Date": "August 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pleasantly Surprised", "Author": "Jenna of the Jungle", "ReviewID": "RNKGJ446YHVY0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was concerned after reading the reviews here that the image quality would be bad and out of focus and that I'd have trouble remotely adjusting the camera.

I love that I can adjust remotely, which has worked perfectly for me, and the single reason I'm deducting a star is noise-- it's very noisy when it adjusts up and down! Side to side is just a minor sound, but if you try to adjust the camera up or down, there's a loud buzz. If you're trying to monitor covertly (or monitor a sleeping child), you sure don't want a loud buzz announcing yourself!This is not waterproof, so you're limited to using it only indoors.

As others have stated, the 5010 has some serious issues in regard to motion sensing and D-link does not seem to have a solution. When I first used my 5010, D-link had a great app for Android tablet that allowed me to monitor my cameras from my Samsung Galaxy Tab2. It worked very well.

A couple things I dont like about it. The pan and tilt function is not continuous you have to push the arrow the way you want it move and if your lucky the app will take the input ( more often than not it dosent though) When it does it only moves a very short distance. (I have it set to the longest distance it will go) im useing it to monitor two areas in my living room and the adjacent breakfast nook ( and kitchen) its never pointed the way I  need and it takes at least 10 pushes to move it between the two areas. You can set up waypoints that it will move to quickly but the are not accessable from the mobile app that I use (when it works) 98% of the Time. My second complaint is the mobile app they work good when I am lucky enough for it to actually connect. 6 times out of 7 ( on average) it fails to link up. It tries for 10 or 15 sec to link then tells you its unable to. So you you have to keep pushing relink for 90 sec ( thats when I give up and call hopeing my mom will answer (She has  dementia which is why I try to  check in on her.

The zoom is only through the software and when you \"zoom\" on the software the image is very blurry because it just enlarges the picture on your computer in the same small window but does not actually zoom.  The Pan and Tilt of the PTZ function works pretty good though.  The advanced settings from mydlink.com opens a new window in which you have to install the h.267 java plug in.  Good luck with that.  Also, the advanced settings page opens another live view with better controls for Pan and Tilt.  The main or first page from mydlink.com with live view that has the PT control is horrible.  Its a small circle with Up Down Left and Right but the circle gets bigger when you hover your mouse over it then goes back to small after you click a direction prompting you to move your mouse out of the circle then back into the circle to enlarge it and click a direction.

Popov", "ReviewID": "R1P855G37DPPVY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "UPDATE 2/25/2014  DLink today released new firmware for the camera, which apparently resolves the software incompatibility with the current version of Java (Java 7 release 51). The firmware update process was painless and took about 5 minutes to complete on a fast Internet connection. Everything seems to be working fine now. Still, one can't use the camera on a Windows RT device as it requires \"desktop mode\" and the browser plugin is still ActiveX for the MyDlink web site for live view, so the limitations explained in my original review still apply. And DView Cam desktop software still has not been updated. I'm adding one extra star to my rating (now 3). If the desktop software is updated to address the UAC issue, I will add one more star. If the browser support becomes HTML 5 and not require Java and ActiveX plugins, it will become a 5 star product (in its class and price range).Original review below - all still accurate, except the software incompatibility with the latest Java release .51 has been resolved via the latest firmware update.Having just returned a better specified (and a better hardware) HD IP Swann camera, because its software left a lot to be desired (could not view via browser only, did not work on Windows phone, mainly), I bought the D-Link 5020L. The reason - at almost 1/3 the cost, it looked like it would do the job (less the 720p HD video of the Swann). Based on reviews, the D-Link had a built-in web server, so it could be accessed via browser only. Yes, it does, but it turns out the plugins are incompatible with current Java versions and the most important stuff (motion detection and other alert setup) relies on these plugins. I was, after some struggle, able to view the camera over the Internet via browser only, but only on a full-fetured PC by enabling \"compatibility mode\" in Internet Explorer.There is also a D-Link web viewer that uses the D-Link service (separate from the direct connection to the camera), which works well, but lacks the setup features - one has to still go to the camera directly to setup stuff.There is a built in \"wireless repeater\" in the camera - basically, extends your wireless access point's range. Nice - you can put the camera a bit away from the access point (router) and with the extender enabled, you can cover areas in your house that were previously out of your WiFi rance, for other devices to use. For instance, in one of our upper bedrooms I barely get my wi-fi signal. With the camera a few feet closer to that bedroom than my router is, I get better signal up there. Drawback - the repeater seems to slow down my internet connection (normally it is around 20-30 mb/s where I sit without the extender, it is half that if I connect to the extender enabled (my computer picks that up instead of my router, but there is an option to have the extender use a different SSID, so the two can be separately accessed).The desktop software has two major flaws: (1) It insists on disabling User Access Control (UAC) in Windows. Unacceptable, because many other applications need that to be enabled to work. OK, I could live with manually turning UAC on and off as needed, but that should not be necessary and is a security concern! Second (2), the desktop software does not control all settings - you still have to go through the web interface directly to the camera, and as mentioned above, it does not work with current version of Java. So, effectively, the desktop software does not work either! Only way to make it work is to use an older version of Java, such as 7 update 40 (which is somewhat unsafe and superceded by a dozen updates to date).The Windows Phone application works (very limited functionality) and I was excited initially that I could see my camera from anywhere. However, the update of the screen is painfully sow and half the time does not respond to commands.I managed to enable email alerts and the cam does a decent job of motion detection and emailing clips and images when triggered. Again, to setup the alerts, one needs to go through the camera web interface, whcih as mentioned only works with outdated versions of Java.Lastly, the software (except the camera embedded web server) works poorly on small tablets, such as Dell Venue Pro 8. It works better with a mouse, but with touch it is not good - it requires you to run in the desktop mode (so it won't even run on Windows 8 RT versions) and insists on running in full screen, thus preventing you from using your onscreen keyboard (workaround, flip to portrait mode, use the keyboard, then flip to landscape more again). The directional controls are next to impossible to use on the D-Link web viewer on a 8\" screen touch device without a mouse - they require you to \"mouse over\" to activate, which obviously is not possible without a mouse... Trying to play back a recorded video on a 8\" touch display - darn nearly impossible to find the video in the tiny log display in the desktop app, then if you do manage to highlight the video (which is pin-head sized visually, literally, about as big as a \".\" on the screen), you can play it fine. I did not even see the \".\" for a while, pulling my hair trying to find the recorded videos - I just did not see the tiny red dot indicating that at this time there was a video recorded... Has no one of your testers been using this on a tablet, D-Link????The browser direct viewing (and setup of the camera) via its built-in web server does not work on Windows Phone 8 - requires ActiveX plugins and/or Java, so the only way to see it there is with the D-Link app (free).On the plus side, setup was very easy with the D-Link included software. Easier than the already easy Swann camera. And the software was nice visually (not the ugly stuff on the Swann). Still, after the basic setup is done, the important functions are not that intuitive, unless you have some computer background, and as mentioned, would not work with systems that are up to date on their patches!The image quality is OK for a VGA camera. Colors are not that great, night view is fine for up to about 20 feet. Focus is manual only. Night vision can be turned on and off manually and automatically (unlike the Swann, which was only automatic). The IQ on the 720p Swann was considerably better, but the D-Link is fine to see the cats moving and figure out what they are up to. Face recognition might be an issue unless you are close to the camera (5-10 feet) as there is too much noise redution going on (the Swann was much better at that, with nicer colors too).If D-Link updates the software, this came would be fine. As it is, it is only half-usable. As it is, it is fine for a basic home web cam, but not for a security cam with alerts and motion detection and recording of footage on-site (no SD card) or via the included software (as mentioned - incompatibility with new stuff).", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love the PT option", "Author": "Mark O'Dell", "ReviewID": "RSD82R039NV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera works great, better than expected.

The picture in color is so-so, and night vision is clear so long as you don't zoom in, which gets pixelated. And be sure to adjust the focus with the bevel on the front of the camera and you will have a good picture... BUT...The set-up is a nightmare. I am usually very good with these things, and it took an hour on the phone with tech support to get it to work, and even then, they stopped trying when they thought it was a router problem. My WPS wasn't connecting, I couldn't get it to communicate even when I chose my network, and on top of it all, I couldn't remember the password to my router.Tech support walked me through forwarding the camera's port (I have done general port-forwarding before, but this was a little trickier since it had to be done through the camera's ip page) and then they wanted to change the settings on my router, but I couldn't remember the password, so they just told me what to do once I got into my router settings. Turns out I reset my router (and set the wireless up with the same name and password so I wouldn't have to reset all my devices) and the camera linked prefectly. Forwarding the camera from .20 to .140 was the key. If I had any advice for people buying this camera, it would be to print the manual out before you try to install... it doesn't come with the camera, but is very helpful.All in all, this camera is a good value and does what it is supposed to, and I think now that I have gotten this one set up, I could add others with ease. Tech Support overall WAS very helpful, and I have to give them a lot of credit for their patience, since they can't see what's going on on your screen!

This 5020L model has a wide angle lens as well as other features such as pan, and tilt. I enjoy having those additional features more than I thought I would. Other reviews point out the negative of the camera having a fixed zoom lens which can be adjusted manually by turning the focus ring on the front of the camera. Sure it would be great if it automatically focused or even if you were able to control the focus remotely but honestly it's not that big of a deal for my uses. If the room was perhaps 30' or larger such as a banquet hall I could see this being an issue but not so much for an average size room.Pretty straight forward setup once you become familiar with their software. The included recording software isn't bad either. I've been in IT for 20 years and it's obvious to me DLink made a lot of effort to remain very flexible with its options and they have done pretty well. There are many options to have snapshots sent directly from the camera to an email address or FTP server. Same with video clips and all can be configured to do so by motion activation or scheduled. A feature I found very useful is the ability to define in the camera's view an area you can define to set the activation. Example: in both camera's while I can see the majority of the room I defined a small area on the entrance doors to be monitored. The result is people just moving around in the room do not set off the recording until the camera sees the door open or someone walks in-between the camera and the defined area.I do wish it had PoE (Power over Ethernet) so I could do away with the AC adapters, this is the only reason it didn't get the 5th star.

Dorking around with the firewall settings and a DynamicDNS account in order to be able to connect to the camera from work took a couple days of trial and error but it wasn't too bad considering I had never done it before.Don't buy it solely for the motion detection if it is going in a room whose light is changed by the outside ambient light.

This is a good security/monitoring solution with relatively easy setup and good performance.Setup took about 15 minutes by someone who is technologically capable but definitely not a computer genius.  I would say it's about as easy to setup as a typical home wireless router.  It's not something you just plug in and forget, but if you can follow instructions you can get this working.Once you've got it installed, there are a lot of ways of getting at your camera.  The web interface is a little trying--it requires six or seven approvals of the java client (and installing java), but it does work pretty well.

Since my set up was so easy, I thought I would share my experience, in case it helps anyone.First of all, this is my third dlink cloud camera, so I have experience with the set up process. I already have a dlink account. I have a 932L camera and a 942L as well.  My Netgear router has WPS, which is the best way to connect.I knew my new camera was due to arrive today, so last night I downloaded the user manual from the dlink website. I read through to the installation instructions, so I was familiar with the procedures. I found a link (in the manual) for the installation wizard, so I downloaded the wizard to my computer. I ran the wizard last night (just a few of the steps) to get familiar with it, then I closed it out.Tonight, all I did was plug the camera in to the wall, push the WPS button on back of camera for ten seconds, push the WPS button on the router, and the wireless connection was made in less than a minute. Then I ran the installation wizard on my computer (that I downloaded from the internet last night), which adds the camera to my dlink account. Once I set it up, I logged in to my dlink account. The camera required a firmware update, so I went ahead and updated (I clicked the update button...so easy). Make sure you connect an Ethernet cable to your camera and then to the router for the firmware update. For some reason, you cannot update via wifi. Once I updated, I disconnected the Ethernet and was back to wifi connection.I am happy with the picture quality, for the price. Can't expect HD quality at standard pricing. The pan and tilt work quite well. I use the free iPhone app (dlink lite) and it works good. I can pan and tilt from the iPhone app.I am extremely pleased with this camera, with one exception: Pictures/video clips are not sent to your email upon Motion detection (hence the four star rating). It does not send pictures or video to your email upon motion detection, just a text email that it detected motion. I went to the manual and it looks like you have to log into your actual camera (from the settings tab of that camera on your mydlink website). You have to give your email password in order to get pictures and video emailed to you. I AM NOT willing to hand over my email PASSWORD!!! I don't understand why it has to have my email password to send me pic or video clips, when it sends me text emails without having my password.

Johnson", "ReviewID": "R5XMSOSR8QVRG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this a couple days ago to use as a surveillance camera paired with capture software to record the feed. I encountered a few problems, most of which I was able to fix fairly shortly. I couldn't get it to connect to my WiFi right away, took quite a bit of troubleshooting but was finally able to connect it via the website after completely registering the camera. I found that enabling the extender mode made the camera drop connection so I had to un-check that; fortunately the camera connected fine from outside my front door without needing the extender mode. Another big problem I encountered was the sound - for the first day or so the only sound feed it gave was a horrendous, loud buzzing noise and I had to mute the sound every time I loaded the live video feed. This seems to have magically resolved itself somehow as I just now reloaded the live feed and the sound is almost perfect (and of course as I sat here typing this review, that mechanical buzzing gradually returned). Additionally, the camera HAS to be mounted upright for the tilt and pan to work properly. If you mount it at an angle (say, from the side of your house) the pan feature no longer goes side to side against the horizon, but side to side against the ground underneath it. This can somewhat be fixed with the extendable arm mount it comes with, though the arm doesn't extend enough to keep the camera completely upright; it still sits at a bit of an angle. The main issue I have with this camera is the fact that I bought it to use as a surveillance camera while I'm away from my house, but it won't do the job I bought it for as the picture inevitably freezes approximately an hour into the feed. I can't access the feed site at my job as the computers there block the necessary plug-in to view the feed, and I'm not permitted to have my cell phone at my job; though while it would be nice to monitor the feed from work, I still need to be able to record it for personal reasons. I've tried various tricks to keep the camera running (i.e. changing my computer's screen saver and sleep mode) but nothing has worked so far.As for positives, it has good quality picture in both day and night vision, great quality sound (as long as it's not buzzing constantly), the tilt and pan gets pretty good range as long as it's mounted upright (but not completely 360, it stops at certain points), and it looks nice. I love the live feed online and it would be awesome if I could access and record it at work, but I can't and that makes it a huge problem for me when the picture keeps freezing when left alone for long periods of time. It's a nice camera if you can monitor it constantly and refresh the feed now and then or only need it for short periods of time, but if you're looking for an unmonitored recordable security camera, this won't cut it.", "Date": "September 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Wireless Camera", "Author": "Cessna89811", "ReviewID": "ROJCGFQVAP3H5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this wireless camera.

My first camera, which I returned, was an EasyN which was not easy at all. I spent 2 days futzing with it and in the end it just did not work. I'm pleased that this D-link lived up to all it's claims and could be set up on my Mac. Getting it all to work was a bit difficult, especially the motion detection email alerts (with photos attached) but once all the correct data was input, it works great. The set up wizard now has explanations to help in your data entry for each category however, there is still some trial and error involved. Prepare yourself for the setup by downloading a 'find my IP address' app to get your computer and modem/router numbers. Once these numbers were entered, the camera easily found my wifi network. You will also need your network key (password).If you use the Mail app on your Mac, open it and open it's preferences to see your account. The info for sending email motion detection alerts is there. Hint: your email address is both the sender and receiver.The picture quality (640) of the camera is fine. I'm sure there will be more hd cameras from D-link in the future but this one is ok for now, especially considering the price. The motion detection photos , although a bit fuzzy, have enough detail to identify a face in case a robbery occurs and the camera 'captures' the perpetrator. The night vision works well too and will automatically switch between day and nite mode if set to do so.Lastly, the My D-link app for the iPhone is workable. It only lets you do a few things but they are important: switching between day and IR mode, turning motion detection on and off, taking a photo, and of course, real time live monitoring and pan/tilt... from anywhere, and it's free!The only thing I have not done is record video but considering that the camera does everything else it says it will do, I have no doubt the video recording works too.I highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "D Link 5010l", "Author": "Lorunner", "ReviewID": "R2UHXOVW408KT3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice Camera. picture quality is good.

The setup is very easy and the cloud part works reasonably well, if you can put up with some lag.There is, however, a serious problem - false alarms. Now and then the camera gets some interference that messes up the picture (stripes all over the image, part of the image missing) which causes the camera to detect motion. Those false triggers amount to tens and tens of emails per day, which quickly gets annoying and can lead you to ignore the real alarms that might happen. A quick Google search reveals this to be a relatively common issue. It is a new product, so hopefully this problem gets fixed in a future firmware release. Then again, it might be a hardware issue.

All lights/ports/abilities are the same except for the single exception. See below...1020L includes a \"wifi extender\" feature that acts as a repeater for your EXISTING wifi network. By the very nature of being a repeater, the bandwidth will be HALF. Half of the bandwidth is consumed by you to the camera, and half of the bandwidth is used to 'repeat' your signal to your existing Access Point / Router. The real payoff is that, depending on placement of the camera, your wifi network will cover more square footage. Also worthy of mention is that you can re-use an existing SSID... making real-world use much more enjoyable. Gone are the days of having multiple SSIDs in a single dwelling, as all the current drop of dlink routers/ap's include this ability. This was not true with the previous generation (see dlink dap-1522, as an example). Of course, you also have the option of creating a new SSID, if you so choose.Feel free to ask questions as comments to this review.", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy to Setup and Use, App Works Great", "Author": "M Masaki \"MM\"", "ReviewID": "R1HBMDXPGL3DC9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a LiveLine IP Camera that is almost just like this one, except that it has remote storage and recall capabilities thru LiveLine's website server and apps. So setting up this one was very similar to the LiveLine but actually much easier and that was a surprise. The build quality of the housing, the motor and the lens all seem to be of very good make. It feels robust and hopefully it will perform as well for it will be required to be on 24/7 for as long as it will. Hopefully that will be for at least 5 yrs plus. Usually something in a complicated camera like this one will fail before then. The older cameras that run off RG59 coax w/ 18 ga 12V feed do run for many years but they are much simpler devices. This one is quite complex with hardware and software alike.I download the iPad and iPhone apps and was up and running right away. Pan and tilt movements are a little awkward to control with the app, but that can be solved in future software updates. The liveline camera controls are much smoother with present location points able to be programmed and stored in the app. Currently this is only available in the web browser control window for this D-Link. Also there are many programming options only available from a computer. I'm sure the app will evolve to give more options and control over the camera's setting. They are just not available at this moment.I did run into problems viewing the camera feed on my iMac. Java is disabled by default on the latest versions of the MacOS (10.8.4) I had to enable Java in the system preferences pane and then download the latest Java version and install it. I was still unable to view the camera feed in the window. It came up with a question mark icon in the window again. I'm still working on the fix, but it is the iMac and not the camera causing this so I did not deduct any stars from the camera for this.Overall I am very impressed with the camera and platform and hope it will continue to mature and grow.

Same thing could be said if you went nuts with the D-Links.Each, though, comes out with different twists.  The pan and tilt feature here is nice and the night vision part is less important because it's an indoor camera.  There are times it's useful indoors, but not often with these types of cameras.  They aren't mounted into ceilings so they can't be counted on for true security situations.I like the wi-fi extender capability with this but...wouldn't it be great if there were one app that found the cameras, regardless of who made them, and puts them all in one place?  Surely that will happen.I'd be cautious of buying any camera with the idea of adding on to it later if necessary.  I had that happen with the first round of Logitech devices (wilife).  Technology will have changed.  Many of the Logitech cameras have shorted with power hits (not yet to the D-Link or Belkin).For one camera, or a couple, in children's bedrooms, these are fine.

The online wlak thru was very easy. I have never used one of these cameras before and was a little hesitant as to whether I could pull off getting it to talk to the wireless router, but it went off without a hitch.

I haven;t tried the mobile option yet, and will update my review when I do.Update: I downloaded the free dlink lite app on my ipod touch, wife's iphone 5, and my htc rezound android phone (from amazon store). They both look the same on the separate operating systems. The ipod touch over Wi-Fi works fine. I can see and hear the camera. I can also control it. On my phone though, the app will sign me in and tell me my camera is there, but when I click it to see the camera is crashes out. This occurs for both 4g and Wi-Fi. I haven't tried my ipad yet as the app looks to be a buck vs. the free one for the ipod (or iphone). The free app does work fine on my wife's iPhone 5 and even shows the picture and moves the camera over a 3G connection. Also tried the amazon dlink app on my kindle fire and it also crash out.Update 2: uninstalled the dlink lite app I got from amazon store and got it off the google store. The google app must be more up to date as it does work on my phone now, but only in Wi-Fi mode. In 4G it won't stream the picture. That might be a Verizon issue, tower issue, or something else but 4g test was a no go. It won't crash, just would say it couldn't stream the video.

Your ordinary purchaser is thus left with a device that allows for effective live monitoring of sound and image, and for motion detection alerts that simply note that motion has occurred, without capturing an image to go with it.  That means that unless the cause of the motion is still onscreen by the time you log in to view it, you're not going to see anything.Some Pros and Cons:Pros- Easy setup- Ability to access camera/sound via Browser or Smartphone App- Relatively good video, arguably better sound- Ability to detect motion and send alerts- Ability to take photos remotely- Ability to increase or reduce the speed/scale of the pans and tilts via advanced settings- The night vision capability is for lack of a better phrase, COOL AS ALL GET OUT- The built in wi-fi extender could be a real bonus for those seeking to expand their home wifi rangeCons- The lack of recording capability is a real con.

Bummer.  Later in the day, the panning stopped working (only the tilt worked), and could not get it to pan anymore.  Because of camera placement (on fireplace mantle) that does not get sufficient daylight, the camera goes on night mode 2 hours before sunset on automatic (day/night) mode?!

I liked the overall feature set, and found the annoyances bearable. However using the camera without the cloud (especially if you have real privacy concerns) is a real pain.First of all, the setup with the cloud is very straightforward. If you happen to have a d-link router with the same feature, it's done at the router. If not, you'll have to use a basic installer from mydlink site (the download is not available on the main dlink site, though). After that you'll be able to use the camera from your pc, or a mobile phone.The first thing you'll see a vary blurred image. I do not know why dlink did not have a reasonable default for home room sizes, or even have a infinite focus, but it's fixable. It took me a while to get it correct, though. The small notch around the lens is used for the focus (yes it's manual), and it took some effort (I was afraid of breaking it).After that the image is actually very good. Bundled with the infrared mode there is good enough result in both daylight, and nighttime. The camera can be tilted both manually, and also to \"bookmarked\" positions, and the night mode can also be automated, manual, or on a schedule.

The DCS-5020L finally ended my curiosity.Setting up the camera was a lot easier than I expected.  I plugged it into an ethernet port and my computer quickly found it on the network.  I logged into the camera itself and played around with some settings.  From there, I created a Mydlink cloud account so I could easily log into the camera remotely.  I estimate the set-up took about 20 minutes.  The 5020L comes with screws so you can permanently install it somewhere, but I opted to just set it down in the location where my dogs usually sleep.The fun part of this camera is that I can login from work and see what my dogs are doing during the day.  The software also sends me an email when noise or movement is detected.  I found out what I long suspected - my dogs sleep almost the entire day.  The fun part about this camera is what when my dogs do walk around, I can follow them with the pan/tilt feature.  I can also zoom in to get a clearer idea of what they are doing.The image quality of this camera is an issue for me though.  The camera has a very difficult time picking up the details of my black dog.  She just looks like a black blob.  I can't make out her eyes or nose or anything else.  With my red and white dog, I can see her face clearly.  I know cameras of all types have difficulty with black dogs, but the lack of detail in this case is extreme.My other concern about this camera has to do with privacy.  I unplug the camera when I'm at home.  I couldn't find anything on the Mydlink Cloud site that specifically addresses privacy when it comes to the camera.  Specifically, does anyone at Dlink have the ability to login and see anyone's camera?Overall, I recommend this camera.  It offers a lot of interesting features - such as pan/title and email notifications of motion/noise.  It's also simple to set-up and access remotely.", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice camera, annoying setup", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"eyegor\"", "ReviewID": "RUMT9Y328FJE2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The D-Link Wireless camera has a lot of promise. It claims compatibility with both Windows and Macintosh as well as access via Android and iOS devices with both free and paid apps.The camera was relatively simple to connect to the network with the provided cable and the instructions were reasonably easy to follow even for those without a great deal of expertise.Some devices offer a wireless setup mode where the device acts as an access point and you do the initial setup that way. The D-Link Wireless camera requires a wired connection to a router before you can do any configuration. That's not a horrible pain, but it's still inconvenient. Once the setup is completed and the camera has attached to the wireless network, you're told to disconnect the wired connection. I choose to sign up for the MyDlink \"Cloud\" management, and after creating an account and verifying my email address, I tried to connect with my Chrome browser on my Mac laptop running Mountain Lion. Apparently, the D-Link applet doesn't like the version of Java on Chrome. They suggest removing version 7 and reverting to the old and peril-ridden version 6 (which is NOT going to happen here).Next I tried Safari which just didn't work. The web site suggested downloading the latest 7u25 JRE, but since it was already installed things weren't ever going to be right.Next I tried Firefox and was finally able to connect. Before I could do anything, I was told to update the firmware which is just fine with me, but I had to reconnect the camera with the ethernet cable again. After climbing back up on a chair so I could wire up the camera again, I finally managed to get the firmware connected and was able to see an image.Visually, the camera is pretty good. It's not super high res, but has a good enough image to see what's going on in the area. The directional controls seemed to be a bit laggy, but I was able to steer around the room with no problems with both the browser and the free iPhone app.Infrared mode was pretty good. The camera has an array of 10 infrared LEDs arranged around the lens and they do a pretty good job lighting up a room. The LEDs emit a visible, but dull red light but they're not obnoxious.Overall, the camera is pretty good, and the setup is easy to do except for the issues with Chrome and Safari browsers.I'm not sure if I like a camera that's connected to the 'cloud' seeing and listening to what's going on in my home, so I'll limit it to outdoor views only.", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good For Home Monitoring", "Author": "Chris Damon \"Classic TV & Tech Guy\"", "ReviewID": "RY08EGP48UJJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I always like when manufacturers provide easily recyclable packaging for their products. D-Link does just that with a cardboard box and pulp tray, and just a couple small plastic bags. Thank you D-Link.After unboxing the DCS-5020L Cloud Camera, you can tell it is made of good quality plastic that will hopefully hold up in time. Under the base there is a standard tripod thread allowing for many possible mounting methods. There is also a nice sturdy mounting bracket and screws that virtually allow placement of the camera anywhere that there is a nearby AC outlet. The Quick Install Guide provides easy, detailed mounting instructions.I'm not exactly sure who D-Link's target audience is for the DCS-5020L. It certainly does not seem to be for the security market, however, it is possible to record the video by going to the camera's advanced configuration page and send the video to an FTP server. Why didn't D-Link provide an SD Slot so the average user can record the video? With the MyDlink setup, the user can watch their house being robbed, but only manually take stills from the portal. If they are lucky, the user has set up motion or sound triggering, which will send alert emails with about 6 frames of pictures or 10 seconds of video per trigger. The triggering functions actually work quite well, in fact it is possible to get bombarded with e-mails from the camera after awhile.D-Link never really claims this device to be a security camera. Instead, it is more of a home monitoring/small business solution. Kind of what like Comcast offers on their commercial, only for free. In fact, it does a great job as a home monitor. For mothers it makes a great baby monitor, for working mothers it's a great way to check up on the kids or the babysitter. The Pan and Tilt function of this camera is excellent, providing nearly 360 degree coverage. I like how a \"home\" position can be set, and after panning you can tell it to return back there. There is a focus ring on the outside of the lens, but this camera does not offer an optical zoom, instead it relies on a terrible digital zoom function that horribly pixilates the image. Since the camera's highest resolution is only 640x480 it is the resolution itself is the major drawback of the device, especially if zooming in is required. The night vision is quite good on the DSC-5020L objects and movement in the room are quite visible, even though the night vision is black and white.  There are endless uses for this camera as long as recording the video is not a high priority, but even if it is, the DCS-5020L can be setup if one is savvy enough to set it up with an FTP server.Speaking of setup, unless the user has a D-Link Cloud Router, the Zero Configuration touted on the box does not apply. The alternate method is to download the setup wizard at the URL provided in the manual. First, the camera must be plugged into your router and plugged into AC power of course. Once you start to run the wizard it searches for the camera and with luck it finds it. If you have a UPnP router (most are), make sure that function is enabled. At first the wizard did not detect my camera, it searched and searched but never appeared. After multiple tries it was found. Once the setup wizard finds your cam it asks to create a password, and then asks to choose what type of connection to use. Most people will choose wireless, if your wireless network requires a password, you need to enter that as well. Next, step is to create a \"My D-Link\" account for remote monitoring. D-Link basically provides their server to allow you to watch the video feed on smartphone, tablet, PC or Mac. You will need to download the appropriate app for your device or log into your mydlink.com account to see the video. Watching the video on my iPhone 4s was easy, the video was sharp and the mic was sensitive. In my opinion this is the best way to monitor the DCS-5020L.After installing an Active-X add-in in Internet Explorer I was able to see my video and control the camera's movements on the My D-Link site after logging in. I had less success using Firefox on my PC.  The My D-Link website uses Java, which is cumbersome at best. In Firefox, Java is disabled by default, and requires that you allow it or unblock at least three different times. I'm sure you can add the site to exceptions. I just have not looked into that yet.When the video pops up it is usually in 640 X 480 resolution, the maximum this camera can provide, although sometimes I get what appears to be 320 X 240 for no apparent reason. I find that the video is choppy, with Java freezing every few seconds for about five to ten seconds, dropping the frames that it has missed. I know this by waving my hand in front of the camera while the feed is in the frozen state and not seeing it come into view when the video resumes. For Mac users D-Link makes it hard to setup since OSX stopped using Java in Safari. It will need to be downloaded from Oracle's website and installed. Once I did this and restarted my machine, the site still said I needed Java, after installing Java again and getting the same message, I abandoned Safari altogether and tried MyD-Link from Firefox for Mac. That was successful after clicking on the allow and unblock buttons. I would suggest using Firefox for Mac to access MyDlink.com if you are a Mac user after installing Java. The camera also can be setup manually by accessing the camera directly through its IP address, but requires a little bit of networking knowledge. The downloadable PDF manual is very detailed and can help out a lot with this.There are two tabs for each camera in your MyDlink account, \"Live Video\" and \"Settings\". Settings allows you to customize the host name of the camera (this is how it shows up on the network), enable and change wireless settings, enable the Wireless Extender mode (which supposedly enhances the wireless signal to other wi-fi devices - I am not using this since I have a nearby access point), enable e-mail notifications, setup motion and audio trigger events, and go into the advanced settings. Advanced settings are actually pretty robust. This is where configuration of an FTP server is possible.The Live View tab is the video feed coming from the camera, which is quite sharp. Since this is a fixed range camera, it has a wide angle lens, with the greatest detail the closer the object is. The night mode has good clarity, even if it is black and white, it can see clear across an average sized room in total darkness. The night function can be set to automatically switch based on available light (I guess?), or can be manually turned on and off. There are also controls for brightness, mic mute, and a button to save a still photo.What I don't like on the DCS-5020L is the four step digital zoom feature on this camera. It is useless. The pixelization is just terrible and gets worse with every step up. There is no optical zoom, so the fixed, un-zoomed picture has the best clarity. Another think that irks me about the MyDLink Live View is that it does not allow the video feed to go full screen like you can do to a YouTube or Ustream video. It is stuck inside a box in the middle of the page, unable to be scaled. Maybe further updates may fix this. There is a downloadable D-View Cam software for better viewing and video recording, but I was unable to get it to detect my camera.Despite the fact that this camera lacks an easy recording solution, has low resolution, and a bad digital zoom, I am giving it four stars. For the price it does a good job of what it is supposed to do, and the picture quality is quite good in both day and night vision modes when displayed at 640X480.There is a 58 page manual that can be downloaded from D-Link's site that is quite useful and very detailed for those who want to get more out of the camera than what I have described here, before purchasing the DCS-5020L I would take a glance at it:[...]", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "This gadget has lots of uses", "Author": "PhotoGraphics", "ReviewID": "RLQ3KFRGUEN51", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This little camera is an amazing value for the price.  While many camera-based home security systems are designed to give you information after the fact, this camera will alert your smartphone if there is unusual motion activity or sounds and let you see it live, while panning, tilting and zooming to get the \"best view\" before you snap photos and call authorities.I didn't need an addition to my very adequate home security system but I found a cool use for this camera.  I have cats that are used to occasionally being left on their own for a couple of days and longer if a friend or relative comes over to check their food and water.  I have the camera set up to alert me when the cats move into their feeding area so I can be assured that they are all right.  Then I check the level of food and water so I can call/text the human helper if the food is running low.  The camera will also alert me if there is any unusual noise, like maybe a cat in distress.  Convert that example to anything you might want to monitor, like maybe chickens who may be in harm's way of predators, you get the idea.Look, this isn't a $1000 sophisticated system so it's not fair to be too harsh on a product that costs less than $150.  For what it is, there could be hundreds of unique uses.  The image quality won't rival an expensive video camera, but it is equal to most small home security cameras.  It appears that for the price you don't get auto focus, which may be the reason some folks think the picture quality is soft.  Adjust the ring around the lens and it can produce a decently sharp image.  At night the images are useful to about 20' - 25' but beyond that it would be hard to recognize anything anyway.I have the latest generation D-Link router so setup consisted of plugging the camera in and pushing two buttons ... one on the router and one on the camera and, presto, it was all set up.  Since I already had a MyDlink account (free) it instantly recognized the new camera and I was good to go.It should be remembered that this is a WiFi camera so it must be within range of your existing router.

This review is written from the perspective of a Macintosh-running OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion), Safari browser version 6, and an iPhone5. The D-Link DCS-5020L Pan & Tilt Day/Night Network Cloud Camera will probably prove to be a great camera for its specified use if I can use all of its capabilities, as specified by the D-Link users guide. But buyers will immediately notice from the Quick Install Guide that if they want to use the first configuration option, a D-Link router (an item that varies from $20 to $160 which is not provided with the camera) is required as well as having a mydlink.com account, which allows the user to take advantage of the Zero Configuration option, either via ethernet or wirelessly.The second option is to download the Setup Wizard and follow the steps. Everything went flawlessly including a perfect limited sized camera picture of my room and backyard in bright and low light via the internet but the final steps using mydlink required Java (Runtime Environment and Java web browser), and I terminated the installation when I refused to activate Java in Safari. Oracle's Java application has been specified by Homeland Security and other computer experts, in some instances, as vulnerable to malware. While Dlink promotes use of the most current Java versions, some of us may pass on this option. DLink must come up with a Java-less solution in order for computer users to fully use their site.However, FULL SUCCESS was achieved by downloading the D-Link lite smartphone app which produces a clear, sharp color or B/W picture broadcast by the wireless camera via D-Link's internet site in low and bright light with sound (which needs more finite control of the very sensitive on-board microphone) The camera looks outside in night vision mode into the nighttime yard. It also swivels nearly 180 degrees and tilts up/down to 45 degrees+ via remote smartphone control in incremental steps and can digitally document what is occurring for future use. It also has the capability to be triggered by motion and sound detection. Look for firmware updates available as of the date of this review. Very Definitely Recommended for targeted use.

I love the D-Link cameras because they are pretty easy to setup if you are minimally competent with technology and I find them to be reliable.The feature of this camera that makes it stand out from the other two I have is that it swivels.  That is a cool feature, but I find it pretty laggy in experience.  When you are in the app and request it to change the field of view, it takes a few seconds for it to move.  In general, these cameras lag a few seconds, but I normally don't notice.  With the swivel feature, you do and it makes it less useful.If you have an iPad, I highly recommend the My-Dlink+ app.  It is a lot nicer than the basic one.  The paid app will display multiple cameras(see the images) and does not time out.I think the resoltion on this camera is acceptable.  I can make out people's features and expressions and even see my cat. This camera has a low light mode which can enable automatically or by choice remotely. It turn out surprisingly good images (see images).Another feature not specific to this camera but included here is timed motion detection.Overall this is a good camera which is easy to install and gives acceptable images.

First, let me share the features that I was looking for and why I chose to go with this camera. The cameras I was considering were this one, the DropCam HD and the Foscam FI8910W.Features/Attributes Important to me1. Smooth Video2. Pan and Tilt (I don't care about zoom much)3. Night vision4. Reliability (functions as expected all the time)5. Ability to motion detect and record video when that happens6. 2 way audioLet's look at all of these in detailSmooth Video: A lot of reviews on Amazon and on other sites mention that videos are choppy and I wanted to make sure that the camera I get does not suffer from this problem. I first bought a Foscam from eBay and that exhibited some signs of choppiness after a few hours in the house. One of the reasons I returned it was because of the choppiness. DLink, I must say, has been extremely smooth for the last 3 days. I haven't had to reboot it even once and the video is very smooth. I haven't tried Dropcam, but based on the reviews, it seems Dropcam is good too.Pan and Tilt: I want the ability use this camera in multiple places and would like the ability to Pan and Tilt. My baby monitor has that feature, and we use it all the time. Both Foscam and DLink have the ability, but the Dropcam does not. That was another reason why I eliminated Dropcam from my listNight Vision: DLink's night vision works well, although the camera seems to love the night vision way too much. The picture is still clear in night vision, but I've noticed that even during the day when there is enough light, the night vision turns on. Foscam's night vision took some effort to turn on, but once I was able to turn it on , it worked well. Note however, that based on a few reviews, some Foscam's suffer from the night vision not working problem.Reliability (functions as expected all the time): The DLink has functioned well ever since I got it. Its worked on all browsers on my Mac and PC, iPad, iPhone and also on Windows Phone (using an app called CameraKaze). The Foscam, did not seem like it was a finished product. It looked clunky compared to the DLink. The night vision didn't work, and I had to use magnets, rebooting to get it to work. The motor made more noise than it did on DLink while Panning and Tilting. Based on the reviews on Amazon, Dropcam seems to be quite reliable as well. One thing that I want to mention here is that for almost all wifi cameras, there is one common complaint, and that is that the wifi connection keeps dropping. I didn't notice dropped connections with either Foscam or DLink. Its sometimes good to disregard those complaints because this is the same complaint for all things Wi-Fi (routers, cameras, repeaters etc).Ability to motion detect and record video when that happens: My use cases for my camera include watching my kids at times and at other times use it as a motion detector. The DLink camera does a really good job of recording images/videos and sending notifications whenever an event occurs. I even set it to create a video on an FTP server. I didn't try this feature on the Foscam, but based on the reviews, it works well on the Foscam. And this is the primary reason I didn't get Dropcam. They allow you to motion detect, but if you ever want to go back in time and see what happened, then you are out of luck unless you are paying them some monthly fee. And I just don't find it right when manufacturers don't provide the ability for a user to record video at their end. No matter how good the Dropcam may be (it is the best seller), I couldn't convince myself to buying it because they limit what I can do2 way audio: If I end up returning the DLink, this will be the reason. I like to have 2 way audio and their website mentions that it has two way audio.(Update: As of 7/27/2013, the DLink Site has been updated to correctly reflect that 2-way audio is available only on models with a speaker, so its not misleading anymore) Only after I got it, I realized it did not. I got conflicting responses from people on whether I had a defective unit or this actually did not have that feature. Ultimately, DLink confirmed that the camera does not have 2 way audio. You can get sounds FROM the camera, but you cannot TRANSMIT sounds to the camera. Foscam has this feature and so does Dropcam. I can't comment on how well those features work thoughThere are other features that are important to people but didn't matter that much to me.I can see why Ease of Setup is important for people, but I actually like to spend time with equipment, so I don't mind if it takes time to set stuff up. For those who like easy setup, I can say that the DLink is easier to set up compared the FoscamThe last comment is on the camera Resolution. A lot of people complain on the camera not being HD. In the end, you can go HD (like Dropcam), but then you pay a premium. The Foscam goes for anywhere between 70 and 85. The DLink cost me 100 at BB. Dropcam is 150. So, I am not complaining if I spend less money and don't get HD. I can still see stuff clearlyIn the end, I would say that if 2-way audio is not a feature you want, I would recommend DLink. Their website is misleading about this feature, but I have an email from their support team confirming that this model cannot do 2-way audio.If 2-way audio is important and so is Pan and Tilt, and you don't want to pay monthly fee, then Foscam is worth a try. Based on reviews though, its the toss of a coin with them. You may get a good unit but you may also get a lemonIf you can live without pan and tilt and want 2-way audio don't mind paying for the service, then Dropcam seems to be the best option", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "service", "Author": "M.

This Dlink wireless camera appealed to me because it interfaced through the same android app so I got it.The camera arrived packed well. I took it out of the box and set it up in my foyer focused on my front door, but placed so I could control it and rotate it to see my stairs and other areas. I loved how easy it was too plug in and get online. I also like the audio quality, it is pretty crystal clear and the pan/tilt is silent so you don't hear a loud motor when you rotate the camera.What I didn't like is that the camera has some issues.1. It is blurry, yes I followed the directions in the manual and I was able to get it focus, but it doesn't seem to have an auto focus so if you set it for one view if you pan/tilt the focus isn't locked in. I found for me I had to really not move the camera to get optimal use out of it. Seems silly to not be able to rotate a pan/tilt camera because when I do it goes blurry.2. The auto day/night settings don't seem to work on my camera. It's placed in an area and at night it gets pitch black, the camera doesn't switch from day mode to night mode, likewise in the morning it's pretty bright in the foyer and the camera doesn't switch from night to day mode. I have to manually control this setting.At this time because the focus issue I can't recommend this camera. I also have the Wansview Wireless IP Pan/Tilt/ Night Vision/ Internet Surveillance Camera Built-in Microphone With Phone remote monitoring support and that has all the same features, however it's motor is noisier so you hear it in the audio and it's more of a pain to setup.

In the end there were just a few minor things that didn't work out for me.First, the night vision works GREAT... inside. I had my camera aimed out the window from inside to monitor the exterior where the window is lowest to the ground, this way I could see if anybody was coming up to the window. During the daytime the video was easily viewable and clear as long as the camera was focused, but at night the LUX turned on and reflected off the glass of the window, and that's all you could see; just a series of highly illuminated dots.So, we moved the camera to the main hallway where it could monitor both that window and the front door with the simple left and right motion. This is where I got a little irritated. I thought I had seen somewhere, a YouTube promo video perhaps, that you could set preset locations, so that all I would have to do was click \"Front Door\" and the camera would move, automatically, into position to monitor the front door. No, doesn't have that.Second, there is no way to flip or rotate the image. To get a clear shot of the front door the camera was all the way to the left, in which the image was 90 degrees CCW. To monitor the window the image was 90 degrees CW. The head tilting got old.I also wasn't too keen on going thru D-Link's web site to view the camera. I just didn't like the idea of us walking around our house comfortably and the camera running.In the end I took it down. Besides these cons, the camera was a breeze to setup and still got some great images.

I followed the instructions on the manual and in about 1o minutes, it was set. First, I had to get the camera connected to my home network, and second I had to make \"mydlink.com\" account. The setup was straight forward browser-based, so it was not too difficult to follow. Also, creating \"mydlink.com\" account was quick and easy. This is my first IP camera in my home, and I have been interested in other brands as well. One thing I realized: unless I am tech-savvy, it might not have been as easy to set the camera without the dedicated software. Alternatively, I have been using iCam (on iOS) with a webcam that's connected to my Mac. The problem is that this requires my computer on all the times. IP cameras solve this and save some power. However, I realized not all the IP cams come with their own nice software. There are also 3rd party softwares I can use, but that's an extra expense. Now with this \"mydlink\",  it's simple to use, and it's and free . It works pretty well on my iPhones and iPad (iPad version is not free, I just use iPhone version). I do not need to configure IP address or port forwarding stuff; I just need to login using my email address and enter the password I created. Pan and tilt control is not super responsive, but it works fine on my phone and my laptop. Other features such as night vision, sound/motion detection, and wifi extender are quite nice too. Night vision mode shows clearer and brighter images than the regular baby monitor I have. I also like that I can switch the mode manually if I want (on my phone). With motion detection, I first had trouble figuring out how to set up because I didn't want to install Java on my Mac. But once Java's installed,  motion detection worked nicely. I had two options for the motion detection to work: setting up email client or ftp client. I chose email setup by creating a new Gmail account. Motion detection is my favorite feature from this camera and works like a charm. As soon as motion detected in the area I chose, I got emails immediately frame by frame. The nice thing is that setting the sound/motion detection has much flexibility such as scheduling, number of frames,  and even a length of the video clip to be notified. I wish the iPhone app had push notification with ability to view motion detected images and videos instead emailing, but emailing works flawlessly, nonetheless. Also, I wish I didn't have to install Java on my Mac. I uninstalled Java right after activating the area for motion detection anyway, and the motion detection still works fine.Overall, this IP camera has been working fantastic without any issues almost a month of usage. The wifi reception and range is pretty good along with a extender capability. Although image resolution is not HD quality (HD version is more $$),  it still shows clear and bright images. I do not mind manual focus ring because auto focus on IP cam is not always necessary. Also, remote viewing with the app is just wonderful. I have never lost connection when viewing live streaming on the app with verizon 3G and LTE.My other thought not related to this particular IP cam, but any ip cameras : Some days before I got this IP camera, I stumbled upon a news report about home invasion in Millburn, NJ caught on a nanny cam. The news report with Youtube video showed very a graphic, brutal, and violent attack. It was hard to watch, especially knowing that the female victim's 3 year old daughter was watching the whole thing. Luckily, the daughter did not get hurt and also they had one of the IP camera hidden and recorded the brutal violence by the suspect. Then a couple of weeks later, the suspect was arrested, and I believe that the little nanny cam contributed to the possibility of the arrest. What happened was very sad and upsetting. Having a nanny cam may not prevent the invasion or any other kind of burglary, but the crucial video evidence will be powerful enough to bring the justice., which gives me peace of mind.", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "A low budget, IP, indoor, wireless camera with barely acceptable image quality", "Author": "Reuben Gathright \"rgathright\"", "ReviewID": "R1MX6Y3BV8WC8J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, you must know that this review was written by a person that manages and engineers a private company security network of 10 stations and a total camera count of 105 cameras.  The D-Link DCS-5020L caught my attention because of its wireless transmission and pan tilt capabilities bundled with IP interface.For the experienced computer user, you will have little problem installing this camera on a wired or WIFI network.  Follow the excellent documentation that comes with the box or online to complete this task.  You can control this camera on its local network by simply logging into its webserver.Please note remote control with pan tilt viewing technology has been featured in IP cameras since at least 2003!  Coming from an experienced security technician, you should not purchase this product just because this feature is inside and you believe it is state of the art.The most important factor of a surveillance camera is its optic quality.  When your home or business has a security event, you will want to see every frame of recorded video to help the police capture who invaded your privacy.  The images recorded during the day are difficult to make out facial features after 15ft.  You could mount this camera next to a door way less than 4ft away to ensure you get all the necessary facial features shown to recognize a visitor at your home.The video seen from this camera can be described as 540TVL at best.  As an example, a 720TVL BNC surveillance camera is currently the best rating for traditional wired video cameras.  A further example, other IP cameras on the market today can record your eye color from 50ft away using high quality optics.  You should pick the right camera for the job rather than buying a camera and hoping you can depend on its video in an emergency.At night, the video quality drops even more because the D-Link DCS-5020L must depend on its 10 infrared LEDs to light up its viewing area.  You will have trouble making out facial features after just 10ft at night unless some other light source is nearby.  As a comparison, some outdoor surveillance cameras of this size use over 48 infrared LEDs to illuminate and make night-time prowlers fully visible.Using an aftermarket software program called Luxriot, I record IP video at some of my offices.  The software was used to record video with the D-Link DCS-5020L and I was getting frame rates of 8.5 FPS at 640x480 over WIFI using a D-Link cloud router.  The frame rate jumps up to 9.75 FPS when connected to ethernet.  A frame rate lower than 10FPS will result in just two recorded images of a criminal or robber running by this camera at night.  For this reason, you should consider using this camera for casual personal use rather than trying to monitor an apartment front door or indoor area of an office.ConclusionThe image quality of this particular IP camera was not stunning but it does do the job.  The D-Link DCS-5020L is not weatherproof so it should stay indoors.  The recorded video in Luxriot was not great either.  As a result of these three factors, I was left with the decision of giving this product a 3 star rating.  You have to consider all these factors when purchasing and writing a security camera review and felt that you should at least consider another product before buying this one.  Today, I use this as a training camera at my office and have it mounted on an indoor wall 2ft away from a doorway to ensure the video quality is acceptable for the task.If you need a basic camera for real-time video surveillance from your mobile phone then this product is a decent deal.", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good cam for the price.", "Author": "Bearcat", "ReviewID": "RE2WEIZHXR760", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall for the price this camera is selling for I do think this is a good value.

While it would be nice to have a higher resolution (it's 640x480) I realize this would only increase the cost and for it's price point I think the resolution works just fine.  The pan and tilt is a great feature also and it's pretty essential for looking around when remotely viewing.  Viewing at night posed no problems either.  I do like the option of being able to string together multiple cameras if desired.  It ends up being a solid option for those looking to expand to a few cameras without going to the other more expensive systems that come with six or eight which might be overkill for the average non-business owner.

Krumpe", "ReviewID": "R3O8MY4YKPKN61", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are way too many options available now for IP cameras.  So many manufacturers (Foscam, Belkin, D-Link, Q-See), and so many models  with overlapping features (pan/tilt/zoom, e-mail notification when there is motion detected, night vision, and so on), make it hard to shop for the right camera.I've had a chance to review several cameras lately and, in general, my biggest complaint has been that some are too troublesome to access (typically through a website or a dedicated mobile app).  I must say that the D-Link stands above most of the cameras I've tried (though I still prefer the less expensive Foscam FI8910W.  Here's what I've found with the D-Link:The good:1) Setup was straightforward.  Because I already own the D-Link Wireless AC 1200 Mbps Home Cloud App-Enabled Dual-Band Gigabit Router (DIR-850L), all I had to do was connect the camera to the router using the supplied ethernet cable, and log in to my \"mydlink\" account online.  That took care of all the necessary configuration.  After that, I was able to ditch the ethernet cable in favor of using wifi.2) The iOS \"mydlink\" app works fine.  With the app, I am able to control the pan/tilt/zoom of the camera, take pictures, and adjust settings.  The same app also allows me to configure my D-Link router (D-Link really seems to be pushing the idea of building up a \"family\" of network products that all work seamlessly together).3) The connection to the camera seems very reliable.  Unlike some of the other cameras I've tried (I'm looking at you, Belkin and Q-See), this one consistently connected with the app, without ever needing to be reset.4) The sound and picture quality is decent.  I don't know how the resolution compares to other cameras I've tried, but I have no complaints about this.5) For fans of tinkering: You can log in to the camera directly, giving you a lot more access to \"hidden\" features you won't find on the simple app (Dynamic DNS, image setup, ftp and mail server options, video compression options, and more).  So, if you enjoy fine tuning your hardware, D-Link makes it pretty easy to do.  Just enter your camera's LAN IP address, and log in with your administrator username and password.6) You can use third-party apps to monitor your camera (for example, the LiveCams Pro app for iOS).  This takes a little extra setup (including figuring out how to do some port forwarding with your router).  But, if you want to ditch the D-Link apps and website for using the camera, it's quite possible.  I've tried it and it works.The bad:1) Java!  The mydlink website relies on Java to broadcast the video from your camera.  The problem is, Java can often be a very frustrating way to use the web.  In fact, on my MacBook Air, I consistently get Java errors that prevent me from viewing the camera online (this includes using the Chrome, Firefox, and Safari browsers).  (By contrast, it seems to work fine on my PC, probably due to a different Java version.)  I also believe I can get this fixed with some tinkering (uninstalling one version of Java and then installing an older version).  However, all this could be avoided if D-Link would choose a different way to implement the web-based video broadcasting.  Note that this is NOT a problem with the iOS app.  I also can access the camera from a browser by skipping \"mydlink\" and entering my camera's IP address instead.  However, it should not be this difficult.Since there are so many other options for viewing the camera, I can work around the Mac/Java problem.

This is a monitoring camera. That's all it is. If you have purchased this, you have an effective networked monitoring device. Infrared quality is decent. Color quality is mediocre, and the resolution is SD at best; admittedly, 640x480 is adequate, but when 720p is baseline for even cheap cell phones and pocket cameras these days, you'd sort of expect to be able to do a little better. The slight fisheye optics are a little strange, and I'm not convinced they really bring anything to the table except making it difficult to use the 5020 as a basic webcam. The wifi extender functionality is nice but little more than a sideshow based on the likelihood that they probably built the device with router hardware and the firmware team decided to just go with it. And there's no video out, so even with hacked firmware, Skype is right out. (However, this last is not a big deal, as I imagine it would raise the price unacceptably.) It comes with a wall mount and standard tripod screw, and it's very light, so although it's really obvious (this is not a nannycam), it's easy enough to put out of the way and forget about.D-link's cloud service is what it is. The iOS app works well enough as long as the network you're on isn't bandwidth-throttled, although I find I'm lucky to get more than about 1fps when I'm not on my local network, and often less. The local web interface works pretty well, but the cloud browser interface is Java-dependent; good luck getting it to work if your JRE is even a little out of date. And setup is needlessly complicated; it's set up for Ethernet-only out of the box, and I found it rather frustrating to get it working properly without the setup wizard (it took me nearly a week to get all the kinks ironed out). It's a good thing you only have to go through that once, because it's otherwise totally unacceptable for a consumer device.Overall, I suspect D-Link limited the market for the device a little more than they really needed to (especially regarding the optics), but if all you need is to keep an eye on the house when you're not around, this camera will do exactly what you want.

Easy configuration and simple viewing through a web browser or by an app on my android phone sounded great.  But the final outcome is just not at a 4 or 5 star level.PROS:- Hardware seems solid; camera has required zero reboots once I got it up and running (other brands seem to require physically unplugging the power from the camera and letting it reboot every few weeks).- Very easy setup IF you only plan on using the Dlink account where you can view your camera online or using one of the Dlink apps.  However, if you have other brands of cameras, they will not be compatible with the Dlink accounts, so you may need to manually configure this camera if you want your whole system to work nicely together.- Nice capabilities for motion AND sound detection (and to send automated notifications to you; great little feature for security purposes, to see if a package gets dropped off, or if the kids are skipping school!).- Easy to snap a photo using the free Dlink \"lite\" app.- There are NO extra costs or ongoing monthly fees if you just use the basic Dlink services that are included (web browser from any computer anywhere, or the free Dlink \"lite\" app).- Since the camera is sending the video feed through the Dlink cloud, you are dependent on the speed of the cloud AND of course your data signal on your phone (if using the app).  About a year ago I first tried out a Dlink cloud camera, and the speed and connectivity was just horrible.  However, over the last year Dlink has clearly ironed out the speed issues, so their cloud setup at least works fast now.- Just to make it crystal clear ... for the common person, this camera is super easy to setup; there are clear step-by-step directions and it takes about 5 minutes; I have spent weeks trying to get all of my other cameras to work correctly.CONS:- I paid for the upgraded Dlink app (\"IP Cam Viewer\") for Android, and it just will not work with my camera; it just shows a question mark on the screen for the camera and says \"not identified\".  The free app works fine on the exact same phone.- The free app does not allow you to pan and tilt the camera view, which is a huge failure in my book.  The upgraded app supposedly can do this, but the app just does not work.  Seriously, that alone is a horrible customer exerience to pay for an upgraded app that does not work.- There is a free and fantastic app (not affiliated with Dlink) that does work perfectly with this camera and all of my other ones, and has full capabilities for panning / tilting / recording video / etc.  Due to the shortcomings of the Dlink app and since I have other cameras of other brands, I had to manually configure my router and the camera to work with the non-Dlink setup, which is a pain and eliminates the benefit of having a camera that is easy to setup if you use the pure Dlink apps and setup.- The focus of the camera is hit or miss.  Most of the time it looks great IF there are not significant lighting contrasts), but other times it looks like I am looking through a flooded Scuba mask.- The camera sells for approximately double of what an inexpensive Wansview pan and tilt camera costs, with very similar performance.  Since I wound up having to configure everything manually anyway, I did not see any extra value coming from the Dlink camera, so for my money I would rather have two cameras for the price of one.  If you can live with the other cons and only use the Dlink system of apps and configuration, I would say the ease of setup is worth the extra money for most common users who are new to using these cameras.In summary, Dlink is on the right track with creating a whole system that is very easy for most consumers to setup, and they have made great strides in just the last year with improving their cloud performance.  In another year after firmware updates, tweaking with camera focus, and after they work out some bugs with their apps, this could turn into a 5 star product line.  For absolutely brand new users who have never setup a wireless camera before, I DO recommend the product because I am not aware of anything that is easier to setup that works better.

I was not able to create a mydlink account because I could not get the setup wizard to complete through the steps and therefor could not register an account.

Out of 5 wifi webcams I've tried, all have bad interference noise on the audio when using WiFi.  Not this one.- Compact and well-built compared to other Pan/Tilt webcams in this price range.- Web GUI and setup wizard are fairly polished and work good (except the WPA2 issue I mention).- Impressive low-light performance for this price range.

I tried the web gui as well as the Mac install wizard.  Multiple times.  No go.  The only other device I've ever had this problem with was another cheap pan/tilt camera (by trendnet).  Not sure if this is a coincidence, or if they share some buggy firmware components.  I have some theories about this but no fix.  Perhaps it is because I have a bridged wireless network configuration.  Or, perhaps it is because my WPA2 passphrase could be interpreted as HEX or ASCII.  I did upgrade to the latest firmware (1.0.1).
