{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good overall, very good value, not without a few glitches.", "Author": "Coinhunter \"Gman\"", "ReviewID": "R9FNTYN1Z7X99", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I live in a descent neighborhood next to the only 3 family house in my area of town and it was sold to a drug dealer that rents it to section 8. For 2 years it was a nightmare, the next 3 years it was just 3 nice single mothers with nice kids. Now that it has foreclosed because the drug dealer is in jail, transient squatters seem to be coming and going. Up goes the security cameras and an alarm system and other neighbors with keys to check on things- yes I'm neurotic. I looked at the SWANN system at Best Buy and several other systems that I'm sure you're looking at on line and on Amazon. Although I really wanted a 16 channel 8 camera, I settled on this Night Owl 8 channel 8 camera. That just means you can't add more cameras later on if you want to. You got 8 period. I have a small house so this was fine. 2 inside so when where away (which is rare), I can view the cats and make sure they and the house are okay. I'm handy overall but AWFUL with computers. I got the cameras set up and wired  ( LOTS of wire), but plenty of length at 60 feet per camera. If you aren't thrilled with wires all over the place then this might irritate neat freaks or girlfriends who hate clutter.  Getting the cameras up and attached to the DVR, DVR on, and a $130 best buy TV for the monitor was not too hard. Pretty easy really. Getting the DVR to record and adjusting the picture, setup, and viewing on the screen were amazingly easy even for me. Few problems. 1 camera was dead. I had to fill out a rather lengthy online registration in order to be offered the 24/7 phone help. They told me to fill out another form online and wait for a response for the RMA number approval to return the camera for replacement. That took only a day but an annoying process. The worst part of this is unlike some other companies that send out a replacement right away along with a return box for the broken item, they expect you to return it ( they pay shipping not you , that part is good), and then wait 2 weeks for a replacement after they have received the broken camera. This renders one camera one channel useless until you get the new camera. They also say they want the power supply with the camera. THAT isn't possible because this system has 2 power supplies and each one powers 4 cameras, so you clearly aren't going to render 4 channels dead for 2 weeks or more to return one camera. So now I just cross my fingers and hope the just send me a new camera without hassling me about the power supply. I sent it back today so hopefully It will happen fast. I went out and bought a cheap camera to use for now, and will keep the replacement as a backup assuming I get it. Lastly, customer support was available quickly and they seem to know what their doing and are knowledgeable about the system. HOWEVER< they rush you and I mean RUSH you through the call. Practically hanging up on you because, as one of them told me, they are allowed to solve only 1 question PER call and are allowed limited time to answer the questions. They actually seem nervous about how long they are on the phone which is nerve arching to the customer and the tech helping the customer. 3 calls seem to resolve pretty much all my issues for now but this could have been done in 1 had they not been threatened by their boss to lose both their hands to a hatchet if they take too long. Yes, that was sarcastic. The process of getting the camera system onto my IPHONE 5s was lengthy and complicated but this was accomplished if not somewhat painfully by call 3. Now it works remarkably well. The camera quality is good overall not great. Great perhaps during the day actually , fair to good at night. It's okay, but I can't guarantee that you will be able for instance to make out a license plate number if you had to. SO, to sum up. 1. wires everywhere. 2. descent camera quality. 3. Good and responsive customer support BUT frenzied techies trying desperately to get you off the phone, although knowledgable. 4. $350 on sale at BJ's wholesale club. 5. 1 broken moderately difficult to return camera. 6. Waiting for new camera means not having a camera for a couple of weeks at best. 7. You kind of should buy a cheap monitor ( IE TV) to make sure you can really watch cameras without interrupting TV all the time. 8. Not overly difficult to set up system accept getting this on the IPHONE 5s took 2 calls alone. It is a nice system really at a good price with available phone help from what appears to be American employees. That alone is impressive. With all this said, I think this deserves 4 stars due to the few irritating problems and pretty good camera quality. Yes I would buy it again, I just don't know if another system might be better, but honestly in this price range I doubt it.
