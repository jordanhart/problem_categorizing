The picture isn't bad, but I used coax cable with compression fittings instead of the cheap cables that come pre-made for security cameras - this cuts down on a lot of video noise that is caused by interference. I also went into the OSD menu and set it up for an outside environment and turned on the noise filtering, WDR, and AGC, which were all defaulted to OFF. The only problem I have had is with the vari-focal. It is easy enought to zoom in and out - but focusing is the problem. There is no aperture adjustment and the depth of field is shallow, so, with a lot of playing around you can get an almost sharp focus on a subject, but stuff closer or further away from that subject will get increasingly blurry the farther they are from the focus point. I've had the cameras running for a little over a month now. No other issues.", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great product, great support, great picture", "Author": "nanob3", "ReviewID": "R3GJF9A1ZWL3US", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I received delivery of this camera less than 24 hours after ordering it. I am using it to replace one of my 8 Q-see cameras on a QS408 system. The daytime picture quality is far, far better than my Q-see's. The colors are accurate the zoom and focus features are great. If you buy one don't make the mistake I made by turning the sun visor around. The white surface reflected back in to the camera at night made it hard to see anything. The documentation has no tech support phone number, just an email address which annoyed me. I called Amazon and they couldn't find a phone number either, so I waited. Fortunately GW (Great Wall) Security responded within 36 hours giving me a phone number to call. Once I was in touch with them my problem was quickly resolved. I am now happy I bought this camera and I will buy more when needed. If you need to reach their tech support I'll save you some time, the number is 626-350-0555.", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sunshade needs better screws", "Author": "Gregory St.Helene", "ReviewID": "R2Z1MYR8G0R6AV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Camera has excellent focus and zoom and really produces an almost colorless daylight sharp image at night.

Easy to install.I wish there were better instructions on how to take advantage of the many settings. I played with them for a while but it seems that going back to the default settings worked the best.You have to change the settings right at the camera which you cannot see the results without going back into the house to look at the monitor.

About 3 weeks later replacement cameras arrived long and behold the same cameras with the same markings and same number of missing screws were sent back.
