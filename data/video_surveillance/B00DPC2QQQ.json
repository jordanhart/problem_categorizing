There is nothing bad about it, but it needs to be hooked up to a sort of recording system, which I wish they had said in the description. I bought just this so I am sending it back because I don't want to get a whole separate recording system. It would be nice if they included all the other things you need to buy in order for it to be set up. Also the instructions it comes with is very limited.", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works well for the money...", "Author": "Casey", "ReviewID": "RYXSGG36LFXMM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's hard to argue with the simplicity or the price point for this camera. However, playback formatting is .3gp, which means you have to either convert it or convince others to install VLC or another video playback suite that can process the images.
