I have to say I like its adorable appearance , the white housing looks like noble quality. I mounted this one above my front door in the entry and tied it into the security DVR. The resolution is outstanding. Definately an improvement from the 400TVL I was using before.It is good enough for day N night vision. 30LED IRs quite bright and intense - could be pointed outwards a bit more. The picture is excellent, and even on a moonless night with the porch lights off, the picture is as bright and clear as a sunny day.It's nice to see who is at the door and to watch for those tricky boys played on my yard.Excellent distance viewing but the only other qualm I have is that it can't really be adjusted to get the right angle and adjust optical zoom, if you are setting it up near your eaves.Anyway, Still could just be fine tuning and personal taste. For the price, it is a good camera; does the job for a couple of weeks. Beyond my expected. Hope it can be work for a long time, i will update my review if there is something happened , i recommend it so far.", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy setup and great night vision", "Author": "Sharoline", "ReviewID": "R1ZXTCYKNRW4NH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first LOFTEK Camera.

These are heavy duty outdoor dome cameras.  The actual dome is NOT impact resistant.  After several days in 120 degree temeratures and extreme sun rays these do not withstand impact.  No matter what surveillance system you use these do work well under multiple environment situations.  Heat though is a big problem in the area these went and they tend to burn out faster in extreme heat.  These do operate great though and have an excellent set of features.  The heavy guage housing provides excellent baseball bat protection.  The color and resolution are as expected.  Tested this unit against a similar CCD and resolution that was over 600 dollars and sadly this works better, so bang for the buck I would trust LOFTEK equipment for most surveillance installations.  Remember, no matter how many cameras you have, if someone wants to break it they will, not before being recorded and used in court for prosecution.

If you want to surface mount and run pipe from the hole provided forget it, the cable has a block (which does nothing) on it and it will not fit through the hole and there is no place under the mount to secure your connections. It is also a non-standard size box and you will need to buy an extra large square box to mount it under the camera and make your connections in there. It is not 360 adjustable, if you need to adjust right and then lower right it won't. No instructions included just a spec sheet. My lens came with some scratches on it on the inside, looks like it was done from the LEDs. The picture looks comparable to others.", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is a security Camera Period.", "Author": "Sally J. Goltzman", "ReviewID": "RWYFTHV3AOSTL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Under description, it says able to email snapshots.  You can't.  I thought you might be able to track movement.  You can't.  There is no CD or directions whatsoever.  I went to the company website and did a search for this model \"Venus-7H\" and found nothing.  Over a week ago, I sent customer service an email regarding questions.  The website says they will respond to all emails within 72 hours. Still waiting...The camera itself seems a bit of a mixed bag.  The housing itself seems quite hardy.  The video is good quality.  As mentioned by another review, my plastic lens surrounding the camera was scratched but I should be able to avoid these scratched spots as the camera will be in a fixed position and the plastic can be rotated.  Will the plastic dome discolor like plastic has a tendency to do over time?  Who knows?As for being \"waterproof\":  There appears to be O-rings and seals on the bottom to prevent water from coming in.  On the top where the unit is mounted to a wall or ceiling, it appears vulnerable to water leakage.  The cable is unable to fit through the opening on the side allowing you to mount flush.  This also will cause pinching of the cable coming out of the top when mounted.  With the mount not being flush that also increases the likelihood of leaking from the top as flush mounting is necessary to prevent water from potentially leaking from the top.I will try to keep an eye on it.  If it starts filling up with water or starts forming condensation, I might drill a whole directly through the bottom of the plastic bubble to allow water to escape.  Of course this would mean the camera trying to avoid the hole by looking in another direction.While I have not made adjustments, there appears to be a lever for zoom and a lever for focus accessed by removing the housing.  You can also make manual (only) adjustments by loosening the side screws on the inside bracket.  If you want to make further adjustments, you can remove the side screws, pop loose of the bracket and then loosen the bottom portion of bracket.", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera is just ok.", "Author": "Chip", "ReviewID": "RD3VDA02086RR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Camera was easy to install, looks nice mounted and was easy to adjust.  The VFL was not all that great.  I am using in a back porch situation.  Distance about 15' from camera.  Zoomed out all the way barely covers porch, a small 20.00 bullet camera did a better job covering.
