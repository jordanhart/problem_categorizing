Had enough strap to tie in a knot.After a week I checked the cam which had taken 30 photo. Night time was grainy but still was able to see deer. Day time shots were good quality.Attaching to the tree the second time the plastic latch on the door breaks apart in my hand.Stealhcam customer service gave me the run around saying it was customer abuse and would not let you speak to a supervisor.Nothing worse then BAD Customer service.I liked the film quality just housing is very cheap quality.", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great gift for my son-in-law", "Author": "Cindy", "ReviewID": "ROQQV7WSHNSG9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Gave to him for his birthday before a hunting trip, he has used it once and showed me pictures of deer where he was hunting.

I have 2 old Moultries which take good pictures but battery life is questionable, but it is old technology. I have Wildgame technologies which work alright for inexpensive cameras.  I also recently picked up a primos 46 which I am happy worth so far.Getting back to the stealth cam. Jim Shockey endorsed this brand so I thought that being from the same city I would give it a try.BAD MISTAKE!  This is without a lie the worst trail cam I have ever owned. I manufactured a metal stand that I can mount anywhere. I mounted the this Stealth cam and had some very nice Sask bucks come in. WOW! It looked like there was a fog everywhere but in the middle 1/5 of the pictures and even that was grainy. These bucks looked like ghost from Paranormal Files. I replaced with the primos 46 and it was like night and day. With the Stealth Cam I could not make any background whatsoever. With all other cameras I could see the individual straws in the wheat field.So I called stealth cam from my cell phone and waited for over 10 minutes. Finally got a tech who said that it doesn't illuminate as well as some of our other models. He askedif I had read themanual and replied that I had. He asked if I had changed the intensity? Hell there is nothing in the manual about intensity. He Then said that he would go get one and work me through it. I waited for another 5 minutes on hold and decided to hang up and send an email. That was 4 days ago and have heard nothing. My guess is that they are swamped with upset customers.This overall proves 2 things: Customer service and product is a joke, and money can buy endorsements. For what it will cost to return it I think I will video it meeting a load of 12ga BBB's and post it on YouTube.Edit: Dec. 13, 2012 Still no email or contact response from Stealthcam.Edit Dec 17th: Finally got back to me. Wants me to send it back at may cost. 25.00. Then on return I will need to repay the taxes/brockerage 25.00. So now I'd have 150.00 into something that may still not work. I am done with this company. Without a word of lie the poorest customer service I have ever seen. BUYER BEWARE! Poor product worse service.", "Date": "October 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't Buy", "Author": "john", "ReviewID": "R3SVK2BEHP7V9Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Worst cameras on the market, don't waste money on Stealth cam. I was watching deer in front of it while sitting in my blind that were feeding at my bait pile and it never took one picture!. WTF? No email contact from Stealth cam? Are they living in the 80's? Just junk, I wish I could return mine but I bought it 200 miles away at Dunhams.", "Date": "October 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible product", "Author": "Bombtech", "ReviewID": "RJU80VIF1UHM9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this product from Atwoods.  I read the instructions, it is fairly simple to operate. I set the date and time and programmed it to the desired settings I wanted.  Mounted it on a tree overlooking my deer feeder.  Turned it on and waited for it to do its setup, then tested it to ensure it was taking pictures.  Sure enough there were pictures of me on there.  Up until this time everything seemed great, after 3 days the batteries have gone dead and the camera hadn't even taken any pictures, so it must have been invisible deer that were eating my corn.  I put new batteries in it and the IR lights and the green test light come on in the test/set mode, but no menu, turn it on and it does nothing.I return it to Atwoods and they give me the option of money back or exchange, I figured that surely it was a fluke and gave the product another try.  One day later and one picture later the same thing happened again.  It won't do anything and the IR lights blink off and on.  This thing is absolute junk, keep shopping, there are much better products out there.Fool me once, shame on you.Fool me twice, shame on me.Won't happen again.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Video feature is really cool!", "Author": "Cmagl", "ReviewID": "R2DYNK6ZQIE1P9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first video game cam, really impressed!!I bought three of these and have had no trouble with any of them.Battery life is good.
