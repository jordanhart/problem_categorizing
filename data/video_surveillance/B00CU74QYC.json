Pro's Built well, the quality control good use some work Ordered 4 of these camera's 2 of them had tiny screws floating around in housing. Mounting Acceptable...cable length ok,will go through a standard wall ..all leads ok..NOW to the bad stuff: first thing first when I put power to the first camera excellent picture short lived why ? you ask? default has the ip address 192.168.1.128 use you laptop to talk direct to camera, go through the typical add ons on certain browsers, I used IE9 and IE10 , Also used Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox. BAM picture came up!!! AND ALL the splash screen menu's etc.. Cool Right? well try to make a change on anything select OK then see what Happens?WTF YOU WILL SAY THAT ALOT!!! you will never connect back to the camera again using any browsers I tried all above browsers and different laptops, Dell's have built in switching for network cables, but I also went the route with crossover cables with different laptops...and what really trips my trigger is their is no way to reset to defaults when this happens even cheapy switchs have the tiny black button that will reset..several power fails will not make it go back to orignal IP.. I also used my angry IP SCANNER for hours trying to find what the heck the IP WENT TO!! no AVAIL .. ok maybe a screwed up camera you say,,, No way went to Second new camera, used my DELL LAPTOP regular patch cable used Internet Explorer, typed in address 192.168.1.128 Video comes up LOOKS PRETTY DARN GOOD, moved it around showed customer, now goto menus try to change anything press OK , even simple changes like time, date, don't even get me started on the wifi part which I was intending to use .... WTF cannot connect to this camera again, Now this was the second new camera, and I tried everything to reconnect to this camera.. IF ANYONE OUT THERE HAS A TECH SUPPORT LINE FOR THIS CAMERA THAT WOULD BE NICE... Documentation very very short no numbers for support,, software is basically worthless , this software and instructions I can do with out because i have been doing this stuff for years, but for someone never doing this before you will be in a world of hurt... Like I said would be nice to talk to someone about the issues.. email me carlwilson390@yahoo.com I HAVE TWO MORE NEW CAMERAS THAT I HAVE NOT TOUCHED YET , AFRAID TO I have to look into return policy hopefully someone from amazon will contact me after this review..", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Loose parts - so much for QA!", "Author": "JD \"buy2010\"", "ReviewID": "RSI69GQQPRZJ7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Unpacked the camera to only to find a rattle inside.  Opened it up and found a loose screw.  I guess the QA sticker was just for show.  If you are using a Mac you cannot set it up with Safari.
