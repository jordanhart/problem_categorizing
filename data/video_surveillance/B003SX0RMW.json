They are cheap cameras which work well in daylight. They have good low-light capability too. But forget about the night vision. You can barely see the outline of an object just a few feet from the camera.My main complaint about this camera is the mounting system. You must remove the mounting bracket. The bracket is attached to the camera with 2 very tiny screws. I ordered a 3rd camera because I dropped 2 of these mounting screws, 1 at a time, and couldn't find them. These small mounting screws will fit under my fingernail. The camera should have a different mounting bracket.Bottom line is that this is a nice general purpose daylight indoor camera which is cheap. Just keep a magnet close by when you mount it.

I wanted an inexpensive camera to mount in a cabinet to monitor the electric meter. I just plugged it in this afternoon, and it is not at all what I was expecting. The image is fantastic. The audio is clear and crisp. All through a 100' cable. For $14 I am impressed! The cameras that came with the security system are washed out by comparison. Made for \"night\" vision they have no IR filter so plants and clothing are shown in false color. This little camera has as good or better resolution, rich vibrant color, and a better image in twilight than the others that range in cost from $30 to $60. For a tiny camera, the case is metal and surprisingly heavy and solid feeling. We'll see how it does at night, but since we have low wattage security lighting outside I expect it will be fine for what we need. The only knock is that it's not a weather resistant camera. But at this price and size it should be easy to make a watertight enclosure for it. A two inch PVC pipe should be sufficient in most cases I would think.

I noticed in other reviews that the little black dots are nothing but plugs and had no function (possibly for IR LEDs for another model).  Upon opening the boxes, I noticed that the cameras do have IR LEDs installed.  I checked the model marked on the box and they are the same model as ordered.  So, I guess this is a bonus for me.  Maybe all newer models ship with the IR's.  The camera specs state that the camera is powered by 12VDC, however all the units I received have 9VDC adapters included.  I guess this should be okay, as the cameras most likely regulate this source voltage down to on lower internal working voltage, i.e. 5VDC or the like.  A spec sheet is included.  As others had noted, there is no mounting screw, just a tilting base mounted to the camera with three holes for screws, etc.  I tested one camera directly connected to a monitor and was satisfied with the picture.  The camera can be focused by turning the lens, screwing it in or out.  There is a lens cap that you will need to remove (if it doesn't fall off anyway).  I tested the camera by placing it in a parts storage room and have good results.  The bonus IR LED's might as well be little black do nothing dots.  The IR does work, but the subject need to be pretty darn close.  Don't expect to have night vision here, but as with any CCTV camera you can always add an IR flood light.  There was one reviewer that said he/she had ordered three or four cameras and one was bad out of the box.  I have not tested all four yet but the two I have tested are okay.  I will do an update if I find any issues later.  I gave the camera 4 out of 5 only because the cameras shipped with a power adapter that is not what the specs called for as well as the spec sheets are a little confusing (there are two image device models available - 1/4\" CCD or 1/3\" CMOS, but there is no indication which the camera has). - Rick", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "its ok", "Author": "jmat", "ReviewID": "R38RHMLGIKN9C5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i purchased this reading the reviews written here.

However, a few things did go wrong with the one I got.First the good. The case is very strong, stronger metal than I expected. The lens is a wider lens than I had before, it even comes with a lens cap. I didn't try the audio/microphone so I can't talk about that.Now the bad. It is true that the infrared lights can only illuminate a short distance, but the image will show both the color image from both light and darker areas at the same time, or at least it seemed that way. But my biggest disappointment is that the color of the video image seemed to 'burn out' after about a week. The metal case can be very warm to the touch when in use, and I think that is from the infrared lamps (3 on each side of the lens). That heat seemed to remove the blue channel from the imaging unit, leaving everything looking yellowish brown and unrealistic.The one thing that is good after all this is, I didn't lose a lot of money. Paying less than $20 means that I feel no need to contact the seller about this. This was just for \"playing around\" with, and not for professional use. If I needed something more, I would've invested more money in an Infrared camera.If the video image hadn't degraded in such a short time, I would have rated 5 stars; it is a good camera for the price, but better in a colder environment and as nothing more than an \"informal\" video camera.Update: The cheaper, non-IR camera (not this one) that I use as a security monitor camera is still working fine after being constantly plugged in for months. The lesson I learned was that if I want an IR capable camera, I am better off paying a higher price.

I spent a lot of time comparing specifications of similar cameras and found all the descriptions lacking in the detail I wanted. In the end I decided to take a chance on this one and it worked out good.I specifically wanted a camera that was color, had sound built-in, and had LED lights for viewing the nest under low lighting conditions, and had a good picture. What I learned:1) Picture. The 380 line resolution is as good as an old analog TV. It would be nice to have a higher resolution but this one works okay. I get some diagonal line distortion in the picture that I don't like but can live with it.2) Lights. Some mini cameras have LED lights but this one didn't. It looks like it does but no, just black plastic inserts. And I wanted to find out how much heat LED lights would put out and if they were on all the time but there was no information anywhere. I even found the LYD website but their information was even worse. I think the LYD CM203CA has lights but it wasn't clear if it also sound and color. Other reviewers said their .....208CA had lights but mine didn't.3) Focusing. I wanted more information on focusing but again it was lacking. By twisting the lens right or left this camera can be focused, and it focuses good as close as 2 inches, a good thing.4) Sound. The cable I am using to connect to the TV is 100', and I get a medium grade hum. I haven't experimented with eliminating the hum yet by trying another cable or routing the present on around an electrical outlet. I just turn the sound down as it is not good. When the bluebird eggs hatch I will be able to tell more about the sound.Buying this camera was a low cost experiment (camera + cable = less than $34) and it has worked out okay.

It works pretty well, with a very nice resolution. At first I didn't know how to wire it but eventually I figured it out, almost at the cost of my 5.8Ghz transmitter. The lens that it comes with is not wide angle at all but it screws in and out so I assume it is replaceable. As for mounting, with the metal bracket it is quite easy. I was able to make a pan tilt mount by mounting a servo in the center mounting hole and then a second one on the screw holding the bracket in. At first I tried to mount this into a plane but it is made of a pretty heavy metal so I was afraid my planes wings would fold in. When I tried to take the metal covering off I found a problem. The lens screws into the metal shell, not anywhere underneath so it is very difficult to mount without the casing. That pretty much ended my FPV flying with this camera, however I also have an RC car which I can mount this to and weight isn't really a problem so I was able to mount it quite easily. Note that driving an RC car low to the ground will significantly reduce the range you can achieve for FPV, at least for my 200mW 5.8Ghz system. Saying that, I was able to still get a few hundred feet of range with upgraded antennas, spironets and a helical. One additional feature of this camera is that it has audio, which may not seem like anything for the plane FPV guys, but for an RC car it makes a world of difference. If anybody needs help setting up a similar FPV system do not hesitate to ask me, I try to check my email often and will respond as soon as I can.Overall this is a very heavy duty camera which can take crashes at about 20Mph and still work effectively, it can detect IR, and does OK with lowlight.
