{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good camera but pricey", "Author": "JWink", "ReviewID": "R1P5XL68OPJ6GD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We got our 1 Samsung SNO-6084R outdoor networked security cameras, 3 of the bullet type version of this camera, along with a SNZ-5200 camera connected through POE ports. We are using a workstation connected to it using the Milestone Essential software. There have been no issues connected to my home network and so far has been running perfectly, forwarding the video data streams from the cameras on 24/7.  These cameras have a lot of features and give a good quality picture.  These are high quality cameras, however they are a bit expensive which is the reason for the 4 stars.", "Date": "February 8, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00ENZDYXS"}}
