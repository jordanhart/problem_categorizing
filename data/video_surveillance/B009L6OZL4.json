Howe", "ReviewID": "R1C9C31HO72A8Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I ordered my Zmodo home security system I also bought these cables, I did a side by side comparison of three cameras using three cables (the original zmodo cable, this white cable, and another black I purched from amazon)all cameras were pointed at  the same area and the daytime images compared side by side on the monitor. The 2 black cables appeared identical, the white cable produced better color and better clarity than the other 2. During installation, this white cable and one of the black cables got damaged, I skinned them back and made repairs, the black cable had no shielding just three 24-26 gauge wires, the common was shared between the video signal and the power supply to the camera. The white cable was shielded and I had no reason to break the junction so I do not know if it shared the common, but I suspect it did.  Nightime peformance was not tested side by side, but the camera LED's rely on proper voltage to work correctly, I suspect the small guage wire limits the LED performance and the distance I see on camera at night. If I had to do again, I would invest in better cables with separate power and shielded video cables.", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good cord", "Author": "reeverdawg", "ReviewID": "R37WKFC9ZAU1Y3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this cord and it worked for the first 10 minutes.
