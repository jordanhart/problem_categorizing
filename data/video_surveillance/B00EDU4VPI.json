{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Typical inexpensive CCTV DVR", "Author": "JNB \"v_tach\"", "ReviewID": "R3RVL03UAAN2S1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This DVR works as advertised. One thing I didn't expect is although its 16 channel, only 4 channels can be recorded at D1 making playback (CIF) of the other channels poor for identifying features on individuals. One other disappointment is I couldn't successfully configure third party Blue Iris software to work with this DVR nor could BI's developer. BI compatibility is often desirable with anyone that has previous DVR/IP camera experience. The software included with the DVR is very basic though they advertise it as \"Pro\" version.Configuring this DVR for remote viewing over the Internet is typical of just about any other DVR I've installed. Its simple with a little experience and understanding of DDNS (for those without static a static IP address) and port forwarding but the novice will likely deal with some frustration just like any other DVR or IP camera.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for the price", "Author": "Boris", "ReviewID": "R24KNN0Y8XJJ6H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to upgrade from a 8 channel Zmodo unit.I am using the same cameras i had on my old unit but they look much better. I have only been using it for about a week but so far this thing is great and I am really glad i bought it.It only allows you to record at a high definition for the first 4 channels.I have the software it came with setup on a computer at work that streams all the cameras and records them.  The unit handles the network traffic well, even when I am recording 24/7 on the unit and streaming to a second computer 24/7 and watching it on my phone.", "Date": "February 15, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EDU4VPI"}}
