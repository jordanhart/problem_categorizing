You can format the drive, but must have a VGA monitor to see the required menu. You can not format the HDD from the remote software.Can't find a manual for the actual DVR comes with quick setup only. Cameras say that they support upto 64gb SD card but have no slot. If they get the documentation the system should work ok.", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Quality issue...", "Author": "rnyproduction", "ReviewID": "R1TY92IYQWIQN0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It took me 45 minutes to upgrade my system with this new POE zmodo system.  I didn't need to open any port or foward it to see the video through my cellphone or Ipad.  Scan the barcode with your smartphone your done. The only negative side the zmodo zsight apps is limited to video only.  No capture, record and motion sensor ability with the apps. Limited out no bnc nor hdmi output. otherwise its a really an easy and hi res system to install.A month later one port is not working.  Changed rating from 4 star to 2 start.  Sending unit back for replacement or refund.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "needs documentation", "Author": "EPMiller", "ReviewID": "R128DBJISCKUM9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It would have been nice if the unit came with some documentations beyond a quick setup sheet that only got the cameras operating but not recording.  Then to top it off there was no link to any manual on the website,  When I called to find a manual I got shunted into endless muzak with absolutely no indication of how soon I would get help.  I hung up after 5 minutes and emailed them.  Several days later I got a link to a manual that I hope will work when I get back to the unit.  All the pictures in it are for a different system.  As to the actual unit, the demonstration pictures on the web definitely are not from the system I got. They are of much higher quality than these cameras.  Fortunately this system will still do OK for our requirements if the rest of it works as advertised.", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great unit for the money!", "Author": "Michael Rowland", "ReviewID": "R2CVF6BL3JJ1FQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good price and the programming makes installation very easy. No need to play around with router settings (ports, ddns, etc.) as it is nearly plug and play. Motion detection is through pixellation and not PIR; therefore, one gets a lot of \"false hits\" unless one lowers sensitivity. Overall, impressive unit for the price!", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00D2M6HHS"}}
