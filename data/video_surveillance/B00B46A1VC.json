The setup software is novel -- at one point, you actually hold your tablet in front of the cam so it can scan a QR code for 'easy' setup.  Fantastic idea; shame it doesn't work.The setup process is needlessly cumbersome and bogged down.  The process just gets in it's own way and fails constantly.  I spent a good amount of time with this thing, and the end result was a cam shackled by a convoluted Android app that constantly locked up and failed.  It didn't help matters that the developer has posted over half a dozen iterations of their own app on Google Play, almost to the point of being schizophrenic.  Most of the apps didn't work with this model, but the developer gives no meaningful clues as to which one we should use.**Developer Tip -- release ONE app and figure out how to make it work with ALL your cams.  That's YOUR part in all of this -- to make a pleasant customer experience that actually makes sense. JMHO, for what it's worth.When this camera did work, it didn't work well. Constant signal dropouts.  Constant app glitches. Mediocre video quality.  Hands down, this is just another overpriced piece of junk in a pretty white casing.I'm not sure why manufacturers seem to think that typing an IP address and doing some simple configs is somehow much more difficult than the crap they create; alleging to be fast and easy.  I hate to keep beating this drum, but facts are facts -- get a Foscam.  I can get them up and running 5 minutes out of the box, no exaggeration.  And if you're capable of reading 2 paragraphs of text, and have moderate comprehension skills, then you too can handle a Foscam.  If all that sounds like more than you care to deal with, then I humbly suggest you stick to a basic baby cam, like this Levana Stella PTZ or this Levana Jena.  Just plug them in and they work.If you're stuck on wanting a pseudo \"baby\" cam with IP capability, then take a look at this Foscam FI8909W in White.  Unlike this Q-See, the Foscam actually works, and is EASY to setup.  Then use an app like TeamViewer or Jump Desktop to access the computer running your cams.  Or just use the Foscam app (on G-play) to access the cams.  You can get all that running in far less time than I wasted on this Q-See.  With the key difference being: the Foscam actually works.Bottom Line: this is yet another overpriced crappy IP cam that got tossed into the bottom of a junk drawer.  Avoid, unless you have excess time and money to burn; in that case, by all means, go ahead and buy this.UPDATE - this Q-See looks an awful lot like this D-Link DCS-932L. Check the pics of the front and back.  Aside from some coloring variations around the lens, these 2 cams are basically identical.IP cams have turned into big business.  Only problem is, every manufacturer is trying to carve out and control their own corner of the market.  None of these new \"easy setup\" IP cams play nice with others.  And virtually all of them are hampered by their own firmware, which is designed to keep the cams completely under the thumb of the developer, which also keeps the customer shackled by these limitations.  Developers are so busy trying to become IP cam kingpins, that they forgot to prioritize the customer experience, which should be first and foremost.  Again, I think I'll just stick to Foscam, which incidentally, is the current IP cam leader all these other guys are trying to dethrone.

I currently use a Foscam 8910 as a baby camera and it's a decent cheap low resolution camera with two way audio.  This Q-see camera is really aimed at the same market but falls way short for a number of reasons.Pros:- Small compact unit (much more compact the Foscam)- Clever use of QR code to manage installation (network ID)- No need for knowledge on how to open ports on your routerCons:- Twice the price of a Foscam- Lower picture quality than the Foscam- Narrower viewing angles of the Foscam- No pan/tilt features- Limited application support, works on iOS and Android only.  Foscam has apps for iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry, etc.- Was never able to get the website to see the camera as connected despite working fine on my iPad.- Constant problems with the app telling me the camera was offline when the status lights showed me otherwise.- The iPad app has ADVERTISEMENTS in it. $160 device and they subsidize the app with ads?

Wierzbicki", "ReviewID": "R2M9BIT7EYDO2J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "NOTE: Be sure to read the update(s) at the bottom of this review>>This is my third web cam I've attempted to hook up to monitor my dogs while I'm not at home. The first, a remote-trainable WiFi camera would never work properly, and I never could get it to work outside the WIFi network due to some complex port forwarding nonsense. The second unit, a hard-wired IP camera (also from Q-See) was DOA because it required a Phd in Computer Engineering to hook up, and I only have a BS Eng.That brings us to this unit. Believe it or not, from the time I unpacked it to the time it was online and I was viewing remote video on my iPhone was FIVE MINUTES! Seriously.Here's what was required. First, plug the camera into the AC outlet. Next plug it into a free LAN port on my router. Then I downloaded the free iPhone app. Registered as a user via the app, then used the app to scan the QR code printed on the back of the camera, named the camera and BAM, it worked! No port forwarding; no trouble registering; nothing. An actual plug-and-play video camera.So are there any downsides? Well, the video is maybe VGA quality (so?). Also, the camera cannot be aimed remotely; there is also about a 6 second delay and the audio isn't the best;.....again, so? It works, which is amazing. Here's something else that's grating: the \"free\" app has ADS! I haven't seen this in a long while, and it is VERY annoying.Yet to be tested: WiFi operation and Micro SD card recording (can function like a security DVR). I'll test these in the coming days and report back here. I've also got to figure out how to monitor the video with a PC/Mac, in other words, without an iPhone.In summary, though, this thing was super easy to get up and running and just plain works!Update: Later the same day...OK, so things aren't quite as great as I thought. Tried to get the camera to work over WiFi, and while the set-up was easy, and led me step by step, after 9 different attempts, the camera has been unable to connect. In addition, I tried to go online to view the camera using a web browser, and again the process seemed seamless, however when it came time to connect, I kept receieing the message \"Cannot connect to the camera!\"....so, I'm downgrading my review to 3 stars based on it only working when hard-wired to my router, and only via iPhone. As always, I'll post updates here as I come up with new information.BTW, this camera appears to be so new that there isn't a lot of support on the Q-See web site.Update #2: The iPhone software is very buggy and crashes often. Most crashes have something to do with the audio function, so I've turned that off. Still haven't been able to get the browser viewer to work, and I've updated all my system software, including the latest Java plug-in. I've tried to access the camera via web browser via Safari and Firefox on a Mac, and via Internet Explorer on a Windows machine. In all cases, I get only as far as \"Loading\" and it goes no further...forEVER. I've had to force quit Safari twice, and in this day and age, this simply should not happen.Also, three more attempts at connecting via WiFi this morning were unsuccessful.More to come...", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simple setup, good quality video, but if Q-See goes away, this is trash", "Author": "Brian Morris", "ReviewID": "RNY0CJRVD9B00", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "On the box, it says that Q-SEE specializes in simplicity, quality and technology. Let's find out!In the box:- camera- CAT5 cable - 5ft- mounting screws and anchors- AC adapter w/10 feet cord (barrel on one end and USB on the other, which plugs into the 2A transformer)- user manual that is unusually helpful - color photos and instructions written by an interesting person- tiny reset button pusher!I plugged in the power and the network cable. I was expecting some complicated setup next, but it says to install the app next. Searching for \"eView\" and installing on my iPhone and Google Nexus 7 Android tablet in their respective app stores was easy. I registered on the iPhone, then chose to Add a camera. At this point you can type in the camera ID number or just use the phone/tablet's camera to scan the QR code on the back of the camera (nice touch). Next you choose your camera's name. At this point, the screen doesn't match the instruction manual -- I can choose Cable connection, wifi already configured or wifi QR code scan. I don't really understand what it's asking. I chose Cable connection since I have the camera plugged into the network. After I chose that, it matches the manual again and I clicked \"Submit\" since the camera showed as being online.On the iPhone, the app is easy to view the video live and the quality is good (640x480, which is standard for these IP cameras) and the frame rate is very good. Turning on audio and talking from the phone into the camera's speaker worked well. There is an advertisement in the app.I then wanted to change the camera to use wifi. The manual doesn't quite match, but there is an online configuration option under the Wifi heading which uses the camera to display a list of available networks nearby. I chose my network, entered the password and it prompted me to unplug the network cable. It look about a full minute for it to recognize that the cable was unplugged and it then tried to connect via wireless.On the Google Nexus 7, when I try to view the video, it crashes and pops this message, \"Unfortunately QseeEview has stopped.\" So, no further Android testing for now...Then I tried to go to the eView website to see how I could view the camera from a computer. I tried to go to the website listed in the manual, but it wouldn't work. After some digging I figured out that Q-See has made the silly mistake of REQUIRING the www. in front of the address. Omit WWW. and you can't go! Hopefully they'll fix that and I'll delete this. Once I did get there, I logged in and it required my to install Java to view the camera. NO THANKS! That is too dangerous and annoying. Fail here.Once I get myself a microSD card, I'll test that feature, which is to continuously record and automatically overwrite.I have some more real-life testing over the next few weeks to do, but my first impression is that this is a decent camera is in the crowded field of IP cameras. This is in the simple category and I am impressed with how easy it was to setup. The quality of the video is similar to others in that category. This does have the cool feature of recording on a microSD card, which I haven't seen on others. Keep in mind that with the simplicity comes a lack of control and a dependence on Q-See and their company staying in business and updating their apps as new phones/tablets and new OSes are released. If this makes you uncomfortable, the popular Foscam models add other great features (like tilt/swivel) for much less money (but much more complexity).", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Q-See QN6401X - Poor quality camera w/glitches", "Author": "Touch Remedy \"TouchRemedy\"", "ReviewID": "RDVZQUTLEHRB8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "OverviewThis web cam is intended to be run without the need for a computer, although you technically need either a computer, or a smart phone for initial setup, and access to a wired network jack. You can use this camera as a monitoring, or security device and it works in day or night time conditions. The software has motion sensing capability and notification. It's not weather proof so don't install it outside. The base of the camera is wall mountable and the camera can be positioned in any direction. There is also a built in microphone and speaker for two way conversation capability from the camera.Setup and Installation* The camera is powered by the included power to USB cable and USB to AC plug.* An Ethernet cable is included and needed for initial installation, although wifi can be used there after if you can get it to work. In my case the built in wifi would not connect to my Linksys 4200v2 router, but would work with a hotspot feature on my smart phone.I used the device on both my iPhone and my PC.To downlod the smart phone app search for \"eview\" in their respective app stores.If you will be using a computer to setup the camera, you need java (java. com), then login to www.Q-SeeEView.com to register an account. Make sure you say yet to the security prompts that come up for java or it won't work.Once I registered an account in the iPhone app I added my camera to the app by scanning in the bar code on the back of the web cam using my iPhone. Alternatively you can enter the serial.You can have multiple cameras added to your account.Camera Quality & General UsageVisual:The video quality is OK at best. It's only standard 480 VGA, doesn't have wide screen & doesn't have any focusing ability so nothing can ever get very sharp.At least the camera can auto selects between normal & night vision (b&w; look) and that works well.Mic:It can turned on/off within the app so you can hear. You also have a mic button so you can speak to the person on the other end, though the speaker volume is not very loud & wouldn't be be heard in a noisy environment.Storage/Playback:If you buy/install a micro SD card, you can play back video from any specific time. The camera is supposed to work with up to a 32GB micro SD card. I installed a 4GB card into the camera but could not get the camera to record or get it's reply function to work.Pros and ConsPros:* Descent design, nice mount for easy positioning.* Does not require any port forward or configuring of your home router to work.* Good Night Vision* Motion Detection* Microphone so you can see and hear the video.Cons* Randomly goes off line on it's own* Wifi does not work reliably* Image quality is subpar* Recording playback did not workFinal ThoughtsGiven it's problems, glitches, the price & that there are better HD alternatives available from other company's that will work/setup more reliably than this camera I can not recommend this.", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cloud Camera", "Author": "Schwartz", "ReviewID": "R1RZZOWNTHJ1QP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'll get it out of the way, I don't like this camera. Everything about it is geared toward running it through their mobile app and web portal. You don't get direct access to the camera from what I see. I don't like relying on their web portal to run a camera. I don't like that I don't know if they are possibly watching my video and listening to my audio or not. The mobile app has ads! That is reason enough to not get this camera. I will give them the fact that setup was pretty easy though.The camera seemed to drop the Wi-Fi connection now and then for some reason. The camera was in a room with line of sight to my router, my router is stable and my other devices don't have this problem, this is not acceptable. The audio wasn't bad and the 2-way audio actually worked really well for me. The video is what you would expect from a cheap SD camera.I would look somewhere else where you have full control of the camera first.

But this product does not compare to the competition. The QN6401X comes with clear instructions, which I consider a plus. It requires a physical, hard-wired connection to set up, which I consider a negative. Not everyone can access the physical network ports on their router or switch. Set-up is pretty easy, another plus. You can scan a QR code or type in a lengthy chain of numbers. Either way, set-up is swift and easy, a plus. A download of an app for Android or iOS device is required. No big deal. Set-up for WiFi is painless, another plus. The Android app is reasonably straightforward. In portrait mode, the Android app has advertisements! Loser! No ads, however, in landscape mode. Once registered, you can also access your camera via the web. Image quality is pretty good. Frame rate is low, which is acceptable in this kind of device, with lots of blocky artifacts on moving objects. Infrared operation is good. There are no pan or zoom functions. You can add a MicroSD card to record video, share your camera with others, capture single frames, set alerts and motion detection with email alerting.All in all, the QN6410X is an adequate performer, but you can get a Foscam FI8910W for half the price and it has pan and zoom functions and will work with a wide range of camera control software.Jerry", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a security camera, but just a monitor", "Author": "Sudarshan Karkada", "ReviewID": "R2YBQG7U3XOKLP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am somewhat disappointed with this product; I had hight hopes for it. Turns out it is just a fancy looking simple baby monitor type camera. But it works and I can't say the same about all the other IP cameras in the market. I have wasted hours on some of the other cameras to work.Pros:- Very easy to install. No need to learn computer networking, no need to change anything on the router settings, and no complex setup process is involved.- Picture quality is acceptable, but not great. Twilight pictures were fine.- Product is compact, attractive, and seems durable.- Their customer support is responsive, I got answers to my questions in less than 24h.Here are the things that disappointed me:- One fixed picture resolution and that is on the lower side. I can clearly see the jagged (pixelated) edges.- The field of view is very narrow (65 degrees?); probably good enough for baby monitoring- If you want to review any past recording, you must insert a microSD card. Nothing is stored in the cloud or their Web server.- Minimal configurable functionality. Basically, we can not change anything.- Any and all recordings happen only on the inserted microSD card. Without microSD card, nothing is recorded for later viewing. However, we can view live feed without the card.- Can not be used as home security monitoring camera (see explanation below.)- Motion (and audio) sensing is available, but it doesn't upload (or email) images or video. They just go to microSD card, if provided.I was hoping to use this camera as a security camera, but it cannot be used for that purpose. If a burgler breaks in, (s)he can take the camera along, and you will be left with no evidence. Cameras made by Foscam (while much ceaper) can send an email (with photos attached) to your email when motion is detected. That is good because by the time the burgler gets to the camera, pictures are already uploaded!Product description on Amazon reads \"Save Email Alert Images for Up to 30 Days.\" I have no idea what it means.

Bottom line, the other reviewers are right -this thing is NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME.  It's full of bugs after a very easy set up process.  Instead I recommend the Foscam Foscam FI8910W Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with Two-Way Audio and Night Vision (White) which is a great product, half the price, provides pan capability, and works with a variety of apps.Pro's:- Smaller than Foscam- Extremely easy set up - easier than the Foscam- Good picture when it works- Easy set up on iPhone app.  Ability to register new camera and new account on app.  Don't need a computer at all.Con's:- Wifi works intermittently.  App keeps \"losing\" camera with \"please wait wheel\" spinning.- App has ADS.  Seriously?!?

It had decent video quality (better than I expected), the two-way voice communication was nice, and I saw a lot of potential in the ability to record video to a Micro SD card.But my enthusiasm quickly disappeared when I found that every app I used to access the camera was problematic.  Q-See basically allows you to access their camera only through their own apps.  Here's a small sampling of the problems I've had:1) Their iOS app would frequently lose connection with the camera.  Also, despite being able to record and then e-mail videos, every time I tried it, I ended up with an e-mail that contained no video.  The app also supposedly allows me to store my recorded videos to my iPhone photos.  No such luck.  No video ever shows up among my collection.2) Their Android app (tested on a Google Nexus 7) crashed every single time I tried to run it.3) Their web app (which first required me to update my Java environment) was a little smoother, but it would occasionally lose connection with the camera.And...get this: the iOS and Android apps include annoying advertisements.  Really?  Customers pay for the camera, and then your free app includes ads?This is a pretty pricey camera compared to many other competing IP cameras.  I still maintain that one of the best IP cameras out there for the price seems to be the Foscam FI8910W Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with Two-Way Audio and Night Vision (White).  It's about half the price, includes pan/tilt/zoom functionality, and works with numerous third-party apps.  There are some pretty great third-party apps out there for interacting with IP cameras.  Q-See's choice to use their own proprietary app means you are at the mercy of their bad software.I am hoping that Q-See makes some changes soon to their apps.  If they do, and if the problems are resolved, I will update this review.

What it does do is so incredible and I feel much safer with it installed so it earned 5 stars in my rating.This camera will not give you a perfect picture to identify the intruder BUT it will inform you (through push technology) that an intruder is in \"your space\" in real time regardless of where you are in the world.  Now that is incredible and I believe it increases safety and peace of mind.I plugged the camera into a internet source such as a router.  It comes with the cable to plug into the router cable box.  Some comment that it is also wireless but I have not tried that yet.It was fairly easy to set up.  I used my smart phone to point to the front of the camera and then my smart phone was set up to recognize the Qsee.  I actually have two locations (different addresses) and I can watch both of them from just tapping on the installed app on my smart phone.  However, these cameras send messages to my smart phone if they sense motion at either location.  Now, how fantastic is that?  I think that is incredible.  I can watch and listen live into either of those locations also.  Now that is fantastic.  The audio is actually higher quality than the video.  I have a radio playing at one location and I can understand the words.  The camera is also supposed to let me \"talk\" to that location but I have not tried that feature but I assume it works.  In my estimation, this camera is worth every penny.The pictures and audio from the camera are sent over the internet and there is no monthly fee due to the fact they run a small ad at the bottom of the screen.  These are ads about security systems, movies, Kroger grocery store, etc , etc.  The ads are not intrusive as they are only 1/4 inch tall and I prefer seeing ads than paying $10 to $15 per month for the competitive systems that don't feature ads.I also installed a 32gb micro sd card.  This records everything happening for about 7 days (then it overwrites automatically) but motion detection is uploaded to the cloud and stored there until you delete it.  This is incredible.At my place, I have 18 cameras set up.  They are every make and model although most of them use a DVR type recording utilizing a video capture card. (The 6401x camera, I think, needs NWR to view the sd card, if you are not using a smart phone.)  Prior to this experience with this 6401x,  I installed 2 Qsee cameras about 7 years ago and they are the ones of that are still running now.  This surveillance camera industry is still quite rudimentary if you don't have the money that the big corporations have.  However, what can be done with less than $2,000 do a D-I-Y is a huge contribution to personal security.You can set one of these cameras up in your front office and see and hear that someone has entered.  I use a smart phone to get notified of motion detection in real time. Sometimes the phone says that an error has occurred and I don't get a picture or sound.
