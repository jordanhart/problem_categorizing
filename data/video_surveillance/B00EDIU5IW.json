I looked around the Internet this was the best price going (at the time of writing this the price was $124). With PlayStation 4 games weighing in at near 30GB+ for a lot of games and hard drive the size will eventually be a must upgrade. And if you're interested in upgrading your PlayStation hard drive it's a pretty straightforward process.UPGRADING YOUR PS4 TAKE LESS THAN 30 minutes - You need to download the firmware from Sony*.Step 1: remove the gloss section of your PS4.  It's the part above the Blu-Ray slot.Step 2: Remove the 500gb drive (requires 1 screw to be removed) Unscrew the 4 screws holding the drive in the cage.Step 3: Put the PS4 back together.Step 4: Insert your usb flash drive into the PS4 usb slot.Step 5: Press and hold the power button on the PS4 for 8-10 seconds.Step 6: Choose the bottom selection (I believe it's number 10) Reinstall firmware.Step 7: That's it you are done only about 30 minutes and done.*One thing you need if you're replacing a hard drive on the PlayStation is the latest firmware update from Sony's website and you need a 1 GB plus thumb drive formatted in fat32. And you just set up your thumb drive with a folder called PS4 an inside that folder another one called UPDATE. Then inside the update folder you place the firmware.And that's it super easy to do takes no time in this drive efficiently doubles your storage space and drastically increases your load speed for games.Thanks for reading if you have a questions just ask them.Here are the steps for the PlayStation 31. Unscrew the drive cover2. Pull out the old hard drive3. Remove the drive from the drive bracket and insert your new hard drive.4. Put it back into your PlayStation and put the screw in place.5. Install the operating system from a flash or USB hard drive.Now you will need to get the PlayStation operating system from Sony before you attempt a hard drive replacement but it's pretty simple and straightforward and one of the best selling points of the Sony PlayStation.Thanks readingPS personally I went with a 1TB 72000rpm drive in my PS4.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bought for the PS4.", "Author": "Derek Mize", "ReviewID": "R1P4YRXI43MSEH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am using this for the Playstation 4.

I was able to triple my hard drive capacity for a little over $100, and the new space should allow me to go much longer before deciding which game installs to delete. For people shopping for hard drives for the PS4, keep this in mind: the hard drive is the same company and the same RPM that comes with the PS4, and I'm a doubter when it comes to cost/value of putting a solid state drive or a drive with a faster RPM in my PS4.

It works just like a conventional 5,400 RPM laptop hard disk drive. It gives me up to 1.50 terabytes of available storage capacity. I needed this to replace a Crucial m4 SATA-3 128.00 gigabyte solid state disk. Now, I can store my entire media library with several hundreds of gigabytes of available disk space left over. It's faster than my Toshiba 1 terabyte 5,400 RPM hard disk drive which is only SATA-2 with 8 MB of cache. So far, it seems to be reliable and it's a tremendous advantage to have a GNU/Linux laptop with 1.50 terabytes of storage capacity. I would recommend it to others thinking about upgrading their older notebook PCs who are looking for the highest capacity laptop hard disk drive currently available. You'll need a laptop with at least a single drive bay that can fit the standard 2.5\" 9.5 mm laptop hard disk drive. This won't work with Intel Ultrabooks that require the 7 mm laptop disk drives so do be sure to check your PC specifications. It would work well with almost any desktop operating system. It's not as fast as a 7,200 RPM laptop hard disk drive, but those types of disk drives are being phased out of the market gradually. A 5,400 RPM hard disk drive is a good choice if you want to conserve on your laptop's battery life and this Hitachi Travelstar 5K1500 consumes low energy while in usage. I probably extended my battery life by another 12 minutes.", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Hard Drive for PS4", "Author": "JDG456", "ReviewID": "R2QZZH61SCP2N0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this hard drive for my PS4 because of its size, HGST's reliability, and HGST's 3 year warranty.  The hard drive has exceeded my expectations.  It even seems faster than the hard drive that is in the PS4.  I was actually debating between this one and a Samsung 2tb hard drive (made by Seagate).  What made me decided on purchasing this hard drive vs. the other was the fact that recently published data show that HGST's hard drives are very reliable.  With the current PS4 Operating system installed (as of 1/27/2014 or ps4 operating system 1.52), the hard drive has about 1,315 GB of free space for the user to install games and content.  I would like to add that if you decide to get this hard drive, make sure that you download the correct PS4 file that contains the operating system instead of the update only.  In other words, one file has about 300mb (update), while the correct file has about 800mb (operating system).

I told my brother once that you should always buy the biggest hard drive you can afford for his computer so I gave in and did so.This HGST Travelstar 5K1500 1.5TB 2.5-Inch Mobile 5400 RPM hard drive installed with no issues at all. The PS4 seems to almost be made to accommodate this drive upgrade.  Just make sure you have the 872 GB version of the PS4*******.PUP Update file placed on a USB device that is formated in the Fat 32 file system. The The 312 MB PS4*****.PUP update file does not have the initialization protocols needed to install the update on a drive that has never been used in a PS4 unit.Make things easy on yourself use a USB storage drive with 8 0r so GIGABYTES on it. Your PS4 recognizes the Fat 32 file system. The Fat 32 file system is on most Microsoft Windows computers in the Format Windlows Explorer Menu.  Go to your Windows Explorer highlight your USB storage device.  Right mouse click and select FORMAT from the menu shown. Select Fat32 file system from the options provided.  Format the USB drive as fat 32 file system. Create folders as instructed by PS4 site and place the PS4*****.PUP file in the folder indicated. Install drive in PS4 console swaping out the old hard drive. With this hard drive installed in the PS4 place the USB device containing your FAT32 formated drive and the PS$ file structure awith its PS$******.PUP file in the USB port os your PS4 and turn it on.Make sure your controller is connceted to your PS$ by its wire since your PS4 is pretty much brain dead without an operating system. Press the PS button on your controller when instructed and the menu's will likely guide you through the rest of the process of initializing and setting up your new huge new 1.5 drive. Now do not be surprised when you have 1.3 TB showing on tour system you were not cheated.  Space is taken up by the PS4 operating system and disk management eats up some space too.

(JUST READ THE INFO ON playstation.com; don't just download the first thing that you see DOWNLOAD)...you will need to format the USB FAT32 (if I'm not mistaken), I had downloaded the file onto two USBs, it wouldn't read one then I tried the one I had formatted FAT32 and it worked... (double check on this, it worked for me)....I assume you already did all the necessary back up... (you can use USB or online storage with PS Plus)make sure you turn off completely the PS4 (no stand by) and unplug...just, take off the cover, unscrew one screw, then remove the metal base (or however you call it).. then remove the 4 small screw that is actually holding the HD and replace (don't lose the screw)....replace, put the screw, the cover and turn on!! you will need the USB cable to connect your controller.. insert the USB and it should all work....PS: now you will have a 500GB drive and what can you do with it?? I found a Hard Drive Enclosure, that lets you put your hard drive into a metal case and use as an external (link below)... you will have to know how to format the HD and all that but you can put it to good use.. not sure if you can format it for future use on the Xbox One, because it's a 2.0 USB.. but  at least you have it and you can use it with a computer :)http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E362W9O/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "PS4", "Author": "Doc", "ReviewID": "R1JIUYB61T7OTQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this for my PS4 and it is perfect.

Since that time I have Filled 1.09 TB of data on to the drive. Most of the files are games. this drive worked fine right out of the box. I am Able to play all my Video's and games like FarCry 3,The Witcher 2, Darksouls, Ect .This drive is performing as well as the (Seagate Hybrid HDD 7200RPM 750Gb) that was housing games.

It came well packaged in a box within a box, with good cushioning and support.  The disk itself is in a waterproof plastic package with some silica gel inside for extra protection from moisture.Once I got my old hard drive out from my laptop, it was very simple to slot this in place and secure it with screws.  The hard drive does not come with any caddy of any sort, and my laptop does not require any.  After that it was simply a matter of reimaging it with the factory image, and we were off to the races.I don't know what the format of the laptop is as delivered because I immediately installed it in my laptop and reformatted it as part of the imaging process.  I ran a full disk check on it (including a surface check), and it came back with no bad sectors or other problems.My only concern with the disk is that after the reimaging, the disk got partitioned into 4 partitions, including a 35GB partition that is unallocated.  My previous hard disk had only 3 partitions on it.  I have no idea where this 4th partition came from, and since it is in the middle of the disk (after a hidden partition and the system recovery partition, but before the main C: partition), I can't easily add this space to my main partition.  So, it is basically 35GB of wasted space.  Given its capacity, this is not a big loss, so I am not going to take away any stars for this (and it may not even have had anything to do with the disk to begin with, but more to do with my factory image).The disk, as far as I can tell, has 512-byte sectors, not the new AFD 4K sectors, so I didn't have to do anything special in Windows 7 64-bit for it to work without any problems.  As for transfer speeds, it is only a 5400-rpm disk, so it is not blazing fast, but it is fast enough for my purposes.  Because of the high data density of the disk, and the 3-platter design, which allows for 2 more heads to participate in parallel data reads and writes than a typical 2-platter disk allows, transfer speeds are quite fast (I did a full disk image of the 1.5TB disk at 1.7GB/min, taking a total of about 14.5 hours using Clonezilla).", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Replacement for puny 250GB HDD", "Author": "Paul Lee Entenmann", "ReviewID": "R3OVB2KFP1FY8W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Runs quiet.
