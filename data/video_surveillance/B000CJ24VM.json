The first time, I had no alarm, but the cops caught the guys!  The second time I had the alarm on, but was set too low and they got into my bed-mounted tool box (put a pad lock on it after that).  The third time I was in bed awake watching tv.  As soon as they poped the glass ( I heard it) the alarm sounded and they took off.  This sound sensor did its job!  After this third break in I added the Radar motion detector and had the dash security light changed from red to the much brighter blue.If you are thinking about putting an alarm on your truck / car, I recommend getting the addon sensors!

I just installed at back because thieves tend to break the rear door little triangle glass, instead of the larger door glasses, this works for them in many cases without triggering the full alarm, because shock sensor don't always pick 'shocks' from the back of the car when pressed toward using force on the door.
