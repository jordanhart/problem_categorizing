Getting Dish Network to do it saves you the labor, but not the responsibility of knowing what you want, and you'll still want to supervise pretty closely to help decide how to put your system in.  This is a new program for Dish, a branching out from their TV installs, so they're still working out the kinks.  For examp,e they'll call you to set up an appointment, but the call center operators sometimes work from a script that refers to wiring up a TV - and the post-install surveys also had questions more appropriate to a simple TV install than wiring cameras.The installers were friendly, clean, efficient, and they know how to pull wire.  But they don't know any particulars about camera systems or *your* system, and they don't have *any* parts, adapters, wires, or special tools.  In my case my walls are all finished, including the basement; so passing wire between the main floor and the finished basement where I wanted the video recorder was impossible without some wire exposed - at least we were able to keep it inside the house.  It helps to know where the studs, joists, and concrete floors are in your place before you start.Since they don't have specialized knowledge, it's your responsibility to avoid any rookie mistakes.  Buy a system where all the cables are premade - the installers can't terminate cables.  Plug in every camera and cable and get the system running before the installers show up.  Most cables can only run one way - they have a male and female end for power.  My installers didn't know about that, so they ran half of them backwards and had to rerun them.  Then in my case 3 of the 12 cables run didn't work; since nobody tested them beforehand it was unclear whether it was bad wire or damage during the pulling.  Again they probably won't know to do this, so it's up to you.I was adamant that all cables be hidden and run inside walls and that's actually very difficult if you have remodels, lathe-and-plaster walls, all walls finished, or want to run cables between levels.  I think the installers did the best that could be expected and I only have about 12 inches exposed internally and a few feet externally up under the roof.  Don't expect them to work miracles that only a contractor, electrician, or drywall installer could do.  Expect 2-3 person hours per camera run : for me that meant 2 days with 2 people each day, and I have one more appointment to fix the last 3 bad cables.It's actually a heck of a lot of work and I believe the price is pretty good for what you get.  Again you are paying only for fairly general labor of wire pulling and simple mounting to walls.  Make sure you have all the parts connected and working on your kitchen table before they get started.  The installers tried their best to be polite and clean in the house, but given how much work this is, you should make your own list of clean-up tasks.  My installers were happy to go down that list and wipe marks from walls, vacuum dust from drilling, and pick up trash they left.  I'm not sure if Dish tells them how long to expect; we only had a 1-day appointment at first.  It seemed like they thought they could be done in one day, but even without mistakes I would be very surprised if a 2-person team could finish 16 camera installs in less than 2 days of work.  My installers were conscientious and hardworking the entire time they were onsite, without any worries about quitting at any particular time.One last piece of advice: consider carefully how to power your cameras.  A lot of cheaper systems have a wall wart transformer on each camera, so you have to plug it in, often close by.  The installers are not electricians - they cannot install new outlets if you don't have one.  I highly recommend getting a power distribution box like  Q1C1 CCTV Security 12V DC Power Distribution Box 18 CH 10Amp with pigtails CCTV Security Camera DC Male Power Plug Pigtail Cable (10 Pack) that you can just plug in with one cord, which saves vast amounts of effort and complexity.", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009UXVGE2"}}
