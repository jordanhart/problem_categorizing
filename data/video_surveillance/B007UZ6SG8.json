{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Really useful", "Author": "Ian Abercrombie \"IanAber\"", "ReviewID": "R17N4VQ4CHYDZX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to look down a long pipe. It works perfectly once attached to something you can use to thread it into the pipe with. I taped it to a length of 1/2\" PEX which is stiff enough to push the camera down the pipe with but flexible enough to go round bends. The camera plugged directly into me Macbook and can be viewed in Photo Booth with not drivers or additional software. Works great and at an unbeatable price. Shipping was very fast too!", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beats Home Depot's one meter cabled camera all to heck", "Author": "Matt Szczepkowski", "ReviewID": "R3GBWNMQWJZB6A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great buy considering Home Depot has a one meter length version of this with a camera attached for 99 dollars. That one meter of length won't do you much good when the blockage is twenty feet up the pipe! Think before you waste your money on a short cabled camera you don't even need, this USB camera works great and is fifty feet long!", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "work for me", "Author": "jeff", "ReviewID": "R3TE5QQK95TL8Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "works just as all the other positive reviews stated.

Very well made with sturdy and strong materials. The camera housing is brass. The whole unit is watertight sealed. I purchased this camera to locate an object causing blockages in the main sewer of the house. The camera is easily secured to a drain snake (waterproof tape) and will no doubt save me a small fortune.
