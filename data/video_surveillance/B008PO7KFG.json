{"Reviews": [{"Title": "8 channel zmodo dvr system", "Author": "Joseph Learn", "ReviewID": "R1IPEQ67W0BYKP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "just finished installing 2 days ago and here are my thoughts thus far.The dvr system is great, takes a moment to set it up, but its not hard and is pretty self explanatory.Pro's of the dvr - easy to setup - decent quality - 8 channels so great for adding camera's in the future - has a wide array of options from alarm beeps to even being able to send you an email if something happens to the system such as a camera feed going out or the hard drive < optional does not come with the unit > being full or bad. - hooked up to netwrok quickly with ease - priceCons of the dvr - came with most of the case screws off < not a big deal if you plan on putting in a hard drive right away > - the cables are setup for 4 camera's, including the power cable, so plan on buying extra connections if you want more then 4 camera's. - the  fact that I can't shut off certain feeds < channel 5 - 8 still display on main screen > when no camera is present gets annoying, but not a big deal.Okay now on to the 4 camera's that are includedthey went up pretty easy, and were a breeze to install, the cables are a tad thin. but if it is that big of a deal for you, you can always upgrade. the camera's themselves are okay, nothing special. here is my pro con list for themPros for camera's - small - easy to install - weatherproof < so far > - decent day vision < maybe 7 out of 10, don't expect hd quality out of them, but I can make out faces at 100 feet away. - cables are 60 feet each, had more then enough for my house. a camera on every corner.Cons for camera's - Night vision is maybe 3 out of 10, works okay if other light is present, if you have an outside light or street light near it maybe, otherwise forget it. - they are starter camera's, plan on upgrading them - no audio - no focus - no zoom - mounts are kind of cheapOverall thoughtsIf you just want to watch you home and aren't looking for hd quality, I would highly suggest this system. the DVR alone is worth the money spent, so basically the camera's are freebies.it took me about 3 hours to install everything and run the cables. and I was taking my time and being lazy, so install was a breeze. I set it up for the mobile use, and can easily watch my camera's over my phone. the directions suggest to use KMEye < droid app > for viewing them, but I actually prefer ip cam viewer, so I used that instead. If you do plan on using KMEye, plan on doing so serious port forwarding setup on your pc router, I didn't have to forward a port with ip cam viewer < no clue why, technically, your supposed to forward the port while using any of them.4 out of 5 stars, due to price and quality of the dvr. again, for non professional use, these are great!", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for several things", "Author": "tacmtz", "ReviewID": "R13HTUHYG6GFOD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband has turned his cameras into a Robin cam, a garden cam, a dog cam all in just a couple of hours.

I am slowly upgrading the cameras.The major problem with these cameras is the need to adjust from day to night viewing. I have two cameras sitting out over 120 feet. The Zmodo is virtually unadjustable as to color and hue while the more expensive one needs no adjustment.Another problem is the IR lighting. It shows a very bright spot light in the center where it should show a flood light to cover a wider visable area at night. To be honest, the cameras that show a viable night vision have the same problem of the spot light in the center. The solution would be to aim every other IR bulb a little outward instead of all pointing centrally in the same direction.There is also a problem with the audio on some cameras.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ignore low reviews", "Author": "Fizz", "ReviewID": "R3QPS6CEDHE3VD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bottom line: Ignore low ratings for this product.I had a Hard Drive laying around, plugged it in, formatted it, and up and running. All cameras worked out of the box, no problems.Don't expect extremely high quality because you're paying $120. Cameras are good quality during the day. At night IR can only go about 15 feet but works perfect for entry ways.Very simple to set up in my opinion. Only issues are viewing from a windows pc, you HAVE to use Internet Explorer and mess with your active x controls to view any feeds. Only takes about 10 minutes if you're tech savy though.As far as the Zmodo App for IPhone, I have yet to get it working but don't have a monitor to mess with network settings right now. Will be getting one soon. Works fine plugged into my router and wirelessly viewing on my PC though.Cameras are decent but mounts are flimsy and suck bad! A little time and fussing with them and they will work fine for you but I can see where people can get frustrated with the mounts.In my honest opinion I would recommend this as a low budget surveillance system.

I did end up installing a wireless mouse since system is hidden and out of sight with the mouse i can control all the settings and review stuff as needed.I did have issues one time but just swap it to the other usb port and it was working again. all my settings are on a very sensitive level since i set up the 300gb drive to override with out video ( that's an option you can turn on during install) I do want to run a Ethernet cable to it so i can view them video from the zmodo app but i just been lazy about it.only a few visitor have notice the camera all of there are in dark  corners but you can see the red IR circle at night if you are walking towards them.install was simple only a few bolts and adjusting the camera to general area prior to final tightening is recommended.

Terrific price!", "Author": "Uppenatom", "ReviewID": "R2AYGII6GA2G4B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hard to beat the price.  Of course, you can't have High Definition in this price range, but the cameras produce enough clarity, accuracy of color, and night vision to easily see if your property is secure around the clock.  I purchased the 8 channel DVR with 4 cameras so I wouldn't have to buy a complete new system in the event I want to expand the visual range in the future.  I haven't set up the DVR for remote viewing yet, but there's plenty of articles online to help out.  I don't expect to have much trouble with it as I have been a computer hobbyist since the MSDOS days and enjoy a little challenge once in a while.  When I get around to it, I'll update this review with the results.One thing I would recommend for this system is to replace the small mounting posts that come with the cameras.  I had something a little more robust sitting around the shop from another project and they worked perfectly.  The cameras are small and I believe the included hardware will work, I just like to have an extra margin of safety when I'm attaching equipment that I expect to stay mounted and positioned correctly for extended periods.  Amazon sells a variety of camera mounting gear for very little cash outlay.  If you order them with the system, you wouldn't even have to wait for them.  It's a small price to pay for some peace of mind.  The cameras are threaded for 1/4 x 20 mounting bolts.  I don't believe my worry-wart style should be used to penalize my rating of this equipment so the fifth star stays.  I am really happy with this purchase.  For the hobbyist, home owner, or small shop proprietor, this surveillance system is a good buy.  Don't forget the SATA hard drive if you don't have an extra one you're not using.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Top Choice for a home security system!", "Author": "TheBernards", "ReviewID": "R3SWJ7R4DWJG5X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good quality cameras, availability of smartphone and tablet apps with quick and easy setup to monitor locally or anywhere with an internet connection.
