Lee", "ReviewID": "R2UPAH1IZ8FB85", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I used this camera as an addition to the BB3521 set. The camera quality is pretty clear; I personally have not tried to take a picture with the monitor yet, but I'm assuming it would be low resolution. There is a delay in the P/T function of the camera, as is with most mid range cams. My biggest complaint would be that when you use the digital zoom, its as if the camera has to reset itself. It delays before zooming (X2); more importantly when you zoom in you have no idea where you are. It does not zoom in where you were originally centered, and I find maneuvering in digital zoom mode tiresome. For comparison, we have a 5 yr old Summertime baby monitor set, and when you zoom in it zooms in immediately where you are looking.Pros:- Smooth white blends in with the background of my white wall.- Still viewing of camera is quite clearCons:- Zoom is horrendous- Lags when Pan and Tilting- Power cord is a little shortOverall, still good enough for its use!", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOREX  BB351 AC 1B.PAN/TILT ACCESSORY", "Author": "concerned mom", "ReviewID": "R3BW08WQT1LAM7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "IT IS COMFORTING THAT I DONT HAVE TO GET UP TO CHECK TO ON MY BABY DURING THE NIGHT, AND IT CAN BE ADJUSTED FROM THE MONITOR.", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$129.95", "Features": "Pan Tilt & Zoom Camera with Motion Tracking - pan, tilt, or zoom-in manually using your monitor OR activate Motion Tracking to have the camera automatically follow your child.\nCrystal Clear Night Vision - black-and-white video coverage records your child's every twist and turn overnight.\nTwo-Way Talk... speak directly to your baby through the monitor's built-in microphone.
