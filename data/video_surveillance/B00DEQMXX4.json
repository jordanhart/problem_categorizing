{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Seems to have it all....... and what it doesn't have, I don't need", "Author": "Careful shopper", "ReviewID": "R18AZXB3PLE8IZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Four Amazon stars for \"I like it\" so far...  needs to be used over time to know if it is an actual five star \"I love it\" item.Needs to be in service over some time to prove itself for both hardware and software in my opinion.Not a lot of info for this system here on Amazon product page right now and I can't list all details and info involved but will do my best to cover some features and suggest you visit the Q-See web site to see all.  And having said that, I have to say that even Q-See is not up to speed with info on this latest release yet, a bit tough to find some details right now.  It did come with a CD for manuals and Internet apps but my CD was badly warped and cracked on delivery.Built in \"Start Up Wizard\" will guide you through initial setup on screen so you don't need to be an expert to get started.  Fine tuning might require a bit more research and thought but still nothing horrible to get through once you know how.I've not heard of Q-See company or products before so do not know their track record for products or customer service.  It always pays to read as many customer reviews as you can in order to make an informed decision.First off, this is really everything you need in one big box (56 lbs)to be sure, 3TB HD DVR with 8 HD cameras and 800 ft of RG-59/12v power cable with installed connectors on each 100 ft length supplied.BNC (bayonet style) ends make hookups very easy when reaching around behind the DVR as they do not need to be exactly lined up in order to insert and lock down.  Much easier than regular coaxial cable screw on ends.  just as easy to make the camera to cable BNC connection and it can be done without being able to see it.Push together and turn the thumbscrew half a turn.  Nice...  camera power is easy push in 1/8\" phono plug that can also be attached without seeing what you are doing.If you have ever run cables and connections in and through walls or chases like this system requires, you KNOW how nice it is to not have to see to do the work.  Many times you have the choice of seeing or doing but not both at the same time.I also suggest you tape remote connections while you are there....  just a bit of insurance you will never regret later.Note that camera power is not supplied by the base DVR box but by separate AC adapters that power up to 4 12v cameras.  This set comes with two AC adapters and plugs for all 8 cameras but when you add more you will need power for each additional set of four cameras.Camera picture quality at 1080 res is very good and most all details can be seen in any area of the view.Of course, the more light the better the view, although, night time low light scenes have pretty good resolution as well.  Just more grain/noise in the picture to contend with.Colors are good when they're good, but cameras seem to have different white balance now and then and will register more red or yellow cast in the scene.  When right, color is nice, but again, lighting is everything and can make all the differenceI do have to wonder about the camera operating temperatures I've seen listed...  depending on where in the world you plan to mount your cameras outdoors you might need some \"extreme temperature\" units.  The cameras with this system are rated 14-122F at 95% humidity  I know it gets down to 'zero' here many times and would not want my security system not working at those times if I was depending on it.You can pick one of the camera views and make it full screen in several ways,  but using the included USB mouse just takes a click or two to change your camera view.This system even comes with a full function IR remote control for feature control.  (remote is a bit limited in angle of IR it seems, but works once you aim well)Other options for control would be using buttons and knob on the front of the box and even an on screen virtual keyboard can be popped up when needed.This DVR is actually a computer running Linux OS and gives you the power of a small computer to do just about any type security setting you might need, both in camera views plus settings for alarms, timers, remote connections, motion record settings, still photo capture... etc , etc...  way too many features to cover here and you need to see the Q-See product details on their web site to fully appreciate what is customizable with this system software.Box contains all SATA cables to add more HHD to the case for more capacity if you need it. x 8 (up to 4TB each)Also supplied are RCA plug converters if you need to use VGA rather than full HDMI.  Just like other video units we all have, HDMI is the best way to go if possible.DVR ouput to USB for memory stick transfer and even ESATA ports for high speed external hard drive transfer.The included \"Dome\" cameras did not come with any user manual and the quick start poster supplied for the DVR didn't cover making adjustments to the camera view once unit is mounted to it's position.  I opened the camera case to investigate and documented how to make the x-y view changes in a set of photos uploaded here on Amazon product page.  Also a few other views that might help picture what is involved using this system.I'm using this setup with the included HDMI cable running to a 60\" LED HD TV and the results are spectacular.  Of course this is not a typical size monitor to use and the smaller you go with physical screen size the smaller the picture you will get in mult-camera view.  But... simple to click on a camera view in order to make it full screen for better details.You can even zoom in on live picture (digital zoom) if using the HDMI HD setupNeed to hear and record sound also?  Q-see has microphones available to purchase and this DVR comes with all connectors needed to plug them in for use.Very impressive system, I can really only touch on all the software features in this review, very customizable for your individual needs.I also can't compare this system directly to any others of it's type using first hand experience as this is the only one I've installed but I really don't see how you could ask for more than what this Q-See 16 channel will do.No way to speak for how long the Q-See brand will hold up, but as always, I will return to this review to update with anything new over time, good or bad.Again, please see my uploaded photos for more information you might be able to useBelow seems to be the full list of applicable specs from their newest PDF manual, but since Q-See seems to be behind on current model info released, please know there might be some differences from this list that I can't find;Compression FormatStandard H.264 BaselineVideo In SDI x 16Video Out COMPOSITE 1.0V p-p/75\u03a9, BNC x 1, VGA x 1, HDMI x 1VGA Resolution 1280x1024, 1024x768, 800x600, HDMI, 1080PRecord Resolution1080PDisplay Frame Rate (per camera)1080P at 30FPSRecord Frame Rate (per camera)NTSC: 15FPSPAL: 12FPSAudio Input-8dB~ 22k,RCA X4Audio Output-8dB~92dB, RCA X1Alarm InputNO or NC 16CHAlarm Output 4CHRecord Mode Manual/Sensor/Timer/Motion DetectionMulti-Function MultiplexINTERFACE NetworkInterfaceRJ45 (LAN, Internet)Communication InterfaceRS485USB 2.0 x 2 (One for Backup, One for USB Mouse)eSATACONTROLS PTZ ControlYesRemote ControlYesDisk TypeSATA x 8 (up to 4TB each)DVR Voltage110/230VOptimal Temperature DVR50\u00b0F to 104\u00b0F 10\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C 10% to 90% HumidityPower Use w/o Hard Drive40W", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Image Quality", "Author": "T. Adlam \"professional consumer\"", "ReviewID": "R2QU7HDVS844RU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Firstly, this surveillance system is massive. While I consider myself an avid DIYer, I decided it was best to leave installation to a professional (who also set up two other surveillance systems for me) and he told me that while the installation wasn't horrible, running a few of the wires were tricky because they didn't want to cooperate. That aside, within a few hours, the cameras were mounted and entire house was wired up.Aside re:dome cameras: I initially believed that all the cameras included were external/weatherproof cameras, however, the two included dome cameras specifically said not to get them wet. Since I didn't need all eight cameras I decided to leave the dome cameras aside, so I won't be able to comment on their image quality.Getting the entire system configured and set up was easier than I expected, though it did require a few hours of intense concentration. Even the system updates, which is prompted for automatically, went off with only one or two hiccups. The apps for using my iPhone and Android tablet were both unpolished, but they functioned and that was my main concern.The image quality is excellent, and details pop. Even the night vision is excellent, though noticeably grainier than the daytime view. The various recording options are flexible (motion, timer, continuous, and alarm) and viewing the video is also just as flexible (you can isolate and even zoom in on a single camera).Overall, this system is fantastic if you're looking for more than just average security for your home or small business.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Can't make it work", "Author": "Bigted", "ReviewID": "R3G5SMK3H67MUF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This seems like it will be a really good system (QT718).  I had the first one for about 4 days, and the picture was clear and things were moving along--although, it didn't seem to be recording quite right.  sometimes when you tried to play things back it just said nothing recorded.  Then after 4 days, it stopped working.  Customer service was pretty helpful.  They had me test the hard drive and it was ok, so they sent out a replacement dvr and picked up the defective one.  That only took a few days after my call.I got the second dvr and was just setting it up.  It seemed to be working, but in just a few minutes froze up.  More calls to customer service and they suspected the power supply.  We tried the new one that came with the replacement but to no avail.  They say they may need to get the dvr back for testing.  I will update when problem is resolved.UPDATE:  I received the third DVR and it works fine.  Customer service thinks it might have been faulty power supplies.  Dealing with customer service is fine.  It takes 10 - 30 minutes to get through to them, but once you do they are very helpful.One final thought - this is a digital DVR.  It only works with SDI cameras.  We had some existing cameras and it wouldn't work with them, or the existing wiring we had.

This is my first Q-See system and so far I'm very impressed. This is the least expensive 1080p system that I could find. First, the documentation provided is excellent and written in understandable English. When I called support I was connected to a rep within 10 minutes and he was very professional and knowledgeable. The web-based interface for the DVR is very good. It even prompts to install the plug-ins and codecs so there is no need to go out to the web or find a CD with the software you need. It needs some polishing but provides a lot of functionality. The mobile app needs some improvement too but works fairly well. Most importantly, the image quality from the cameras are top notch and noticeably better than the 600 line or 960H resolution cameras we've installed with other systems. I really wish Amazon would allow it so I could give this a 4.5 star review. It's obvious that they have a lot of competent people working in sales/distribution/marketing and tech support, based on my experience. They sell these systems at all major retailers and as sales and R&D; increase they will definitely continue to improve.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nicest Surveillance system I've used so far", "Author": "JT", "ReviewID": "R3SVSPPF6DTQQV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I already had a DVR surveillance system at home before I began using this Q-See.  The Q-See is way better based upon my experience.  In fairness - my old system was about half of the Q-See $1100+ cost.  But from what I can tell, Q-See appears to have become the market leader in this emerging product category and that is key from a product support standpoint - particularly the software apps.  Just like with Sonos in the wireless sound system space - the key is good app support (including future updates) to make the product as usable as possible.In terms of installation, since I already had wiring setup from my old system it was pretty easy for me to swap out the cameras.  I found the Q-See DVR pretty user friendly to get up and running.  To me the big thing is the nice App for my Android phone - the best surveillance app I've used so far and goes back to my comments about the need for good product support.  It was kind of tricky with my prior system to view the cams on my phone - much easier now and the Q-See viewing resolution is awesome.So overall from me, very nice surveillance system and great App.  5-stars from me - I hope Q-See continues to provide good support for their products into the future.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Picture quality is AMAZING", "Author": "M. Winn", "ReviewID": "R1PFZ8WQD2VBUO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wiring a system like this is difficult.  Before purchasing, I planned for several weeks.  Be sure to locate the DVR in a place not very conspicuous - you wouldn't want the thieves to steal the proof of their break-in!  That location requires power, ethernet cable, and all those siamese RG59 cables.After all the labor was completed for installation, I was very impressed with the camera's wide field-of-view and the1080P HD video.  The details are impressive, and allow way more landscape to be monitored with fewer cameras.  The key learning I had was the excellent motion detection capability of this system.  With more pixels to compare, the motion detection works fabulous!  I decided NOT to record 24x7 continuously, but instead record only motion detection with high sensitivity.  That will allow 10 weeks of recordings on a 2TB hard drive.  This system has an extra HD bay to install another 3TB if folks want more retention time of their recordings.... but 10 weeks should be plenty for me!Setting up internet connection was easy for me, but I'm an electrical engineer and software programmer.  There are many ways you can view the live video and recordings without being anywhere near the DVR.  Using the browser with supplied plug-in gives nearly all the same capability as using mouse/remote on the DVR.... but you can control from anywhere.  Sometimes, the video is NOT streamed in HD to preserve your network bandwidth - but you can control that by clicking on \"Main stream\" to get the full HD.A few of my mobile devices were not \"compatible\" with the Q-See QT android apps (at least according to Google Play).  I downloaded copies of these and side-loaded the apps and they work just fine with my phone and tablet. (Both Google Nexus devices)My confidence in what this system can catch using motion detection continues to improve....  yesterday, one camera caught a small rabbit crossing my driveway at 4am (total darkness) from about 30ft away!Initially, the colors were a bit washed out - but you can control that using the configuration software.", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "I really love thsi system!", "Author": "Stacie L.

The hardest part was getting the DDNS settings to work correctly but once we figured that out, we were up and running.

Playback is seamless.  Accessing from my phone is a real nice feature and overall a real nice system.

The night vision captures everything in detail, though not as sharp as in daylight.  If you ever need to provide police evidence, this will certainly do it.

With default settings, the 2 GB hard drive gives about a week of recording.  Lowering the bitrate gives you more historical data, or setting it to record only on \"events\" can do the same thing.  With the lower bitrate I also dropped the recorded framerate to 15 FPS so there is more data stored per frame (presumably this will give better recorded images at the expense of playback smoothness).  Night vision is quite good, though much brighter in the center than the edges (the IR illuminators act like a spotlight).  The included cables work well.Remote access on an iPad and iPhone work well, though if you don't want to let it through your firewall (and use a VPN like I do) then the iPad and iPhone apps have trouble connecting through the VPN.

It took me awhile to write a review because we didn't set it up until after the holidays. The hardware, when received, was quite impressive, and I must say a tad bit intimidating. My husband set up the system and it took him near a full day (with kids running around and having never done this type of thing before). We had to set this up from scratch. We ended up not using all of the cameras, we have a small home. We used both dome cameras and two bullet cameras. The odd thing is, the dome cameras state on the box to keep them away from water, but Q-Sees website says they are all weather. They've been out in the rain and done fine, so that was a bit misleading.The overall review: we love it! The cameras are surprisingly clear, even at night, and you can pan and zoom. We could have probably gone with a small surveillance system and been just as happy, but this works.My only issue of course is installation. Be prepared to drill holes and spend sometime setting this up if you've never done it before. We almost contracted someone to set this up, and in retrospect I think we should have done that. These are not wireless cameras. You need to position them, then run wires through your attic and walls, and the wires are quite thick.

This one and the Q-See QT4760-8E4-1 Surveillance System (Black/White).  They are at very different price points - this one currently at $2000 and the other currently at $700.  Here, I will try to outline some of the differences between these systems.  Even though they are at such different price points, hopefully this will help people sort out which type of system will be best for them.Some key differences:* To start, the QT718 is a much higher quality system with with HD cameras and full HD capacity.  This make for much more precise image quality.* The QT4760 includes a 16-channel 704x480 DVR with a 1 TB hard drive, while the QT718 includes an 8-channel HD DVR with a 2 TB hard drive* The QT4760 includes 8 high resolution cameras with 100 ft of night vision.  The QT718 has 8 full 1080p HD digital cameras with 50' of night vision* The QT4760 cameras have 4.6mm lenses which have a 50-55 degree field of view, while the QT718 cameras have 3.6mm lenses which have a 60-65 degree field of view* The QT4760 has 50 ft of standard BNC cable, while the QT718 has 100 ft of shielded RG-59 cable* The QT4760 has 3 recording modes: manual, motion detection and timed.  The QT718 includes all of those modes as well as an alarm trigger mode.Both systems have cameras that are weatherproof and seem to be quite sturdy.  They both use Q-See's apps for smartphones, which are convenient and functional as well as core software that is fairly straightforward.I haven't used it yet, but Q-See does claim to have lifetime customer support, which would be very useful for anyone setting up their security system for the first time.In the long run, these two systems are appealing to different consumers.  The $700 QT4760 has a good quality picture and is probably perfectly sufficient for the average home or small business owner that wants a functional security system.  The $2000 QT718 is for someone who is concerned with having extremely high quality images and much more detailed security image records.  It also happens to be one of the cheapest HD systems available.

On the back you have screw terminals for alarm in and alarm for low voltage triggers, RS485 link for Pan/Zoom and Keyboard controls. There are 4 HD SDI BNC camera connectors, 4 RCA audio input for those camera, one RCA local mic in and one audio out. Output video is via CVBS, HDMI, and VGA. There is a LAN port, USB, and the 12V DC power port.On the front panel of the device you have access to a lot of controls, a record button, digits 0-9, transport controls, menu controls, even a search button. There is a IR remote which has all these buttons and more although you can do most from just the front panel. There is another USB port on front and a door that opens to reveal a drive bay filler panel.Included is a USB mouse for navigating the on screen menus but no keyboard.

Locally on TV, Remote via built in web server, and App.Set up instructions are provided on large color foldout 18x24\" posters, so no flipping through a tiny print book or downloading a PDF, just simple step by step in full color.If you have an older BNC/power line wired system you can use this system with your existing wiring. But you can not combine cameras. You must use these digital camera only for this DVR.That being said the quality is a major improvement over the old analog style cameras. No line noise and crisp sharp HD images which can easily be used to identify faces, license plates, etc.The DVR works great, recording dutifully day and night with no maintenance or administration needed. You can set the system up and just forget about it until you need to go back and review video.You can hook up the DVR to a TV with HDMI or a monitor with VGA and get excellent quality output, the picture looks great even on very large screens. Or you can use the lower quality CVBS connection for remote monitors.The only negative I have for this system is the limitation to the 4 proprietary cameras.
