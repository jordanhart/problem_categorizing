I Highly suggest going directly to \"LTS\" for the product and support even if it will cost a few more dollars.  (They are also listed Amazon Sellers).Also suggest not using the program disk with delivered with the product \"Toss it in the trash\", then go to LTS web site and download \"CMS2\" software that works on this DVR.R-Tech gets a low rating for poor support and non response, but the product gets a high 4 for a DVR in this price range.This is a great product for the price, but I suggest spending a few dollars extra and buy it from a Seller, more responsive to Buyer's problems and support needs if possible.", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "love the system hate the remote", "Author": "william gantt", "ReviewID": "R1N86URLQBUA5T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "remote is worthless ,if you want to do even the most simple task you have to use a mouse .hopefully I can get a upgraded remote .", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "works good, just as I expected", "Author": "LauderdaleFlex", "ReviewID": "R1LXHRVM7QAMW1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I\"ve been able to connect up the DVR and use it with the web and my iphone for monitoring away from home.
