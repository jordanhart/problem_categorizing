{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It works, but definitely not ideal", "Author": "H-Bar", "ReviewID": "R1NQWX45XQIM7J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "See update below ** Feb 5 2014 **Purchased a week ago.  Setup was fairly simply.  Viewing live feed on web app works great.  Alarm notifications to Android app appear to be reliable. I can make out sound on the Android app feed.  It's not ideal, but for the price I can live with it. Now the problems.1.  The camera is supposed to (I believe) save a picture to go along with the alarm.  On the web site, and Android app, all I see is a broken link icon where a picture is supposed to be.  Yes, I know there was an alarm triggered, but I have no way of determining what caused it.2.  Connecting my camera to Google account does not work.  Same goes for my Twitter account (for alert notification only).  So I have no way of seeing what the camera saw in the past.3.  The interior daytime picture has a purple hue.  Not sure why.  It's clear and reasonably sharp, but the color is really strange.4.  The interior nighttime picture isn't bad (considering the room is completely dark). When the camera IR lights are on, I am wondering if some of them are burnt out.  Not sure how many there are supposed to be, but they don't completely circle the camera.  There appear to be only 6 lights, but it seems there should be 8.  Hopefully Tech Support can clarify.Based on the above, I give it 3 stars.  If I can get some of these items corrected, I will change my rating appropriately.I plan to call tech support about the problems.  They are only open during the week, and I installed the camera, and wrote this summary, on the weekend.  Check back for an update later this week.** Update Feb 5 2014 to numeric items above1.  See note #2 below.  Once my camera made friends with Google, there is now an icon for both You Tube and Picasa (that I can click on to get a picture/video of what triggered the alarm), as well as the alarm time.2.  This past Monday I received an email out of the blue from You-Tube stating that I have successfully uploaded a video!  It was from my camera.  Apparently an alarm was triggered, and it uploaded a pic and video to Google.  I have NO IDEA why the connection to my Google account started working, but it did.  The last feedback I received from the camera software was that it was unable to connect to my account.  Well, it was a nice but unexpected surprise.3.  This has not changed.  Picture clarity is still good (both daytime and nighttime with IR).  Color is just off.4.  I called the Samsung tech support line about the IR lights.  I only had to wait a few minutes to speak with a fairly knowledgeable person who spoke great english.  I mentioned that there was not a complete ring of IR lights circling the camera eye - just an incomplete or \"C\" shaped circle of 6 red IR lights. I told him I was concerned some were burnt out (to make it a complete or \"O\" shaped circle).  He at first quickly stated the IR lights should make a complete circle, but after checking with (I guess) some of his associates in the room, he came back to say there should be only 6 lights making a \"C\" shaped circle.  I still wonder if he is right.  I'll have to do some searching on the internet to see if I can get independent confirmation.Additional notes:a) The motion detection seems to be either too sensitive, or not sensitive enough.  On the web-based setup screen, there is a slider bar to adjust the sensitivity setting, but it appears there are only a few pre-set marks that you can move the slider to between the farmost left and farmost right positions - it's not infinitely adjustable between the leftmost and rightmost setting.  So if you need completely reliable motion detection, this may not be the item for you.b)  I recently had power outages due to winter weather storms.  Every time the power came back on, the camera quickly reconnected to the Wi-Fi network.c) The Android app is nice, and you can quickly pull up your camera (it can handle multiple cameras), and see AND HEAR what the camera is seeing and hearing.d)  It also has a sound detection alarm setting that I have not used.  I guess it would be good for detecting a window breaking, etc.  I have not used it because I have dogs, and they would be setting the alarm off all day with their barking every time a deer or squirrel walked by.Since the whole Google thing is now working, I'm increasing my rating to 4-stars. It's not AT ALL a perfect camera, but you can't beat the features FOR THE PRICE.", "Date": "February 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Don't want to share, just monitor", "Author": "Lariatbob", "ReviewID": "R3PIPFA9HSLCTE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was surprised to find out that you must register with Samsung, agree to allow access to your images, in order to use the camera.Returned it.", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Product", "Author": "Stevo", "ReviewID": "R2EUJFL75UOTCQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this product to monitor my pets when I'm away.

The \"refurbished\" label that applies to this is irrelevant.  The unit I received was flawless in terms of physical condition (complete with the little plastic sticky protective covers like you'd find on a brand new cell phone) and performance.From what I read, the only reason these units were refurbished was because of a piece of hardware that they determined needed to be upgraded.  I could be wrong, but that's what I remember reading.In terms of setup, I would just advise everyone to FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS.  I know this is difficult for some of us who like to just plug it in and then start \"problem solving\" until it works.  But if you follow the steps in the instructions, I would think it shouldn't take more than ten minutes tops to get it up and running.The only reason I didn't give the product 5 stars is because of the storage capability.  This product does not have an external storage slot for an SD card.  I knew that going in, but I thought I'd be able to use youtube (a paid account with upgraded storage) to store a week or two's worth of video from the business where I use this camera.  I was disappointed to see that only 30 second clips are uploaded to youtube.  So I looked into a 3rd party cloud storage solution.  Samsung has partnered with iWatchlife to offer a cloud storage solution.  Although the price is very reasonable and it does work, I'm not thrilled with the iWatchlife at all.For a petcam, baby monitor, intruder monitor, etc, this camera is awesome and a great value.  If you need to be able to store a video feed for a business or for other reasons, I'd do some research about 3rd party storage solutions and make you can get what you need.", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great, Well-built Camera...Did not work well with my security system", "Author": "Larry Fitt  \"SCC man\"", "ReviewID": "R1KA2023IJ61ON", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera was delivered quickly and well packed.

No. Not at all.  First off if they wanted to enter the whole security space thing why is there no option for storing events on the phone (I have a 32 gig card lots of space) or a PRIVATE account. Instead it only can only be uploaded to youtube or picaso (real lazy work there Samsung). Now I don't have anything embarrassing, its just my room with my ferret so I'm not upset about it being uploaded for everyone to see.  There is one advantage of this, a smart thief that robs a house will also ROB your dvr leaving you with no footage of the said robbery, these videos go straight to youtube servers so they can't get rid of the footage.  Samsung should have started their own servers for these security cameras with more options but they were too lazy to do that. As for the motion detection and audio detection it depends on how you positioned the camera and the sensitivity level, all cameras that I've ever used have this issue, its either too much detection or no detection to little at all. You gotta find the sweet spot.  This device does something though that I have never seen with another device, when the sun is rising or setting, the light is changing you will hear really loud clicks, really really loud as if its slowly turning itself into night vision and will begin recording an event because of this. Did Samsung test this camera at all? Is there no dawn and dusk in Korea, how did that get past testing? How was that not corrected? I've never seen another security camera do that.  After awhile it stops detecting at all, I figured (have an android phone with app killer) that maybe I should let run in the background, stop closing it but no it still won't record, sometimes it would only record if I turned the lights on during THE DAYTIME. I don't even.... Serious light issues. Sometimes it would only work if I walked up to it and tapped the hell out of it, oh now your awake and recording? Is that what the thief will do when he robs me?  I've now got to the sweet spot that I was talking about, kept it turned away from the window, the sensitivity level is right and it does work. Sometimes it doesn't, it can be frustrating but for the most part it does work. I just wish they had made servers where every new video will privately be recorded and erase the oldest video when it gets full, then let you store the important ones.  The set up process is simple but what they forget to tell you is YOU HAVE TO LOG IN ON THE SAMSUNG WEBSITE ON AN ACTUAL COMPUTER TO MAKE IT UPLOAD VIDEOS TO YOUTUBE. For a awhile it wouldn't upload and I had set up the account in the app but you have to go online to the actual website and that was never stated in the directions . (you could probably do that too from a smart phone).  The camera and app do have a lot of cool features and yes you can zoom in, you can put the camera upside down and they have options to flip the video so thats great, the night vision is good too, I'm not recording a massive fort Knox, just my room. The night vision sensors are in a C which looks alarming as if maybe a sensor is out but thats normal, night vision works fine.  I got this at a very cheap price so I'm gonna keep it and there are some advantages but there are a ton of cheaper ip cameras out there with much better recording storage options (that part is huge Samsung, indirect protected youtube servers are a good start but thats amateur stuff come on) and serious light detection issues, falling asleep on the job but \"suddenly\" waking up when I turn the lights on in board daylight Or smack the camera....", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works well", "Author": "Michaela Muranova", "ReviewID": "R15YFXRW2ZRMGT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Works really well but the setup was a nightmare.

I did a lot of research and came across this camera. The camera is 'remanufactured' but it arrived looking like new, in plastic, the Samsung box, and with all pamphlets or brochures. It was really simple to install (only four small screws) and it took me about 2 minutes to program. When I say program I mean: 1) download the app on your phone or go the website on your computer; 2) plug it in the wall; 3) type in one page of information, name your camera, and wait for the light to turn to the designated color (I think it's green). This camera does not turn from side to side, but it does zoom in. The wide angle lens does offer a very vast view of the room your trying to watch. The night vision is awesome. The daytime vision is even better and very clear. There is a motion sensor which you can turn on or off via the app or your computer. I will say that it's a little sensitive. I have a camera in my living room and with my blinds open, if the sun changes directions or a bird's shadow graces the room, it will alert you. Of course, you can shut it off if it becomes an issue. I believe there's a function when you can save a voice recording on it. I think you have to be standing in front of the camera while recording and it is probably just an added deturrent against intruders. The camera DOES NOT alert authorities if a break-in occurs. It ONLY alerts you on your phone or via email. Take note on this part if you purchase one: When the night vision comes on, you will see red lights in the front of the camera. They do not go around the whole lens! They only form a 'C' shape. This is how it is supposed to be, so don't freak out.I purchased the camera to watch my home while I'm gone and keep an eye on my dog while he's locked up. It's kind of nice to have a camera that I can record my voice on, so if he does get into mischief, I can play the recording and typically he'll be at ease.

I have it in my cabin in Ellijay, I can beam in live and look at if you camera detects any motion or audio, I am alerted on my phone. Night vision is not the best because any bright light (like a street light) can mess viewing up. Overall, it's a great little camera and has a microphone and speaker so that's a huge plus.

You can see what is going on in the room/area well and we had no problems with set up - it was very easy. Now we can check in on our dogs at any time during the work day and have the peace of mind of knowing that they are ok, and the house is secure. I do wish that the resolution was a lot better and that you could move them around to see more, but perhaps in a newer model that will be available. In one of the cameras we purchased, we discovered that the power supply was DOA right out of the box. We contacted the company and there is a rather extensive process to exchange it, so we just purchased a new power supply here on Amazon. I really like that you can hear what is going on through the cameras and that they have a feature where you can speak through them, as well. The quality of sound from us via the phone app to the house isn't great, but it is clear enough to understand. In addition, if we forget to leave a light on (we work evening shifts), the night vision is good enough for us to still get an idea of what is going on and count doggy heads.

But FIRST, do NOT install the third party software in the big color pamphlet unless you want to pay for extra services!  Go right to the smaller, duller Samsung instruction sheet for the free service which really is quite inclusive.  Yes, you have to give Samsung your gmail address (which includes youtube or course) and password, but just set up a dummy account for it and you dont have to worry about security.
