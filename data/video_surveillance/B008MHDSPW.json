It's not great but for the money I spent but I would suggest this system to my friends and family..First, I purchased the system with only 4 cameras.. I then forgot to order a few 150' cables but that was my fault.. Once the system was installed I found 4 cameras is good for a general over view of my home but I decided I wanted 4 more to really place them in the perfect spots (like sidewalks) to really catch a persons face..My first system had problems.. I called the tech support and they were super helpful.. They decided my system was bad.. They cross shipped me a new DVR so I'd have to rate Zmodo's customer service as an \"A\".. I'd give it an \"A+\" but it sounded like they had 50 support people in a small room and there was alot of echo when trying to talk to the tech..The second DVR works great.. Easy to use..The cameras are good at best.. As mentioned above, the first 4 cameras are good for an over view of your property but if something happened there is NO WAY you'd be able to ID the person from more than 10 ft away as the cameras are fuzzy.. You'd be able to see their clothing but that's about it.. I then used my other 4 cameras to place on sidewalks where someone would have to walk to get into my home and those cameras help ALOT.. Their still not great but again, it was a $300 system.. I looked at digital systems and they are like $2,000.. This system isn't great but if I moved I buy the same exact one again.. But with 8 cameras and the extra long cords..With 8 cameras the system will record for about 8 days before over writing the old video.. I wished I got a bigger hard drive but that can always be upgraded later..", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Company/Great Product", "Author": "HeyMrL", "ReviewID": "R1YAH9ZK4RAQ8Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The company was very accomodating.

Utterly useless.", "Author": "King Dingbat \"KingDingbat\"", "ReviewID": "R19HZAWLHZWEA0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "===UPDATED===DO NOT expect this system to help you identify any criminal or person, or even a vehicle. After about a week of use, which now includes trying to playback video, I have decided to update my review and knock it down to one star. I can't understand why anyone would like this set. To say I'm extremely disappointed is an understatement. If the system didn't take me so long to install, I would send it back immediately. Who wants to deal spending more time to take everything down now? Tech support is non existent (See below) and online help is a joke. I have yet to be able to view these cameras over the internet or my smartphone and cannot get help to troubleshoot.--Image Quality--One of my main complaints is that the cameras are terrible at dealing with light and exposure levels. I wish there was a night vision intensity setting, or exposure settings, which would make them so much better. We live in Southern California where it's always sunny. Don't expect to be able to see anything if your camera is pointed at a surface the sun touches. Just the reflected light will wash out your video nearly completely, and forget trying to view any direction which is even slightly towards the sun itself. We get the best quality image (from light conditions) right now about 8:30am to 11am. (Basically, when it's overcast, before the sun burns off the night clouds.)Then there's the IR lights at night. First, if you have any sort of standard lights (Porch lights, motion lights, garden lights, etc.), the cameras are oblivious to them and do not adjust their images to include that light. The infared light is always on, and by itself easily ruins any image from the camera if you're not careful (Don't point the IR light cameras at any surface closer than 20 feet away, or BAM wash out!). Together the IR light with your regular home lighting completely ruins the picture.Speaking of the picture, the advertising says \"provide crystal clear video image at day and night\" which is a blatant lie. I did not expect these cameras to be HD at all, but the images these cameras produce at the highest quality settings, in the best light of the day are horrendous. and I can't imagine them being able to positively identify any would-be thief. I couldn't even recognize the vehicle of one of my regular contractors, and it has enormous graphics emblazoned on it. Additionally, the video is grainy and has wavy lines throughout each picture. I have read that the video quality degrades the longer the cables are that you use, but I cannot imagine many outdoor home installations that can use the only 60 ft cable they provide for each camera. Some cameras could be within 60 ft of the DVR unit, but if you install them properly (going around corners, hidden under eves, etc.) you're going to have to buy extensions for at least some cameras.Colors are pretty washed out, but color is generally unimportant to me, except I'm jealous of the nice color I see from other people online. There are color settings in the settings, but they are generally useless.--Playback--After recording for a week or so, I decided I wanted to investigate who was letting their dog poop in my front yard. The software is cumbersome, and I was shocked to learn that the \"video\" is more like a *slideshow* as the DVR only records about 1 or 2 frames per second, despite my having it set to \"Full\" which is supposed to be 30 FPS. I can improve the frame rate, if I lower the resolution of the recording, but honestly, how useful is that when the resolution is so bad in the first place? Speaking of resolution, I was shocked at how small the video files are when played back on a computer, after export. If I choose the highest resolution \"D1\" setting which sacrifices frame right, the video file at 100% size in my computer's media player is about 3 inches wide. If I switch to the \"CIF\" resolution, which sacrifices resolution for frame rate, its about 2 inches wide. WHO THE HELL CAN SEE A FACE CLEARLY AT 2 or 3 INCHES?! When you enlarge the video it makes the video completely unusable because it is so grainy. NOTE that these are at \"BEST\" and \"Full\" quality settings in the DVR settings.The maximum FF speed is 16x, which I was unhappy about at first, because when going through hours of video, it still takes lots of time to find any activity. However, I realized that any faster and you probably wouldn't see anybody any of the action in the preview. I think a \"Skip to movement\" button would probably help, but overall, it's not too hard to find what you're looking for, especially if you have any sort of idea when the activity happened.Clipping snippets out of playback and exporting to a USB drive was very easy. Probably the easiest thing about this system.--Installation--Installation was quite a chore, taking me several days and lots of frustration. I would return this product in immediately if it didn't take me a whole week to install. Also, You cannot invert an image in the system settings, so I when I needed to install the cameras upside down (which is almost every camera) I had to take them apart and rig them in ways that were not intended to make the cameras hang right-side-up. Unfortunately, I learned this the hard way, because I assumed any decent camera system would allow me to invert or rotate image signals.It is important to note, that the documentation is terrible and does not include trouble shooting, and online help is virtually useless as it only duplicates the paper documents. I still have yet to get the system to work over the internet or on my smartphone, and when I tried to chat with tech support, they put me on hold for 15 minutes and then the department \"was unavailable\" and it told me to leave a message. The message went unanswered.I wouldn't buy this set again.

I had some backyard stuff stolen and a garage break-in where a 150cc scooter and an expensive ladder was also stolen. It infuriated me that I could not see who they were, how many etc... cops do nothing in these cases, but the insurance company paid me for the scooter which was great. so that was then. With 8 cameras it is just enough to hit every angle of our 2 family house and backyard. We have ours in the kitchen connected to a 19 inch monitor, for us it's the center of the house were there's always someone doing something, or you have to pass by it. I also set the DVR on the local network so all the computers or wireless laptops in the house can see all the cameras too anytime with a click. The software is decent, we just leave it always running on every computer in the background and either minimize it or maximize it to see what's going on around the house. It's nice to look out, see what the kids are doing, check what the dog is doing, if the cat wants to come into the house, who it's barking at, who's at the front or back door ringing that bell, see if the deliveryman already dropped off that package, if there's mail in the mailboxes, who's parked and where around the house. This Zmodo system is sufficient for a typical family, for me it is easy to operate, quality is OKAY, i have manually set the main recording bit rate to 2048Kbps and 512Kbps for the substream (the substream decides the quality and speed of the cameras viewed through the network) which is the highest you can go, however with the 500GB hard drive it can only store data for about 4 days and 4 nights at this quality, then it starts overwriting data of course. I will likely upgrade to a 2GB drive once this one dies given they aren't very expensive. The white cameras blend easily on our white house and garage. A few of the cables weren't long enough so I used 2-pair cat3 phone wire to splice and extend them, there's only 3 very thin wires inside these camera cables, so splice carefully and use solder to make good connections. No loss in quality whatsoever even on quite long runs. Took about two days to run wire and probably another hiding the wire, tucking everything in and patching up and caulking holes etc. It is also a good idea to untwist every camera's lens cover and apply a small amount of weatherproofing lubricant, such as lithium grease to the treads, that way you wont just rely on the small rubber gaskets inside these and they can easily unscrew later for cleaning and wont seize up. Once I was satisfied with all the camera positions I also put a little marine goop glue to the camera holder arms so they won't move in strong winds as those mounts can be a bit flimsy otherwise. Overall, satisfied, we've had these now for about 6 months installed and I would never live again without the convenience of cameras around my house", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "very nice, decent resolution ok night vision", "Author": "Rob", "ReviewID": "R2WUVR20GLC6GO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I too was upgraded from 480tvl to 600tvl without extra charge a pleasant surprise, I will say that installation of this product is labor intensive Ive spent most of my Saturday installing 6 of the 8 cameras, I would give this item 5 stars however 2 of the cables delivered were busted and I routed them through my entire house before finding this out (I was not enthralled) I will be contacting the seller to ask that those cables be replaced other than that time will tell, I haven't attempted to configure the DVR portion or the Internet access as of yet, I will be back with an update should anything unexpected occur.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Problems with Android Phones", "Author": "Caballo \"Jorge\"", "ReviewID": "RSCNU26TID04Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did install this cameras and the system.

You won't be able to make out a plate or an exact face but you can SEE.  Night vision is not great unless you have some ambient light somewhere but I have plenty of that around my house so it works for me.  The motion recording is a bit weird but it works also and has a delay to capture that moment even after the motion object has stopped.

I didn't buy this intending to ID intruders or read license plates. I only came in with the expectation of being able to see human beings, an opposum, and a racoon, that's all.Video quality: For my purposes (see above) it is as good as I expected it to be and does its job well.Camera installation: I'll admit, I'm a bit embarrased to say this but perhaps someone else may not realize this either. I couldn't figure out how to mount this to my roof overhangs outside. None of the cameras came with any instructions. It finally dawned on me that if you take the weather shield off the top, you can screw the mounting base into that now available hole (I know, but in my defense I hadn't slept good in about a week). So, there you go.Network setup: First, I see a lot of people complaining that the network was hard to setup. If you don't know what you're doing, it will be hard to set up. I had no idea how to do all the port forwarding, IP checking, DVR setup, mobile phone setup, etc. So yes, it took me a couple of hours as a networking novice. Now that I've done it and understand how all this networking business works, I could get it setup again in about 1/10th the time.Remote viewing from a PC: Internet Explorer setup was pretty straightforward. Just change the ActiveX controls, remember to check the box on the logon page and you're in.Remote viewing from an Android phone: I used IP Cam Viewer and setup was again pretty straightforward after I came to understand the network lingo.Overall, this system does exactly what I intended it to do and what I bought it for and setup was not a big deal (and as a bonus, I got to learn a lot about networking). Having this system now, it makes me want to upgrade to a 16-channel DVR and add cameras piecewise to my current 8 cameras.Gripe: The IR night view is a little weaker than I hoped. I will probably augment my system by building a couple of 890nm or 940nm IR LED strips to illuminate my exterior walls a bit better. I haven't decided exactly how I'm going to build these light bars yet, or if there is a product already out there that I can hack together to make an IR LED light bar. I'm not really interested in the IR floodlights since I don't have any cams that need to sense a very broad angle. Just a 10ft strip of IR LEDs that all face down. My thought right now is to buy 100 or so SMT LEDs and mount them on a flameproof 10ft piece of plastic connected together by thin tinned copper wire in parallel. I would probably build a custom 1.5V power supply (to be able to omit that voltage divider resistors) with a linear regulator or two in an IP67 enclosure with a built-in photosensor trigger.
