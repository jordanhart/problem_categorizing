I did some research on this product a found that the item can't work in U.S. Because of various frequency related issues. These are being mass produced in China by various \"Mom and Pop\" factories.

It works exactly as described. I can either call the SIM number and listen in or send the sound activation code and it calls me. Then after I hang up it sends a text message with location coordinates. Unfortunately the sound quality is so bad that nothing can be understood. I can hear people talking but the sound is too distorted to derive anything intelligent out of it. To me that makes the device completely useless.", "Date": "May 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love the James Bond in it.", "Author": "Abdul Abdullahi Tafarki Argungu", "ReviewID": "R3I1B99BPSIIXL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's absolutely worth the buy,the clarity and secrecy is superb most important the portability and simplicity is worth the Money expended.", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "It works great!

It's tiny and discreet making it easy to conceal.  Despite its' small size, it's a high quality device, providing clear sound quality, long standby duration (around 2 days) and 1-2 hours constant use (extendable with a portable power-bank).\nThe device works via a Mobile Pre-Pay GSM SIM card (the older large style). Simply insert a Pay As You Go / Pre-Pay GSM SIM into the device and call it to turn the device on and start listening. Not only will you be able to hear through walls and doors, but you can literally dial in from anywhere in the country or world!\nCall to listen OR set Voice Activation: when there is a sound above 45db within 10 metres of the device, you will be called to listen.\n** IMPORTANT PLEASE READ ** The LAYEN CSB requires a GSM network (not CDMA) and runs off four GSM frequencies: 850/900/1800/1900 MHz. It works exactly like a mobile with service/ reception etc. It will not work if the SIM card requires an IMEI number to activate it, as the CSB does NOT have an IMEI number to enable this.\nBrand New. Please Ignore Amazon's Estimated Delivery Times (both before and after purchase) LAYEN dispatches all orders within 24 hours. Delivery approx. 7-10 days.", "Name": "LAYEN CSB - Home Security Audio Surveillance.
