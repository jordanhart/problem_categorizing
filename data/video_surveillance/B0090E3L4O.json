{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Helpful TIps for this system", "Author": "Bobby", "ReviewID": "R3GU6N4JEZNAUQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is lengthy but hopefully helps someone out there!Purchase this system if you want a DIY system and have some light experience with home maintenance, can work basic tools like a drill and screw driver and understand how to follow directions to the \"T\". This system out of the box was a great idea, everything worked exactly as it said it would and the set up was easy (even though it took me a few tries to get the network set up for mobile viewing). The interface is a little heavy to deal with but the manual explains it a little, the rest is a learning process. I'll add as much infor as I can to help you out if you have purchased this system already. The hardest part of this entire project was getting in the attic and bringing these cables together from all sides of the house to trail them down along side my security system wires, into the basement and over to where I store the DVR. The camera's come with power supply in the line, which is why I bought the system so as long as you have available plugs (1 adapter for every 4 cameras) near the DVR box you'll be fine.Things to know:1. Be realistic about your distance. I purchased this system knowing I'd never use all 16 cameras but I wanted extra cameras in case one was bad, one went bad or I wanted to add more later. This gave me more than double the length per camera, the system comes with 60' cables for each camera so now I had 120' per camera for my install.2. Purchase BNC connectors, female to female to connect two lengths of cable together, the power supply will connect but the ends of the BNC cables are female.3. You need an ethernet cord (cat-5), for mobile viewing. The DVR connects to your router and stays connected for this. If you dont want to view online or from your phone disregard this.4. You need a VGA cable and a monitor that has a VGA hook up, dont expect your new T.V. to have a VGA input on it like I did, everything apparently is going the way of HDMI so make sure you have one available, you can set your laptop up to be the monitor as well but keep in mind that wherever you are setting the DVR box up is where you will be doing all of this system work and you'll need to see the screen. Also, there is a VGA to HDMI adapter available but they are expensive ($60) but this is also an option.5. Be prepared for the install, be realistic with yourself. I always fool myself into thinking that everything is going to be so easy... well guess what? It never is! Mostly because I live in a home that was built in the 30's but thats another review altogether. What I can say about this is that I was doing all kinds of tricks and contortion up in the attic to weave in and out of the rafters and through all the freshly blown in insulation, it was not pleasant. You might not be going this route at all though and can easily organize your cables some other way on the outside of your home. For me I wanted to conceal everything and save cable by taking the straightest line possible.6. Get ready for the setup, its tricky, what I can say is follow the manual, then go online and watch a few tutorials if you have any trouble.7. Zmodo has a tutorial on their website, the address is in the instruction manual, it takes you step by step through the network process for mobile viewing. This was the best for me because of where my DVR is stored, accessing it regularly would be inconvenient and you can control all aspects of recording and camera controls online. Thinks I remembered running into were:your router password and the password used to log into the system from the online screen are not the same. Initially you will have to set up your router ports. then you'll be accessing the system to control the DVR/Cameras. The system login and password and the online login/ password are the same until you change it.take note of what your ports are, they will be designated by numbers like 80, 5050, 6050 and 7050 but each one has a job, your DVR menu will tell you what they do (media, command etc.) take note of this, you'll need the Command port number for the online login and the register port number (80 or 8080) for the phone/ipad/tablet apps.on the DVR menu for network, make sure your IP Access option is turned OFF, I know this sounds weird but for the system it means that any device (with the password) can access the IP cameras. I had this set to something else that makes real sense to me but not to the system :( It took me forever to figure this out.In the manual under Network Operation it goes through what looks like a checklist for how you are supposed to set up the DVR. This is not what that is, to set up the network for online viewing the only thing you need to do is have your IP address and the port numbers and meanings written down, select IP access and select OFF and then follow the online tutorial provided by the website.when viewing the cameras online or on the DVR you'll have to adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing, but in the parameters you can set these permanently and that is how it will be recorded.The recording playback has settings that you can set yourself for each camera, either through the DVR or Online, the quality of recording is manual so you have to select it depending on your needs, I have all mine set at BEST.In the parameter settings you set how each camera records, this will not happen automatically. Things to know are: select the mode at which you want the camera to record first before selectings days and time on the schedule box, the selections include MOTION DETECTION, CONTINUOUS and a few others, when selecting days and i times in the schedule box the selection will change the color of the recording type you chose, that way you know. CLICK SAVE AFTER EACH CAMERA CHANGE!I think thats it really... if you have any questions let me know. I'll answer them to the best of my ability.Also, I submitted a customer picture for this system, you can view that to see what kind of quality the cameras produce. It's the one with the time stamp white boxed out.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera Feed and color", "Author": "Alvin Cameron", "ReviewID": "R3GVGGUM6LD97P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing realist color and camera feed... unbelievable.

First off these cameras are not what is advertised. They are nowhere near a \"Sony\" well at least nowhere on the cam says \"Sony\". Some of them did not work from out of the box. SIX. (so that's a waste of money). Upon installation and a test run i noticed right away the image was not as expected , when on full screen you cannot recognize anything and don't get me started when the night vision kicks in, that's like a blind man reading a newspaper. I tried tweeking here  there on the DVR but no luck same old crappy  image. When i would review the recorded images that's worst, so i don't know if there is a break in anywhere what i can do to recognize anyone. I was better off without these cams. I am sure a webcam is better than this piece of  thing. I think the seller advertise something and send a different product to customers. Funny thing is i am living all the way in South America and will not even bother to send this back and \"WASTE\" more of my hard earned money. This is a rip off do not buy these cameras and regret like me. I am sick and tired of trying to make contact with Zomodo. Do not buy this Product it's a waste of money. I am never buying back a zomodo product and definitely not buying back from this seller.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "exactly what i was looking for...", "Author": "yazan daas", "ReviewID": "R1RTULL751B7X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Exactly what i was looking for...very good price durable easy to install outdoor camera sizes are perfect...better connections= better picture quality..recommened BNC compression coax connectors.. more work but its worth it", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "As advertised.", "Author": "Ibrahim Salami", "ReviewID": "RZX5JEGWGY41L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product works fine, The cameras are wide angles(especially the domes).

Do not buy from this vender!!!!", "Author": "Camille Wojtasiak \"Camille\"", "ReviewID": "RDZ3TNKZZRXR4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Update: Got a great deal at Costco online for a quality surveillance system.  Best part is that it comes with an 18 month warrantee. These ZMODO systems only come with a three month warrantee.  It took me a while to get the installation scheduled essentially making their warrantee useless for me.  The system never worked and the support from the vender was insulting. If I ever get a working unit from the vendor, I'll let you know.  If I do, I guess I can sell it on craigslist to recover a small portion of the money I spent.  If you buy from this vendor good luck!!  If the system works, it sounds like a good deal from other reviews.  If it dose not, then you can loose $550 as I did.  I would not buy from this vendor under any circumstances.  I will not buy electronics from Amazon again.  The amount I have saved by buying electronics on Amazon was seriouly lost with this one purchase.  Buyer beware.Update: Buying electronics on Amazon is only good if everything goes well.  After this purchase gone terribly wrong, I've gone back to buying electronics from best buy. You can buy online but you can also go to the local store if you have problems. At the very least do not buy from this vender. They have no interest in supporting their products.Original Post: Not working. Now in a bind and a rush, and have to buy another system after spending $550. Very stressfull.

However for those people that are not familiar with home security camera systems here a couple of things that I have learned in the past month and my opinion of the Pros and Cons.Notes:1. Security camera footage is not as clear as personal cameras and camcorders. (based on my workplace cameras, Dlink experience, local security camera store and this system.)2. Going with a system like this will cause more headaches upfront. (Networking, running cable...etc)3. Look into getting a power box to power your cameras feeds. (Every camera has a power and a signal cable.)4. Remote viewing is a headache if you arent familiar with things like \"Static IPs\", \"Port Forwarding\" and \"DDNS\".5. Research to see if you need PTZ (Pan, Tilt, Zoom) functionality. (I think that this package supports it but non of the cameras are PTZ style.)Cons:(NOTE:I have not tried to get any support for this equipment so I can't speak on that.)1. Cables may be short for larger homes.2. Night Vision does not have long range and looks similar to a flashlight view.3. The motion detection does not allow you to set areas to be detected. (IE: Some systems allow you to highlight the just the windows for motion.)4. I'm not crazy about the mobile app but it does work.5. Motion detection is a hassle to get set just right, but I have this issue with all cameras I tried.Pros:1. The system seems to be reliable.2. The ability to recognize faces IS BETTER then the DLink products I tried. (I think to see a face clearly the camera has to be within about 15 feet.)3. Field of view is larger then the Dlink products I tried.4. There are a lot more options for recording preferences then my Dlink equip.5. Easily exandable.6. From what I can tell the cameras are decent quality and all have been working okay.7. This system is better for me long term. (Dlink required accounts logins to be created through their site.)8. All access to my careas are controled from my home.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "great cameras", "Author": "Amy Frebis", "ReviewID": "RS6L0CPXJC03Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Cameras are great.

Yes I bought this exact system, thinking this was going to be great, and technically, it is a pretty good system, easy to install, good camera imaging, and moderate cost. but there is a sneak up problem here, that should be totally revealed, even before purchase! I bought this set up because I live alone, and work every day away from home and this looked like a good way to monitor my home and dogs from my smartphone. and it probably works well for alot of people in this way......BUT, if you are a life long Verizon customer like myself and have LTE 4G smart phone, NONE of this is going to work on your cell phone, other than thru your wifi.....Yep, Verizon has a permanant firewall within their 4G that prevents you from viewing your ZMODO DVR cameras other than your wifi!  Now Logically, shouldn't this be mentioned somewhere in advertising or specifications for this system? They had to know it. Like I doubt I am the first one who has made this dumb mistake. Yes, I know the problem is posted all over the web, but, I really had no clue at the time. If you have Verizon LTE, there is only one solution for remote monitoring with a camera, purchase a Cloud based camera, its the only way around the Verizon firewall right now. and Yes I know there is another way, you can purchase a fixed IP from Verizon for 500.00, one time payment. well thats not exactly the way either, you must prove you are at least \"a small business\" and it is a yearly fee, according to Verizon business division office!, so is that really a solution?  Thank You for reading this, I hope everyone does, before buying this system, Come On Zmodo, set up a Cloud based web service and solve this dilema!", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "SWEET! magnetic bracelet !", "Author": "Fred \"snoxers\"", "ReviewID": "R34NPDMS4UK4H8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Classy look and well made piece.
