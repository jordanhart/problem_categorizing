{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Vivotek IP8332 for home monitoring", "Author": "Miguel Lombana", "ReviewID": "R12V6RQ3RM7N56", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been looking to update my analog camera system and DVR and wanted to invest in a quality megapixel IP solution that I could rely on to give me images that could actually be useful in the event that something happened at my house and I needed evidence.The Vivotek IP8332 was recommended time and time again on various forums and I was able to find video demos on YouTube that seemed to show that this was a great investment for under 500 bucks per cam, which in the world of IP cams is actually very cheap!The manual is a bit sketchy but if you read through it and go into the menus and experiment you can easily figure it out and get some amazing results.The camera has the ability to stream 4 different quality and resolution streams via web interface, droid or other smartphone, email pictures of events or upload to a storage device such as a NAS. Using the built in Linux OS it even has the ability to setup Dynamic DNS and IP forwarding for access outside of your network. I use IP Cam Viewer Lite (Free for up to 5 cams) on my droid and am able to keep tabs on everything at home even when away.In my situation I have setup several motion detection boxes on each cam and when triggered they will record to a local drive using the included and free ST7501 multicam software, take several frame grabs and both store them on a server and email them all in 1280 x 720 HD yes it's a 1 megapixel cam which is the low end of HD but it's HD none the less.The only drawbacks that I've found is the low light image quality, it's far better than the old analog cams that I had in the past but I've yet to find the secret sauce that was used in the videos that I've seen on YouTube. My lighting conditions aren't pitch black in fact there is a fair amount of street and house lighting but I've obviously setup something wrong since I've not been able to match the quality they showcase in their videos. In the day time, it's another story, the images are super crisp and ultra high quality.On a recent UPS delivery the driver didn't deliver a package that was supposed to be there that day by 10:30am, at 5:30pm the tracking updates to say that delivery attempt was unsuccessful and would be attempted the next day. I went over the recordings and pics, found the driver had been to my house at about 11am was there for 20 seconds, never got out of his truck and left. I called UPS, emailed them the pics and a new driver was there the next day with my package, I guess it was hard to argue with the time/date stamps and the license plate of his truck on my cams!", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good build but terrible firmware", "Author": "Scuber", "ReviewID": "R2K5ARABPBJ76L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The IP8262 is physically a well built IP camera, but that is where it ends.  There is a focus assist which is meant to help you get the focus as precise as possible.  The problem with the focus is that the slightest movement of the adjustment will through it way out of focus.  It needs to have a much finer adjustment.  I have played with it for 3 days now and have given up getting a nice sharp picture.  I have a 2Mp web-cam that I paid $79 for that has a much better picture than this camera.  The web-cam even does better in low light than this camera - regardless if the IR is on or off.The next problem is with the firmware.  It is very fluky dependent on the make and version of the browser you use.  Some of the configuration pages will work with Firefox and not IE and other pages in the configuration are just the opposite.  As an example, Firefox will let you drag and drop to adjust the window size for setting up motion triggers but IE will not work unless its an older version.  One browser won't let you adjust the maximum Mb size of a video capture (your limited to just over 8Mb per video) but Firefox will work.Although I can get around most of the aggravation with the configuration program, there is one glaring problem that makes this camera just not worth getting.  Unless someone can prove me wrong, when you set up the camera to trigger on motion.  You can only capture 7 pre-event frames the actual event image and up to 7 post-event images.  That is a total of 15 seconds of snapshot images.  The problem is that you can not get the camera to continue capturing snapshots immediately after the previous motion trigger.  No matter what I do, I end up with about 12 seconds of missing action.  I can't imagine why someone would want to get 7 pre-event images - they usually don't have anything significant in them.  So what you end up with is 7 images covering 7 seconds and then you have to wait another 10-12 seconds before it does it's next set of images.  By then you've lost perp - he's already in the house!  If you have this camera please prove me wrong.  18-20 seconds is a long time when someone is coming across your patio and breaking into a window.  You may get a couple images and the rest would most likely be be entirely missed.  It isn't quite as bad with video.  I haven't tested a bunch yet but I think there are only 12 seconds missing between video captures.  You can only capture 20 seconds of video with the camera software.  Even if you are saving the data onto a NAS, the trigger will only allow you to save 20 seconds at a whack and that just isn't enough.  Try capturing a series of images and videos with the timestamp on them and see how much time is MISSING.So if you are buying this for onboard video / snapshot capturing ability or the ability to send data directly to a NAS from the camera, I'd say continue looking.  There are much better cameras out there that produce a much better image and give you the ability to capture more frames and longer videos than this one does.  If you don't care about this functionality, then give it a try.  Good luck getting a nice clear image from this thing....", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Flaky software", "Author": "C. Quarles", "ReviewID": "R2OYU7DHL07SWA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Camera image is pretty good, construction is high quality, and POE works well.  But the motion detection software, when connecting directly through a browser, has some issues.  The window sizing is buggy- where you think you are putting the motion detection window doesn't match with where it is placed in actuality.  The sensitivity for motion detection is poorly explained in the manual and online support; I've spent hour trying to calibrate the camera's motion detection at night and during the day.  I am contacting Vivotek's customer support to see what the issue is, so expect to see an update from me afterwards.  I've had the camera installed for a little over a month.  The product got great reviews, so I am surprised by my experience.  There are also few useful articles on the web that can help owners with troubleshooting, FYI.", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Overly expensive and may have firmware/night video issues", "Author": "Tom Servo", "ReviewID": "R3P4B99ZLUR22", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am familiar with security cameras/DVRs including IP cams. The Vivotek IP8332 has some good specs but it's disappointing on review.THE GOOD:+ Megapixel image, 1280x720, good day image in average light levels. Lens is 3.6mm (wide angle).+ Outdoor (weather resistant) cam, with Night vision (12 IR LEDs)+ Cam has internal microSD card slot for local storage recording (You do have to disassemble the cam to access the slot).+ Works with BlueIris (3rd party software)THE BAD:- The biggest flaw is the night mode internal reflections - the IR LEDs reflect on the plastic front lens \"glass\" and spoil the image. Other cameras solve this problem by having the LEDs well outside the lens area or isolating the lens from surrounding IR light and I see no reason why this camera should be different. The fact that the front \"glass\" is plastic and not quality glass is an indication that corners were cut here, but this is a critical part of a camera! I have verified that the front plastic is the problem by disassembling the cam and removing it but obviously you can't use the cam in an outdoor setting like this! Shame on you Vivotek for crippling an otherwise good camera!- The external cable is a thick black cord that splits into separate connections (for power, ethernet, etc). The dumb thing is that this cord is only about 6\" long and is annoying because for outside use you will need an IP56 rated box or enclosure within 6 inches of the camera! Why they couldn't give you 12\" minimum?- Firmware has been buggy for this cam, with newer firmware giving image & other problems. As of this writing latest firmware is v2.00 but firmware 1.05-1.08 has been known to be problematic.- This is not a PoE (Power Over Ethernet) camera - you will need to supply either with 24VAC or 12V using the included power adapter.OVERALL I am not happy with the flaws considering the price of this camera. It had the chance to be one of the better outdoor megapixel cams that I've tested.I hope you find this useful!", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than I expected", "Author": "Bog Flynn", "ReviewID": "RJNUXULDNV85S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This turned out to be a great video cam.  I had two qualifications for the camera I bought - IP capability and Megapixel capture.  I searched and googled for days.  This is a very well-made cam.  It is solid, metal, and pretty sleek.  Bigger than I expected - about 3\" in diameter.  It is quite simple to setup and I have it working through my firewall at home and easily visible from anywhere.  It has 4 video streams which you can customize (MJPG, MP4, H.264 modes).  The smartphone viewing doesn't work, but that may be an issue with my Android 2.1 and video format.  I will try with my iPod Touch (iPhone compatibility test).  The quality is quite good and a decent framerate is broadcast across the internet.  Motion capture is sensitive and can be customized for regions and percent of view, etc.  The infrared mode is excellent, kicks in however you set it up to.  You can use strictly B/W or infrared with color.  It literally sees in pitch black.  Infamous 'ghost orbs' show up, which show how dusty your house can be (haven't attached it outside yet).  All-in-all, I am very happy with this product.", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera - until the first rain!", "Author": "Casper Chauncey", "ReviewID": "RJPVKQOFT65T4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought 4 of these to watch over my house. I was thrilled with them -- until the first time it rained and 2 of them died. In the next rain, a third one died. The good news is I've been able to nurse two of them back to health. But you need to take the possibility of water damage seriously before choosing this camera.The advertising proclaims these as outdoor weatherproof cameras. Even the box says \"weatherproof housing\". Well the housing may be weatherproof but the cables going in the back ARE NOT. One camera filled up with water so much that when I took it down I was able to pour out a couple spoonfuls.The installation instructions warn that the cable end must be protected from weather. Since the cable is only about a foot long, you better be able to mount the camera somewhere you can drill a hole and get that cable passed through to an indoor area right away. Or run the cable immediately into a waterproof box -- which is difficult because the cable end is large meaning the box will need a large hole for the cable. Now how do you close up that hole?You are also told to open the camera housing and insert a small packet of silica gel (one included with each camera). If you ever open it again, you are to remove the old packet and replace it with another. So plan on finding a few extra. The warranty, of course, does not cover moisture damage from your failure to correctly prepare and install the camera as instructed.Two of the three cameras that died came back to life once they dried out. The other, that had the most water damage, lost its infrared emitter and eventually died completely.For the price I think the manufacturer should have passed the wires through some piece of solid plastic or rubber so no water could flow into the camera through the cable end.The mounting hardware also leaves a lot to be desired. You can't aim the camera just any direction -- the angles are limited. Also, though there are three adjustments to tighten, it never seems to hold the camera rigidly so the slightest bump will knock it out of alignment. The instructions do not explain how to adjust the mounting hardware at all.With all that said, this is a wonderful camera with fantastic performance and networking capabilities. Each one has its own embedded Linux system (not that you need to be aware of it) with a web server for easy setup from your browser. Networking is a breeze -- no special software required -- just plug in the camera to a Power-over-ethernet network cable and by the time you get back to your computer the camera has probably already obtained a DHCP address from your router and is ready to go. You can connect via several different protocols and picture resolutions simultaneously. These are fully supported by the free ZoneMinder software -- just set the video stream to JPEG 1280x800 30fps.The video is very clear, colorful by day and impressive at night with the infrared emitters. I would be totally happy with the pictures and the software if my infrared hadn't died in the rain. These are probably among the best cameras you will find in terms of day and night picture quality.I was planning to give this camera a rave review and order more -- until the water damage. Now I would recommend them primarily for indoor use, unless you are quite confident in your ability to protect the cable connectors from any moisture.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "OK outdoors so far. But firmware needs improvement", "Author": "Paolo M", "ReviewID": "R2J7R7LA99ZYKD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After three months of outdoor usage, my only criticism is with firmware. I was able to only peruse maybe 30% of the reportedly available software functionalities. (Example 1: Anti-tampering triggers for nothing, such as environmental conditions changing from dark to light! Example 2: With every different browser you will experience different behavior form the IP8332). Furthermore, as some commented here already, every new firmware release makes you regret the previous one; and user manuals and documentation are never up-to-date. In other words, software configuration management looks a bit amateurish; and I also suspect one should have Linux installed on his Pc to make this beast work smoothly.On the other hand, Support has proven good and effective so far.", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good price, but factory seems not to care about focus.", "Author": "N.
