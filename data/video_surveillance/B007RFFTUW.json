{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Limited features, but better than average image quality.", "Author": "B. Pearce", "ReviewID": "R30KQ1F3PI95EQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "These are technically 0.92 megapixel cameras (1280x720, a.k.a. 720p HD). It supports 30 frames-per-second video even at full resolution, which is great.  The shutter is fast, so moving objects have little or no blurring.I personally own 3 of these cameras, but they have several limitations that keep me from buying more:1.  The firmware is pretty bare-bones, as Ubiquiti intends for you to use the cameras with their (free) AirVision software.  At this time, AirVision is highly inefficient and buggy, but they are working on it.  Right now, Blue Iris is a better option for recording the video feed.  Advanced features like motion detection, video recording, email alerting, or even scheduled FTP image uploading are simply not possible without a server.  Basically the only output you get is h.264 video in an RTSP stream.2.  If you were thinking about using this camera for HD jpeg images, think again.  Jpeg still images are only available after logging in through the proprietary web interface.  So most 3rd party software will be unable to access the images.  Even if you can access them, the images are only available at 640x480 resolution (so much of the detail is gone).  If you need a camera with jpeg image support, look elsewhere.3.  There is NO night vision support (though I find that a motion-activated spotlight works okay).Despite these limitations, you simply cannot beat the video quality for the price with another outdoor camera.  For INDOOR cameras, however, Edimax has some strong competetors with much nicer firmware features and more pixels.", "Date": "July 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Low price, low quality video, complex software to use, no IR", "Author": "Antonio Comas", "ReviewID": "R5VOW41K0C26Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this 3 pack here in amazon.com and I am pretty impressed with the physical product. I have had them for a couple of weeks now and this is what I've learned.The packing and the design are great. For the amount of features these cameras have, I would have expected to pay much more. These cameras work great in well lit rooms but are completely useless in dimly lit rooms, also the Airvision software is designed for use by programmers (or in my opinion, the Linux crowd). I hear the Airvision software is based on Zone Minder, which is open source.I ended up buying the Blue Iris software after I read about people mentioning how easy it was to use. One thing I'll say about Blue Iris is, that for recording in Xvid format (which I've found to be the best compromise between quality/size/readability) it is VERY resource consuming. To record from 3 cameras simultaneously at the maximum resolution @ 30fps will bring a Quad Core AMD CPU @ 3.3Ghz to its knees. I don't believe the Airvision software shares this problem unless you enable motion detection (which I have disabled, since I have enough storage to record 24/7 anyway). Another thing I really like about the cameras is that they do not need PoE splitters. Coming from the older Panasonic VGA IP cameras that use PoE splitters after the power injectors, they are a definite improvement.I found the video quality these cameras put out to be heavily compressed and very soft. My older panasonic VGA IP cams can put out sharper images than these. The motion in the videos is very smooth if you record at 30fps. But the videos are NOT sharp at all. Too soft for head shots of people if you're running security in a store. This is at best comparable to 480p quality (on any decent IP cam) in good lighting conditions. In dimly-lit rooms people are unrecognizable at 10 feet away, the motion is still smooth as butter but their faces are completely unrecognizable due to the heavy compression.Bottom line is; I really like the cameras because of their price, but the software they bundle with it is mediocre and very difficult to understand and use (for someone not familiar with Linux, macros and scripts). I'll be waiting for the PRO line which I hear is due sometime this fall which will record in FULL HD and have IR.UPDATE: One thing that may help others that I neglected to mention in my initial review is, that when I first received this cameras a couple of them were out of focus. This cameras use a fix lens, but they use a spring loaded mechanism inside the lens cap to adjust the focus. I had to unscrew the plastic lens cap and manually tighten or loosen the camera lens with my fingers (easy if you have small hands) to get it to focus correctly. Not a big deal, but if you think the image looks too washed out it may be because the lens is out of focus.Lastly, after buying several licenses of Blue Iris and installing it on different workstations I've concluded that if you're are going to build a PC for exclusive use of video recording station, GET an INTEL i5 or i7 CPU. The difference in performance between a quad core i7 2700k for example and an AMD 3870APU is shocking. I had 4 of these cameras recording @ 10fps, 720P and 2 more recording @ 5fps, 720p for a total of 6, with motion detection on all 6 cameras. When all 6 were recording simultaneously the CPU usage would be between 70%-80% on the AMD system and that's without any playback going on. On the intel system I had all 6 cameras recording @ 10fps and the CPU usage will hover between 8%-10% leaving plenty of resources for remote playback and local playback, without the live recordings skipping frames.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's OK", "Author": "Pra \"PL\"", "ReviewID": "R1URQCY95BDCFA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera takes a slightly different approach to IP cams. It is supposed to be megapixel, but it's really not. Let me explain, the camera has very decent image quality, but it is very similar to a normal VGA Axis camera in that regard. If you compare it to an Axis MP camera it is nowhere near the quality. That being said, at the price that this goes for and the fact that it is indoor/outdoor, it is a winner. The software that is included is clumsy, you're better off using Blue Iris. You must run some sort of NVR software to record with this camera, as unlike many other IP cams, there is no FTP server included.  If you are looking for decent image quality and you pair with Blue Iris, you can't go wrong with this package for the price.

I don't recommend them for a couple of reasons unless you just want some hobby cameras, and mediocre ones at that.----------------------------------GOOD -Small, light and simple to set up.  Easily switched out.WhitePOEOn the network, so accessing them and setting them up with Blue Iris was very easyBAD -- Image quality is poor for a supposedly 720p cam.  When compared to a 700TVL BNC connected cam, the BNC is hands down the winner when the IP cam should be visibly more detailed.  They have contrast and brightness issues that are not fixed by using the brightness and contrast controls at the cam.  In bright light anything in a shadow is nearly invisible, rendering their use to identify activity in certain areas almost pointless.  I have one pointed at a hangar door painted dark blue with white walls and if someone steps into the shadow of the hangar while in front of the door they disappear, which was not the case with the other cameras.- They are so light that a strong breeze moves the camera, causing motion trigger to occur.- Completely plastic.  These feel like they will easily break at some point, either the mount or the cam itself, and the Florida sun will make that happen faster.  The lens cover is plastic with a plastic ring screwed on it to hold it down.  I will be surprised if they don't get water inside very quickly.  I hope I'm wrong.----------------------------------Very disappointed that these are so... flimsy, and the image quality is embarrassing.  I was hoping to move to IP CCTV but if these are any indication of what is out there, I am not optimistic.  My Logitech HD web cam has better detail than these.  I am not looking to spend nearly three times as much for IP cams (I now don't consider a $100 camera to be viable, and the next step up seems to be $200) if they are worse than the traditional BNC connected cams.", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Low Cost IP Camera", "Author": "GR Fire \"Gadget Geek!\"", "ReviewID": "R3TTP51GBVSMAE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, the picture quality is excellent.

When we first deployed them (summer 2012) we liked the cameras but the AirVision software had many issues. So initially we monitored the cameras using the Milestone XProtect Smart Client which we have a license for. We tested the AirVision 2 Beta when it was released and found only a few, very minor issues which have since been fixed in the final release. Considering that AirVision is included in the price of the cameras they are very hard to beat for the price.Pros:-The video is smooth and we have no issues using them at 30FPS. Once focused properly the images are clear and detailed.-The AirVision software is easy to use and configure. It even comes with configurable analytics to fine tune motion detection that works very well.-AirVision 1 stored the video as a large number of still images whereas AV2 now allows for saving the files as MP4.-PoE (with supplied PoE injector) which is exactly what we needed.-The mounts don't seem that sturdy upon first inpection but in use they are fine.Con-Manual focus is a little tricky and needs to be done by 2 people. One focusing the lens and one monitoring the feed.When we first started using these cameras we loved the hardware but found the software too unstable to be usable. Since the release of Airvision 2 that has changed entirely. No more dropped connections, bloated file sizes and flakey motion detection. I do wish there was an audio option but there is a \"Pro\" version rumored to be on the way that includes audio.Considering the cost, quality and the included DVR/monitoring software these are a very good deal.
