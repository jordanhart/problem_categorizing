The cameras themselves I think are decent, and Zmodo's customer service was excellent - no complaints there at all, very nice, very helpful.  What was very disappointing was the software.  The process to set up each camera - unless you are fairly computer savy, would prove incredibly frustrating, and even for those that can set it up themselves, the process you have to go through to set up each camera takes heroic patience.  And even if you manage to get the camera set up correctly and it works, the software to view the camera does not always work, and you're sitting there trying and trying to get the software to even respond.  Then there's the recording system.  The software to run that, by today's standards, seems either archaic or designed for someone who's a computer programmer by night and can appreciate it.  I honestly didn't feel secure that whatever I set to record would actually get recorded because of how the software was set up, etc.  If you want my review summed up in 4 words -- cheap junk from China.  That's basically what it is in a nutshell.  Would not recommend it.  That being said, they did promptly refund my money and even reimbursed half of the original shipping cost as well.", "Date": "October 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Cameras", "Author": "Joann", "ReviewID": "R3QKISKOSGHOEV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Because of the instructions the initial set-up was Very difficult(programming the cameras)......But once I figured it out-it was a breeze.I had to repeat ALL the steps several times for each camera before they finally picked up a signal.

I can see the cameras in real time!- no issue with Night vision, though not sure if it does 60ft. more likely 30 but no big deal.- customer support is at par with my expectations (am a tech support my self).- motion detect works, but make sure you have updated firmware. tech support can give it to you.the bad- see the reviews of this not being easy to set up? its true! as a tech support guy my self, i disregarded the fact that there were a number of reviews out there saying this is hard to set up. I told myself, \"what a bunch of noobs!\"  i was so wrong.  they were right! forgive me amazon reviewers, i doubted you!- not sure if its a bad thing but keep in mind that while the network connectivity is wireless, but unlike your laptops or ipads, it has no battery and you would need a nearby power source. so before buying, plan out where you want to put the cameras and make sure you have a power plug nearby. for me, i just used my old extension cords i used last Christmas and it worked perfectly :-)- could not add any more cameras! thats just 4! bummer! i think the limitation is the software of the nvr.- not sure if its another bad, but you can only use IE as it uses activex. unless you can make this microsoft application run in chrome or firefox, good luck!some tips:- before you set it up, watch the online video. watch it twice, do not even think that its easy because it took me a total of 4 hours to set it up. and i am a techie!  dont get me wrong, the actual physical set up is a breeze. setting up the sofware is a challenge. so be prepared. grab a coffee, grab a snicker bar, tuck the children to bed firs.. you will need all the concentration on this one. crack your fingers and be ready for a challenge.-  don't mount the camera's yet until its working for  you and rebooted it atleast 5 times. prior to upgrading the firmware,  i rebooted it (the camera) once, it retained the config.  installed it with ladders and all. power blip happened, lost all connectivity.... frustrating.- inital setup will require that you plug the camera to a network port. so put it all near your computer while setting it up. and yes, grab a coffee or coke...- even before opening the box, call tech support and make sure that they give you the latest firmware update for both the cameras and nvr.  The reason why it took me too long to set it up was because i keep loosing the saved details in the cameras. apparently i just did not have the updated firmware. had i updated it the first time, it would have saved me a lot of time.  once you intially set it up, upgrade the firmware. that should help.- visibility is ok, but night vision captured image might be a challenge to recognize. so i placed one of the cameras in the hallway entrance of my house in that way i can take a good picture on whoever comes in.- when you are all set up, and want to set up motion detect. please make sure that the interval of it taking a screen shot and sending to your email is long enough.  i made a mistake of a 2 second interval for 24 hours and put it into sensitive mode.  the result?  i received 1900 + emails.  even the camera flicker is considered a motion and sends me an email.  there is an option in the camera it self (accessed via IE) to only activate motion detect at certain times of the day.", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Its good enough but I was expecting a better night view", "Author": "Carlos", "ReviewID": "RNZGKANLIJKTW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Like my friend below said, \"the initial set-up was a torture...

I was able to install and configure this system without calling Zmodo or looking at the documentation much beyond checking to see what the default login ID and password are.But you will struggle with setup. I almost guarantee it. Unless you are an IT professional, you will be pulling your hair out trying to figure out how to make it go.Once you get it configured, it seems to work well. night time range is not that great, but they sell IR emitters to deal with that. Daytime video quality is excellent. Cameras are sturdy and solid, with water resistant design - look very professional and realistic. Extruded aluminum housings with steel rain shields.The DVR unit itself is smaller than I expected - about half the size of a video DVD player. A piece of 8.5 x 11 paper can completely cover the unit.Some helpful information:The default ID is 'admin' and login is '111111'On the DVR, I plugged the mouse into the back of the DVR and configured that first. I plugged in Ethernet and allowed it to get a DHCP address, then assigned a static IP address on my network.Press the Save or Submit button on every page before proceeding to the next page.Download the IPCSearch software (not included in the box) to configure wired and wireless settings for the cameras. Press Save after every configuration change. If you change the IP address, close and reopen the configuration pane before continuing.Each camera is its own IP device with its own web server and configuration page. Once you have an IP address, you can use your browser to configure advanced settings.You must use Internet Explorer to configure the DVR or the cameras from the web.Fully configure ethernet for the cameras, then configure wireless. Let the camera run for a few minutes after connecting to wireless. If you don't, it will lose the connection when you move the camera to its final location.For each camera, set the wired and wireless connection to the same IP address.On the DVR, cameras will automatically configure, but only up to 4 IP addresses. You'll need to delete and re-detect cameras after the IP addresses have been all sorted out.Make sure your cameras are within good signal range of your wireless access point (wireless router). Some people report cameras falling off the network. I've been running my system for a day now with no drops.Use a wifi scanner tool (software is available for PC and Mac) to scan for neighboring networks and check that your network is not trying to use the same channel as one nearby.If manually setting wireless channels, remember that channels are not discrete. They partly overlap! Set your network to channel 1 or 11 to avoid overlapping with other channels as much as possible. If your router has an auto channel feature, use it.If you are struggling, contact an IT savvy person to help install. This is essentially commercial-type technology available at a consumer price. The upshot is that it is using commercial software as well - not designed to be user friendly. The people who install commercial security DVRs do this every day, all day, and know the quirks. You don't, so expect to take time to learn things as you go.It took me about 3 hours to work my way through the installation, and I know a lot about computers and networks. Most people should expect to take at LEAST 4 hours to install, more if you have never done anything like this and are on the phone with tech support.UPDATE -My DVR unit started rebooting by itself and eventually started hanging and freezing. I have sent it in for repair/replacement and am awaiting its return. Seems to be temperature-sensitive. It would hang up more when it is hotter in the room.UPDATE 2 -Received a replacement DVR today. They sent a brand new unit. It is working fine now - will see if it fails again after a month or two. Customer support was good. I just interacted via email and had no problems when I carefully described the problem and my troubleshooting steps. They just asked me to send the old one back as RMA and I got the replacement about a week later.", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Find another product", "Author": "C.

Opt", "ReviewID": "R2P26EQEHN88EU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this system mainly because it was going to be difficult to run wiring through walls, ceilings, etc. to place the cameras where I wanted them. Also the price was very attractive. Setup was not overly difficult if you know a little about routers and networking. The problem with the setup was that the cameras didn't always 'take' their settings. I had to do the setup over for a couple of the cameras until it 'stuck'. Same with the NVR. If I unplugged it it would lose it's settings. But eventually I got everything set up and working.The system is great...when it's working. The biggest problem is eventually every camera loses its connection. Sometimes it will reconnect itself after a while but you end up with a recording with gaps. Most of the time once a camera loses a connection it doesn't reconnect until you unplug it and plug it back in. And sometimes it takes doing that 3-4 times until it reconnects. And it's not an issue with a weak wireless signal (although that will cause you a lot of grief). I have strong signals where all my cameras are located. To test it I brought all the cameras in the same room with the NVR and the wireless router and let them run for a couple of days. They still eventually lost their connections. This system is totally unreliable to use for 24 hour surveillance. You have to keep an eye on your monitor and you'll be resetting cameras on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times a dayOn top of connection issues the internal clocks on the cameras can't keep time worth a crap. You can have them all synced together but within a few days they'll be off. And not by a little. By minutes. By the end of the month they'll be off by several minutes. Every camera will have a different time. Useless for security. On top of that the cameras won't sync to a time server by themselves (or the NVR). You have to log into the camera's internal webpage server manually and then sync it with a time server. Useless.The software on the DVR is junk. Although it was recently upgraded it's still archaic software running on some sort of linux system. One nice feature is that you can copy your video off the NVR to a USB memory stick. Unfortunately it will be in a video format that you can't view. Nor does the system come with software to allow you to view it. You have to use transcoding software to convert it to a format that will play on your computer.If you're going with a wireless system to avoid running wires rethink it. The frustration of running wires doesn't compare to a system that barely works.

All the cameras worked. The NVR worked nicely although the power cord seems sloppy at the transformer end. The instructions tell you how to do what you are looking for to set the system and cameras up. However, someone not used to setting up security systems and port forwarding and addressing the cameras might find it a very steep learning curve. What is missing is the \"why?\" I am not familiar with the concept of looping for instance. It would be helpful to know why I would want to loop for instance.What really is troubling is the lack of motion detection. The instruction manual on disk shows how to set it up but the functionality doesn't exist on the equipment they shipped. Why would anyone be interested in a system that doesn't detect motion?!!!!I'd have given them five stars if it did motion detection because everything else seems satisfactory and for that I give them 2 stars but unless they come up with answers fast, I'm shipping this back on Monday.=====Update 12/01/2012: Zmodo responded to tell me that motion detection does work, just not with the main NVR unit. I also has to upgrade the firmware. Now, you have to log in to each camera through the IP address. You can't control the parameters remotely, at least not now. For that improvement I'm adding a star. The remote operation worked initially but now is refusing to let me access any of the NVR functions. I have several other IP cameras that work with no problems (HooToo and Agasio). Several times during the setup procedure the NVR changed parameters on it's own, like the Host forwarder provider information. I suspect that is what happened again because I have lost contact. At another time the NVR did a shutdown on it's own. These things make me very nervous about the product.If these things aren't fixed soon, I will have to downgrade the unit to one star.=====Update 09/30/2012: The motion detection still does not work.

Once connected the service technician was very helpful and walked me through steps before configuring the whole camera system by interacting with my computer and staying on the phone with me. I was very impressed on how quick,trained,and experienced the technician Matt was. Once finished Matt then explained  the info to connect from a smartphone. Matt saved the directions for me on the home screen so i can pull up the information anytime.The installation of the cameras was easy and the cameras have different ways of mounting the stand which I enjoyed.Still figuring out the different options on the camera screens but I downloaded information to help me through this.Thanks again and thanks Matt", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Peek A Boo,,, I See You", "Author": "dipstick", "ReviewID": "R3FK6N7LYDVJ51", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "installation was simple, programing was somewhat confusing, but when I called customer service, they were extreemelyhelpful, knowledgeable, and professional and got me set up quickly. the package arrived un damaged and on time.picture quality is excellent during daylight, at night, you need to supply some light to the target area, I've had camerasin place for around 20 years, this is the best system I've ever had.", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "thanks ......", "Author": "MAF", "ReviewID": "R2CC7NVZXXHGU9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "the good product which is identical to the specifications and you my sincere thanks ..... ..... .... ... ... ....", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Security Camera", "Author": "Richard Beavers", "ReviewID": "R1J33HU2XI08J5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Replaced a Swa\u00f1n security camera system with Zmodo.

I update the firmware and it was the same ol' crap..  To make story short, I ended up getting a new system from them because they claimed that mine had issues.. got it and the same problem.  The issue is that this crap has horrible night vision, doesn't save any of your settings to record by motion..  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE..  avoid purchasing this item..  just a waste of money..On top of this, the Customer Service manager by the name of Kelly (a man!), has horrible customer service, doesn't care about you as a customer, what made me crack up the most is that he doesn't know how to add dates..  He thought from Oct 31- Nov 16 was 23 days.. hahahahahah  what an idiot!HORRIBLE SYSTEM AND COMPANY WITH HORRIBLE TECH SUPPORT AND HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE..  JUST WASTE OF YOUR MONEY..
