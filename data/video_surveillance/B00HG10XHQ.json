And you don't notice them unless you're looking for them. I hang mine from the eaves that are about 7 feet up.At default settings, picture clarity and quality are excellent. Connected via CAT5, PoE resulting in strong signals--video frame rates is consistently near 30 frames per second. Easy to install. A snap to configure once you have the ActiveX Controls correctly installed. (More about this later.) Camera switches from day mode (color) to night mode (BW) without issue. Day mode has excellent color: brilliant color capture, detailed, accurate. Night mode captures details as far is the light source will reach which is about 15-20 ft. Beyond that it's hard to distinguish features.The lens on these cams can only be tilted up or down and can be slightly angled to either side.Field of view. In practical terms, near the camera (about 4 ft away) I can see nearly the full width of my driveway (3-car garage). At the end of the driveway (30ft), I can see about 100 ft of my 150 ft front yard.These units replaced a Logitech Alert 750e (NIGHT AND DAY DIFFERENCE in picture quality and now get full 30fps video). Used on Blue Iris system.* * ABOUT THEIR IMPLEMENTATION IN MY ENVIRONMENT * *I finally set mine up on a subnet after complaints from the rest of the family about bad internet connections and poor movie streaming. On occasion we had 6 streams of HD video hitting a 3 year old router: 3 from other internet connected devices and the 3 IP Cams.Bought 4 from 2 separate sellers. Manufacture dates 2013-05 (1X from CCTV-ONE), 2013-06 (3X from HD_Video_Depot). The side of the lens on the CCTV-ONE  unit clearly indicated that it was a 3.6mm lens (Model IP-DO3200C-3.6MM). Web server came set to English. Great resolution and performance from the get-go. The HD_Video_Depot units(Model IPC-HDB3200CN-0280B) had no lettering on the lens shell. The web server on these came set to Spanish. Out of these 3 units, 2 were defective--1 had slightly blurred pictures the other would randomly be show feed in hot pink or go unresponsive. From the router I can see that it's connected (IP address) but neither Blue Iris nor the IP Cam Config application can see it. The 3rd unit from HD_Video_Depot worked perfectly from the start. HD_Video_Depot had no issues with return of the defective units. Ordering a 5th one from CCTV-ONE.I'm not worried about lack of IR capability. Three 13 watt CFL lights each side of my 3-car garage clearly lit the driveway. (At last, finally found out who our newspaper delivery person is and what time the paper is delivered...he's getting a nice tip.) Two 13 watt bulbs on either side of front door clearly lit the entire porch. Also, I had already installed motion-activated flood lights prior to getting these cams.* * ABOUT SETTING UP THE CAMERAS * *These cameras come with DCHP enabled.ACTIVEX ISSUE and SOLUTIONOn 64-bit Windows you will need to MANUALLY REGISTER the ActiveX Controls in Windows registry. (I suspect that this may work, too, if you're encountering installation problems on 32-bit Windows.)The ActiveX Controls for the web interface will only work with 32-bit IE. (Tested on IE9 and IE10.) Not a problem if you're running 32-bit Windows. Problematic for 64-bit Windows.(1) On 64-bit Windows, the controls are placed in C:\\Program Files\\webrec\\Torch. Copy the entire folder contents to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\webrec\\Torch.(2) Manually unregister the components that were installed from C:\\Program Files\\webrec\\Torch.Start > Search > cmd.exe (Run as administrator) > \"cd\" to the directory above then enter the command \"regsvr32 /u filename.ocx\" for each.(3) Register the components that were copied to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\webrec\\Torch.\"cd\" to the directory above. Enter the command \"regsvr32 filename.ocx\" for each in that folder.I got all of the ActiveX components (video features) to work by doing Step 3 twice. I suspect the registration order/sequence was significant for at least two components. Live video would not work in Overlay config feature until I did Step 3 once more. I didn't bother \"getting to the bottom\" of this since things are working fine now.MICRO SD MEMORY ISSUENone of the 3 units I have would recognize the Class 10 16GB SanDisk Ultra Micro SDHC card. Didn't matter if in NTFS or FAT32 format. This card worked fine on my PC. No problems from my Hero2 and other cameras.Had no problem with a Class 4, 2 GB Kingston Micro SDHC card (Not sure if FAT32 or NTFS).", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Extremely Impressed.

I have it installed under an eve on my house and you'd have to be looking for it to ever notice it was there.  It is made out of good materials and it a bargain for the price, in my opinion.That said, this camera looks like it's PTZ, it is not.  Also, while it does very well in low light conditions, it is not IR night-vision.  My patio light provides enough light for this to not be an issue, but it's something to be aware of.  Additionally, this camera does not come with a power supply.  You will need a PoE switch, or PoE injector to power it.  It does not come with an AC adapter.My only complaint is the hole size required to install it.  It requires a hole slightly larger than a 1\" diameter.  I was able to use a 1\" bit but I had to run the bit around the sides of the hole to bore it out a tad more.  If the network port on the cable disconnected from the camera, such a large hole could be avoided.

Then I found this camera.  Great independent online reviews, price was substantially less than alternate products... so what's the catch?  I haven't found one.  As other reviews have stated, it's just the camera... no power adapter included, probably because it's assumed that this camera won't be used stand alone and you will need a PoE switch (a 4 port will cost you $50 to $150 or so).  I never used the included instructions, instead went to the 192.168.1.108 address to configure.  If your network isn't a 192.168.1.x setup just change your router temporary to that setup, log into the camera, change the IP address to whatever your network is, and change your router back.  Took me all of about 5 minutes with router reboots.The image is great in daytime and respectable at night.  There are no IR illuminators on this model which means it is completely dependent on ambient light to show an image.  No ambient light and it will be pitch black.  Turn on your front porch light or if you have a street light in front of your house and your in business.I bypassed the internal capturing methods and instead use Vitamin D running on my mac mini.  The camera isn't native to Vitamin D but a quick google search and you will find the appropriate settings and I was able to have it running within Vitamin D in 15 minutes or so.  I've had it running several weeks now and it works great.Things to be aware of.  It's not a PTZ camera, you will have to adjust the field of view and focus manually.  The ethernet connector requires a 1.25\" or so hole to have it pass through your wall.  I wasn't interested in drilling that large of a hole in my siding so I opened the camera up and disconnected the harness of the ethernet cord from the logic board and passed the small connector through from the inside to the outside of my house and reconnected... that saved me from drilling a large hole.Overall, I am very happy.  It's small and in my opinion doesn't look like a camera to people passing by.  The image is great and it feels well built.

I read reviews here prior and after receiving the unit and running it for a few days I have to conclude that most of the poor reviews are from absolute beginners to this type of technology who really have no business installing devices like these where traffic over a LAN can overwhelm their switches/routers without proper considerations in designing a network/LAN and understanding of this technology.  Everyone wants iClone installations for equipment that is designed to provide flexibility with a variety of equipment/software.  GET REAL.  If you want iSimpleton capability, go to your apple store and stop wasting everyone's time reviewing this equipment.  1080p even compressed will use plenty of bandwidth.  One negative I can see from this camera is the shipped firmware does have built-in accounts to the embedded web interface which you cannot remove.  These are likely used to push updated firmware to the units using the windows tools provided in an included CD.  This is still a backdoor if you open the camera up through your router to a WAN which is a key feature unless you are using something like Blue IRIS to control web access.  I have not sniffed the unit to see if it tries to broadcast its presence on a WANThe unit does ship with a static IP so you will need to understand basic networking to get a computer to talk to it so that you can change the IP.  I see one reviewer compared this unit to another brand with PTZ, Poor IR, and 480p resolution.  The unit was also $30 more.  I don't understand the logic in comparing a unit with reported poor additional features by reviewers with inferior resolution on top of it to this unit.  I'm seriously baffled at some folks logic or lack thereof.  This unit as advertised to be exactly what it is and you are paying for a higher quality lens/camera without the other accessories.  It's a semi-adjustable fixed dome.  This unit was also easy to tape the dome and spray paint the housing to match my home's siding. The backdoor is the only reason it didn't get 5 stars, that needs to be addressed, I don't need Dahua selling access to cameras sold abroad from China.  Fix that and you can have 5 stars.  Btw HD Security Store shipped it very promptly, so Kudos to them and I am trying another Dahua bullet with IR tomorrow.I believe it fulfills everything it was advertised to do.  The housing's construction materials are of good quality, the daylight image quality is superb for this price range, the lowlight is acceptable and as advertised.  These would make great cameras for indoor hallways in corners as well.

It took an entire day of fiddling to get the settings right. I was able to get it running satisfactorily in Blue Iris, but like another reviewer, I was unable to locate the settings to change the port from 37777. It didn't help that the camera was delivered with the native language set to Spanish.

I looked around on the web at different forums, youtube and some blogs and found good feedback on this camera (IPC-HDB3200C) and ordered one.  My intention was to build a system like I had with my analog DVR system, instead with just with a Network Video Recorder on a PC we no longer used.  What I liked about the camera was that it was one wire - a single CAT5 cable, while I did have to pull out my old coax cable and replace it with the CAT5, I was able to use my coax as a pull string for the new cable.  Then it was just a matter of putting on the CAT5 jack and plugging it into my trendnet POE switch.  I found I was able to configure everything from within the web UI, though if you want to view video through the web interface (such as during setup) you will need Internet Explorer, though you can still configure the camera if you don't install the ActiveX control.  I'll spare you all the functionality in the UI as there is a youtube video that goes through nearly all of the features, though my firmware was slightly newer / different than the one on the youtube video.  I got the camera all configured and then working with BlueIris, a $50 PC based software application which worked perfectly to store all the video (added a 2TB drive) and providing me a method to access recorded content and to also access live video via my Android phone and my wife's iPhone.  I won't kid you - setting up IP cameras does require some technical understanding that the average person might not have (terminating CAT5 cables if you pull your own, networking with POE, software configuration, RTSP configuration) - though this would apply to all IP cameras as it is just part of the process.  So, don't think this (or any IP cam) is just a drop in solution, you'll need to know your stuff.  I just finished purchasing another six cameras for the rest of the house.  A hint here - though my cameras came with 3.6mm lenses, you can find additional \"mega pixel board\" lenses as another reviewer mentioned on the web and I was able to get some tighter areas (FOV) with even more clarity (front and back doors and next to the side of the house.)  So far so good, they have worked great and even considering they don't have IR (I didn't want to have to deal with all the extra wiring/power issues), low light resolution is pretty good - I can clearly see better through these cameras at night than I can with my own naked eye at night.", "Date": "March 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "vtjcole", "ReviewID": "RL8AGT5J9QAPN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome camera.

Ultimately, my POE switch was not properly working which was causing the problem but we would have arrived at that conclusion much quicker if the help from Dahua worked to rule out on potential problem at a time instead of declaring it was working properly from the get go.Did get it working but unless you have a large screen tv that you are using to view this camera on, the 1080p HD does not give you anymore clarity then a 720P camera.  Does not pan or tilt but does have a large area of vision, so there are limited area's where you want to set it up.  I have it included in my Synology Surveillance system and after a few tweaks it worked nicely with the software but again has limitations (no night vision, no pan and tilt).For the money I think I will stick with the Agasio A622W, which is about $10 cheaper and has the night vision, pan and tilt capabilities and is much  easier to set up.  You do have to provide power to the Agasio but I am willing to live with that.", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "average ip cam", "Author": "media", "ReviewID": "R318D9Q6294V70", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "video was not that 1080P quality...the flow of video is not smooth...still images is ok...most important no product assistance service available from dahua...doesn't support all brands of micro sd card...", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$154.89", "Features": "1/3\" 3Megapixel progressive scan Exmor CMOS\nH.264 & MJPEG dual-stream encoding\n3.6mm fixed lens (2.8mm is optional)\nMicro SD memory, IP66, IK10, PoE", "Name": "Dahua 3M Megapixel 1080P HD Outdoor IP Dome Network Security Surveillance CCTV Camera PoE Power Over Ethernet Weatherproof Vandalproof", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31r3FTHSIUL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00HG10XHQ"}}
