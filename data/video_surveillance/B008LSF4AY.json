I had to open it up to get the part that broke off during shipping and it is very light weight, minimal support for the hard drive and overall a product of a very low price.  I bought this one from a merchant on Amazon and he shipped it in the retail packaging.  Once informed about it I did receive my refund immediatly after return.I would suggest springing for more money for such an important device.  If you are buying a DVR for security camera's, you would want to rely on it.
