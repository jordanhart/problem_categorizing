The picture quality is better than some of the 700 TV lines cameras I have tried at twice the price. Night vision is a little grainy but can see well out to 50'. Don't mount them to high off the ground, between 3' and 10' works the best. I think sealing the small screw heads and wire with a water proof grease will help them last longer. Buying 4 more at this price is a must for me.", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great cameras", "Author": "Chris W Grant", "ReviewID": "RKVI6QVCKA7YX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought these cameras to add onto my existing systems.
