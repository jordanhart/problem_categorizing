Instead, they have an RJ12 connection (like a 6-pin telephone cord), so you will most likely have to purchase the Revo RJ12 to BNC/DC adapters for another $10 each.  I haven't tested the cameras yet, since I have to wait for these adapters to arrive, so I can't say how well the cameras themselves work at this time.", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product", "Author": "manish j bhakta", "ReviewID": "R20KE8OTHM47SS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great cameras for th price.
