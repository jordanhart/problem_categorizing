It was very easy to set up.... I am not a techie and I was able to figure it out. I needed to call revo for some help setting up the iPhone to watch,  waited 40 minutes, but the person who helped spoke English well and was very knowledgable. I love the emails that are sent, with a picture, when the motion detector is set off. I didn't give it 5 stars because the system isn't wireless...... There are tons if visible wires in my house.", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent product", "Author": "George", "ReviewID": "R6KSSQFMKYTSU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The product is excellent at a very competitive price.
