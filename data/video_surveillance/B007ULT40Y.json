Replacing the computer with this DVR was essentially \"plug and play.\"  As soon as power was applied it recognized the eight cameras and immediately displayed video.It still requires one to customize their preferences and this takes a couple of hours plus subsequent \"fine tuning\" to obtain the desired results.  For example, adjusting the motion detecting areas and motion sensitivity because bushes blowing in the wind will activate the recording.The manual is adequate but it is very generic to all of their products but this wasn't a big deal.I spoke to tech support twice and they were helpful and answered by questions.It already paid off because someone hit our security gate resulting in more than $1,000 in damages and this person has been identified and has written a check for the damages.This DVR is reasonably priced and I recommend it.", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$349.99", "Features": "View anytime, anywhere with remote viewing via internet, smartphone, and tablet\nRecord over 2 years' worth of footage on the included 500 GB hard drive\nChoose motion-activated recording or H.264 compression to maximize storage space", "Name": "DEFENDER 21013 SENTINEL 8-Channel Smart Security DVR", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31g4nv9qVIL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007ULT40Y"}}
