{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great little cheap mini-cam unit", "Author": "Donovan Vernon Borman", "ReviewID": "R29Z93LIXD57W3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I picked this unit after much research, for a home-made robot (class project). Here's the scoop:For the price, it's fantastic!Performance: Our best results, with a fresh battery, camera unit transmitted ~200' of open parking lot AND ~75' of industrial building w/ lots of flouro/wifi etc. with minimal interference. However, signal strength fell off with batt pwr. Unfortunately, we used a variety of 9Vs at various stages of use or I'd have a lifespan for you. Best guesstimate is minimum 30 minutes full strength from fresh batt.We also played around with it indoors, with the AC adapters on both units.Either way, you'll occasionally have to tweak the RX tuner for best reception if the camera is mobile, or the environment changes (body blocking the antenna of the Tx etc.) See that little knob by the Rx unit's antenna? That's the tuning knob.How does it work?Camera unit powered by AC adapter, or 9V battery (short life as expected) sends audio & video to receiver unit.Receiver unit->RCA cables->TV/VCR/whatever (I used an old portable TV/VCR combo from a junk sale). No \"Wifi\" here. If this thing had night-vision AND digital tuning it'd have 6 out of 5 stars. Speaking of IR, this camera will detect IR like most digi-cameras.  The only test I managed to do before it's demise* was to point a TV remote at it in a sealed darkroom, and it did register the IR LED.*The TX unit was smoke-checked by an idiot miswiring an improvised AC adapter after we lost the first one, but I'm definitely getting another.", "Date": "July 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good value for a basic system", "Author": "Ron F. \"ronf528\"", "ReviewID": "RZ1NKNJVLLBF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this setup for birding. Installation was a breeze. One bit of confusion was the manual which stated the power adapters for the camera and transmitter should not be interchanged and could damage the equipment if hooked up wrong; however, the adapters were identical.  I installed everything and had it working in less than 10 minutes.  There is some interference as others have pointed out, i.e., occasional lines and jitters, but all in all a very good color picture for the price.  I do not see a problem with low light conditions - I have a robin who built a nest under my deck, and was hoping to watch the babies hatch.  Today they did within half an hour of my installation of the camera.  The camera is tucked up underneath the joists and there is no direct sunlight, yet the picture is clear and bright. This may not hold true for dusk, but for use in normal daylight, I'd highly recommend this system if you're on a tight budget.  I couldn't ask for more considering cost/performance ratio.", "Date": "May 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Value! If you have no RF interference and dial it in.", "Author": "jetfxr \"jet\"", "ReviewID": "R1TV3EAV9ZU6XE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an overall great value once you understand a few things.This device is susceptible to RF noise.  Its either gonna work, or you have to much RF noise and it will not work.The camera has a series 2 dip switches which give you which give you 4 frequency ranges to play with.  The base has a tuning knob to fine tune each setting of the dip switch.When you initially plug this thing in IT PROBALY WILL NOT WORK.  Play with the dip switches on the back of the camera in all positions and fine tune on the receiver dip switch each position.My intial setup all I did was plug and hope to play.  It didnt work, and I felt like I belonged in the 1 star camp.  I through it aside and said fegetaboutit...Fast forward a few weeks later I dug it back out noticed the dip switches on the camera and adjusted them. Fine tuned on the receiver side for each position until I found the one that worked best.  BAM, perfect picture!  Added it to my Kguard DVR setup and set to record.Then a week later bad horizontal lines rolling up and down while in live view. AARRGHH, whats going on?  Then I tried to think what changed in the last week with my RF enviornment.  I happened to add and XBOX 360 slim to my entertainment setup.  So I went over to the XBOX, unplugged it and BAM, perfect picture again.  Plugged it in , boom lines are back.So be aware that once you dial it in and you still have scrolling lines, its probaly the RF noise in your home.  Try unplugging items that generate RF noise one at a time (cordless phones, XBOX, wifi routers, microwaves while in use, etc.) to see whats killing your image, Its probaly not the camera.  For me I live with the lines.  They're not that bad.  Plus I love the fact I can add a camera anywhere by simply plugging it in.PS: The lens on the camera can be turned to focus.Pros:CheapVery smallWell builtGreat resolution and color for priceEasy to hideAudioEasily added to a Cheap Chinese CCTV DVR for a low cost additional cameraBattery operatedCons:No IR lightsVery susceptible to RF noise in the 2.4GHZ rangeXBOX 360 Slim interferes", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great video for the price", "Author": "Luvinhistory", "ReviewID": "RZ56UMW1HH81N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little camera works great for keeping an eye on things.  A word of advice, be sure to set the channel on the camera so as to not interfere with any wifi network you are running.  The switches are on the camera. two tiny white switches on the side of the camera,  then adjust the reciever to that channel with the adjustment knob on the top. Once that was don, all of my wireless stuff was happy and working well.", "Date": "May 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good alternative to expensive baby video monitors", "Author": "Kindle Customer", "ReviewID": "R2VTYNQ6RB8ZE2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We got this rather than spend $140+ on a baby monitor for our child.  We always swore we'd never get a video monitor as it seemed like an invasion of our child's privacy.  However, she is now 2 years and 3 months and we are in the process of transitioning from a crib to a bed, and we have quickly learned that we need to see what she's doing during nap times.  We thought we'd try this out.  Granted, it only broadcasts to one TV, but we mostly sit downstairs and fold laundry while the kiddo sleeps, so we just set the TV up (Picture in Picture) in our living room.Pros:- We were impressed with the small size of the camera.- Field of View - For the most part, it captures most of our child's room.  We have vaulted ceilings and placed the camera at the highest place (14 ft).  From here, we can point it down and capture most of the room (room measures 16 X 14).  If we had shorter ceilings, we probably wouldn't get a good areal shot.- It was easy to set up.  We had to buy a RF modulator since our TV has already used up all of the RCA inputs in the back.- The picture is mostly clear as is the audio.  There are a few interference issues (see the Cons section).  Our daughter's room is upstairs and the TV we attached the receiver to is directly downstairs.  In all, I'd say there's about 30 ft from transmitter to receiver.  It seems to do ok transmitting through the floor/ceiling.  I didn't test it to see how far I could go before the picture got bad.- Doesn't affect our home phone (5.4 GHz) nor our Wireless Internet (ATT Uverse - whatever band they use).  Cell phones didn't bother it either - even in WiFi mode.Cons:- This device does not like our microwave.  I'm unsure if they are on the same circuit, but when the microwave runs we get lots of interference.  This is a minor inconvenience though since we don't usually run the microwave for more than a few minutes.  We could probably try an AC interference adapter, but we don't want to spend the money on something that isn't that big of a deal for us.- The camera only tilts up and down.  The arm the camera sits on does allow you to twist the camera, but the picture twists with it.  What this means is that you can easily tilt up and down, but you can't go left to right when you're trying to set it up.  In order to get the camera to look slightly left, I had to twist the camera mount.  This means our picture isn't exactly level, but again, it doesn't bother us too much.- Battery life is pitiful.  I decided to try a 9 volt to see how long it would last.  It was a matter of hours before our picture started degrading.  Once I attached the AC adapter the fuzziness went away and the picture got much better.  Don't get this for it's battery operation option; be prepared to always use the AD adapter.In all, I'd recommend this.  At least try it before you spend $140 on video baby monitors.  Worst case scenario you return it and are out only the shipping.", "Date": "January 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Better than expected", "Author": "David F. Buff", "ReviewID": "R2LDJPVZVATPLN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little thing does a great job for anything you can think of. The range is decent as long as not many walls are in the way. Its very portable (strap it to your dog and see where he goes!). The nine volt battery will die fairly quickly if it is not a good one. If you are keeping it stationary, the adapter works great. The quality is good in good lighting and the audio is great too, you can tape it to your shirt and use it as a wireless mic if you want. Not the best out there but for the price, it can't be beat!", "Date": "February 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "It all depends what expectations you have...", "Author": "Rocket Scientist", "ReviewID": "R2T79FWD1J5PE2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Some people are in love with this camera, some hate it. It all depends on what you're expecting from this toy.Let me outline it's main parameters:Image quality: Quite nice, sure this is not a HD, but it has comparable image quality to my Panasonic VHS-C camcorder, made in 1995.Low light sensitivity: Not the night vision device, but low light sensitivity is OK. For example, way better than average webcam, or Kodak Zi8Immunity to interference: This is the weakest point of this system. Any wifi router or device will be your worst enemy. Interference is annoying - large bar moving along the screen, with clicking interference on sound. If you plan to place receiver at fixed position, it is easy to shield out from wifi interference - just place a half arc cut from beer can at side of antenna. Align it's position and distance for best results.You should note another thing - the transmitter circuitry is frequency dependent on antenna capacitance. In simple terms this means that, any new object near the transmitter antenna will cause it's frequency to shift a bit. So, place camera in such position, than no moving subjects will appear at 30cm or closer distance to antenna.Overall, our family likes this camera quite much. We've installed it at our patio, which is next to artifical pond, where we have ducks. So, now kids can see, what their ducks are doing, and are they hungry or not.Remember, this camera is NOT designed to be mounted outdoors. So you'll need some sealed enclosure, if you'll decide to mount it outdoors.", "Date": "May 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not Same As Pictured Product and Did Not Work Properly", "Author": "Richard Hall", "ReviewID": "RJ22WKVZ29VOT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to be used with a robotics project, so I really wasn't looking for anything with great audio and visual. I just wanted something that was okay.First, I immediately noticed the product was not the same as that pictured on Amazon. There was no camera stand for the pinhole camera. But I would be okay with that if the camera worked.Also, the instructions say that there is a 9V 500mA AC adapter for the receiver and a 9V 200mA AC adapter for the camera. Instead there were 2 identical 500mA adapters. When I plugged one into the camera, both the camera and the adapter plug got very hot to the touch. Again I'd probably be okay with this if the camera worked.Finally, the camera just didn't work properly. There is a tuner knob for tuning in the camera on the TV. Just as I started to get a very weak picture, the tuner hit its limit and you couldn't turn the knob any further. The resulting picture was all scrambled and jumpy with very crackly audio. And that was only when the camera and receiver were in the same room. Move the camera 10 feet away to another room in the house and there is no signal at all.The best thing about this purchase is how easy it is to return to Amazon.", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great wireless camera.", "Author": "Brian Newberry \"Say something about yourself!\"", "ReviewID": "R11WO3L924SIFQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent camera (sound mic too!)  Great value.  Uses those little red, white & yellow \"RCA\" cables compatable with most TVs, DVD players & home entertainment ctrs.The camera itself is TEENY TINY.  If you ever played dice (\"craps\") - imagine a camera as small as one single die!I use it on my front porch because we don't have a peep-hole on our front door.PROBLEMS:  (though not deal-breakers)1.  The first model I received didn't work.  I returned it, and the merchant exchanged it for better one which did work!  Problem solved.2.  Can it really be powered by either plugging it into a wall, OR by using a 9-volt battery.  Well, \"NO\".  Regrettably, the battery doesn't work (I tried 3 different batteries; none worked).  So I just used an extention cord - problem solved.This is the least expensive wireless camera I could find and it works great!I live in Palm Springs, California (extreme desert temps range from 35'f (winter pre-dawn mornings), all the way upto 119'f (summer days about 5:pm)) and despite its \"INDOOR\" Label - this little dynamo has been on my OUTDOOR porch, and working reliably & fine for over 2 years/ no problems!)I'm extremely pleased with this wireless camera!", "Date": "January 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wireless monitoring device works well", "Author": "Sudarshan Karkada", "ReviewID": "R343WU3ZT3JP75", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Technically it works very well (much better than I expected), but video quality is poor.I needed a inconspicuous video camera with the ability to record, that is easy to setup, inexpensive, and little or no maintenance. I don't need the ability for real-time monitoring. I don't need to watch anything over the Internet. All I need is the ability to go back and see what happened at a certain time.How I have setup this product:1. I have placed the camera in a place and position to capture the maximum activity. Camera clamp can be rotated in two axes, but the third axis is rigid. I think they should redesign the clamp/fixture such that there is complete freedom to adjust the camera.2. I have placed the receiver about 10' away such that both antennae are in line.3. Connected the receiver via Dazzle video converter to a computer.4. Computer is kept always on constantly recording the video.Issues with the above setup: (1) I have to change the video file about once a day and delete old files periodically (2) only I know how to manage the whole setup - too much technology for the family (3) captured digital video size (width and height) is small and quality is poor.Alternative setup: Instead of connecting the receiver to a computer, I tried connecting it to an old VCR. Much simple to operate. I have used 6-hour VHS tapes. With this setup, picture size is as big as the TV, picture quality is abysmal. Low tech and family can manage the setup. More maintenance in that the tape should be changed every 6 hours.I am currently satisfied with the setup. Happy with the product - it does what I need and I didn't have to pay a lot. However, I am still looking for a product similar to this, but has better camera.", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Comfort!!", "Author": "B.

identical to the LYD system that sells for $10-$15 more.  I have only tested this camera out for about an hour or so with a distance of about 40 feet and 2 walls in between.  Works great with some light static.  You MUST adjust by testing each channel on the camera first then adjusting the dial on receiver to obtain a good signal.  I have not tested the camera on a 9v battery due to the fact of it draining too fast, but I did order a MPD (Memory Protection Device) from DigiKey.com.  The MPD holds 6-AA batteries in series with 9v snaps on one end to replace the 9v, in doing this you obtain 9 volts (1.5 volts for each AA times 6) but with a whole lot more capacity, thus making the camera last longer with good signal strength.  The people on here that are giving bad reviews are not properly tuning, might be exceeding the distance from the receiver, or just plain dumb and expect perfect quality for the price.  So take your time and use common sense.The reason I purchased this spy camera is to catch my crackhead neighbor stealing my packages.

The package contained all the equipment including the 9volt battery adapter. all in all im very pleased with this purchase, well see how long the unit lasts :)Update.  The 9 volt adapter that's included is kinda cheap and the wire frayed on mine so i went to radio shack and got a new 9 volt clip.works great just be careful not to break the wires.

At night with a lamp in the living room, there is a picture, but it is difficult to distinguish facial features.  You do have to tune the receiver to get a picture.  Tuning is very touchy.  For most of the tuning range there is no video signal.  Once you find the video signal, my experience was that it was either perfect or not viewable at all.  There is no power switch on the receiver or the camera.  When they are plugged in, they are on.  There is a a red LED power indicator on the receiver, no indicator on the camera.Audio is 1-channel and the quality is average.  You need to be within about 5-10 feet to hear a normal conversation.There is no mount for the camera I received, so it didn't match the picture.  You will need to be duct-tape savvy or create some sort mount for this particular camera.  The box the camera came in has several pictures of cameras, none of which were the product inside the box.  The box has 23 check-boxes printed on it for what I think are 9 different camera models listed along with some other device types and specification options (power supplies, transmitters, receivers, 2.4G/NTSC/PAL).The AC adapters that came with the unit are identical for the camera and the receiver.  They both have a 3-foot cord that attaches to the wall wart.  I find this to be too short for placing the camera anywhere and will look at a battery option.  The receiver says it will accept 9-12V for DC input.  The fine Chinese documentation (although better than some I have seen) lists the camera input as 8V.Given the exquisite Chinese craftsmanship, if you are looking for a high-quality camera, I would recommend you keep looking.  If you just need something to show you what is going on outside with an audio feed, this will work...as long as the camera is close to an outlet and you have your home-made mount available.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good camera for inexpensive price", "Author": "Warbird Buff", "ReviewID": "R2ULZDKWETGVGM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I shopped and researched the market before deciding on this mini camera.  If your shopping around, there are other brands in the marketplace that look suspiciously like this one for $99.95 and $89.95.  They are all made in China.I purchased this light-weight, portable, mini, wireless camera to mount on an N scale model railroad flatcar.  Portable power supply is furnished by a 9 volt NiMh 250 mAh (rechargable) battery I purchased on Amazon.  The battery and inexpensive charger brand name is \"Tenergy\".  It also comes with an AC cord to connect with house power.The flatcar is pushed by a locomotive and the picture is transmitted through an inexpensive ($99.95) LCD TV.  The viewer is transported through the model railroad layout as if they were riding on the actual train.  This feature added another realistic dimension to the hobby.  Small N scale becomes large life-like on the screen.  The picture quality is ever-so-slightly blurred but clear enough to enjoy the realism.  When riding on a full-size train and looking out the window, the scenery and buildings are also similarly blurred; therefore, scale realism is assured.This camera uses lots of power and will deplete a 9 volt alkaline battery in thirty minutes.  A fully charged 9 volt NiMh 250 mAh battery lasts for one hour and eight minutes.  It obviously pays to use a rechargable battery.  I discovered that the depleted alkaline battery had enough life remaining to run a flashing LED light which is installed as an airport rotating beacon (A seasoned hobbyist never throws anything away) on my layout.

I've seen similar cameras on hobby websites go for around $80. This $26 camera I'm sure is no where near that $80 camera, but it's good enough to start off with. It does not like walls in the least. One sheetrock wall and the signal is gone, forget four or five, or through a brick wall. Another thing it does not like is bouncing. I bought this to put on RC cars, but as soon as the car hits a bump, the picture starts cutting out. And if the car goes behind a wall, you're f*****. The receiver comes with a tuning knob which is crazy sensitive. Just a little bit of a tweak can send the whole picture wonky. When it does work, which is when they're within about 20ft of each other, the picture's pretty good, about the quality of an old VHS camcorder with similar audio characteristics, which is damn surprising considering the signal's moving through the air.Long story short, it's a poorly made Chinese wannabe product.

The video itself was captured by a PC capture card connected directly to the included camera receiver.  The video itself hasn't been altered in any shape or form.= SHORT REVIEW = Configured correctly, this camera will transmit an audio and video signal that is actually pretty good for the size and price of the unit.  Interference from Wi-Fi networks and other things can cause the A/V signal to crap out, however.  The camera can be mounted outdoors as long as it has proper housing or protection from the elements.= LONG REVIEW = I purchased two camera sets off of Amazon, first one purchased June of 2011 and the second one purchased February of 2013.  Both kits came with one wireless camera, one receiver, two AC adapters, one 9V battery adapter, and one composite A/V video cable. Setting up the system is very simple.  Just plug in the two adapters, hook the receiver up to your television, and power on the receiver and camera.  Slowly turn the silver knob on the receiver and you'll see the video signal transmitted by the camera. The farther away the camera is from the receiver, the crappier the audio and video signal will become.  Audio is the first thing to go south; you'll hear crackling and static but the video signal usually isn't affected.  Move the camera even farther away and the video signal will simply turn to snow.  Microwave ovens and Wi-Fi networks also affect signal quality, regardless of distance. Video quality is pretty impressive for the size and price of the camera.  The video signal produced is very similar to those video camcorders from the 90s and 2000s.  The FOV on this camera is pretty narrow, however, which means that it won't be able to capture large areas effectively.  Also, the camera will NOT work effectively at night; all you'll see is just a dark screen.  To change focus, twist the lens on the front of the camera; twist it out for macro focus and visa versa. Audio quality is also pretty impressive for the size and price of the unit.  With this camera, you can clearly listen to conversations, barking dogs, chirping birds, and other ambient sounds.  Don't expect audiophile quality though.  Unfortunately, audio is the most susceptible to random interference.= GETTING THE MOST OUT OF THIS PRODUCT = Most wireless devices inside your home run on the 2.4 GHz band.  That means that if not configured properly, this camera will interfere with those devices, and those devices will interfere with the camera.  Most notable is a Wi-Fi network. If both your camera and router operate on the same relative frequencies, then you'll have a bunch of problems.  To your digital 2.4 GHz devices, the camera is just a source of random interference, which causes slower connection speeds and difficulty connecting to the Internet.  To your camera receiver, those [other] devices will interfere with the camera signal, causing lots of static and choppy video.  In the end, nothing wins, and you'll be tearing your hair out wondering what's causing all of this to happen. On the back of the camera, there are two small dipswitches.  Those switches control the frequency at which the camera transmits.  Using a sewing needle, you can move the switches around, changing the transmit frequency of the camera.  This is useful if you have two or more of these cameras operating at the same time.  To prevent interference with your Wi-Fi network, try operating the wireless camera at the frequency furthest away from whichever one your router is running at. Even after configuring your camera and Wi-Fi network, you'll still receive random interference.  Your microwave oven causes so much interference that the camera won't be viewable while the oven is operating.  Bluetooth devices also cause a lot of interference.  Neighboring Wi-Fi networks will also cause interference.= IMPORTANT ISSUE ABOUT PRIVACY = Before you purchase this product, just be aware that your neighbors WILL be able to view your camera IF they have a receiver similar to the one included in this kit.  The camera transmits an analogue signal, meaning there is NO encryption of any type.  If you don't want to be spied and listened upon, then don't mount this camera in a sensitive area of your house.= IN CONCLUSION = Even with its problems with interference and privacy, I will still recommend this product.  You can't beat the price or size of the unit and still expect the same quality of video and audio.", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "100% JUNK", "Author": "LawnCarePlus", "ReviewID": "R3NUQQG7J33KBR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This product is 100% JUNK.

I unplugged the power from the camera, plugged it back in, touched the camera wire to the receiver's antenna, then it homed in and worked perfectly.  60-80 feet away, in a WIFI-heavy environment and going through three walls, the video was crystal clear, as was the audio when powered via the a/c adapter.  The camera's image is very sharp and robust.  Even at close range to an object the video/audio was astoundingly clear.  This did not come with any type of mounting base, so the pictured item is wrong.Next, I used the 9V battery adapter.  Range was reduced to about 40-50 feet going through two walls, and clear reception was very hard to maintain.  It maintained a slightly grainy picture, but absolute sharpness was not sustainable under battery power.This exceeded my expectations, given the price.  The real test will be if it works in an elevator, because I'm trying to find out who's spitting on the elevator walls in our 4-story apartment building.  I will update later with the results.  BTW, this camera has no exterior dip switches.  I wonder if I would have to remove the two screws on the camera to access them.  Since it works, I won't bother looking into that.Update:  worked very well in the elevator to find our litterbug.  The signal randomly broke up between floors, but always reacquired the signal once the elevator stopped on a floor.  I've tried a few other, more expensive mini wifi cams, and they sucked and couldn't even acquire a signal once the cam was placed in the elevator.

If you are smart enough to hide the cord well it works pretty well.The Ugly- The signal takes a little tuning to get to the right frequency and for a perfect no distortion image, it needs to be fine tuned about every couple hours.

The box I was sent was titled (Wireless Receiver).Next the ad shows a pic of the power cables, A/V cables and 9 volt battery clip.  I was again disappointed when I learned the box I was sent didn't include the battery clip.I can't give a review of how the camera worked, because it appears I was sent a different receiver and camera.Its possible the seller I ordered it from Amazing Tech Depot had sent me an older model of the receiver and camera.

The receiver unit is small as well, about the size of a pack of cigarettes (a little bigger) and it receives audio and video via 2.4ghhz signal.  It has an old fashioned knob style tuning which is really cool i think.  You will get interference from internet routers and other 2.4 ghz wireless devices.  This camera does not have night vision so you cant see anything at night with it.  You can buy LED illuminators if need be.I plugged this thing into my front door area and i can see halfway down the block, i can clearly see people on the sidewalk and make and model of cars drving down my street.  yeah this wont look great when viewed on your 52\" LCD TV, but for home security on the cheap, this can't be beat.  I'm buying 4 more this week i love them so much...In the video, you can hear the audio and see the slight interference in the video due to my router.  The camera is looking through my metal screen door and you can still see things clearly.  The further the camera is from the base unit the worse this gets.  In the video the distance from the cam to the base unit is about 10 feet.  but i put this camera at my neighbors house to test distance and i can clearly see the camera, even with interference, so i'm SUPER please with this little camera.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Caught in the act!!", "Author": "California", "ReviewID": "R17F976R8K689M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is grate!

Unless you have a rechargeable 9V battery and are willing to recharge it every day, OR can afford to use a new disposable 9V EVERY DAY and don't care about the environment; then battery power is not an option, so plan on plugging it in to the wall socket or using a solar panel to power it.

Francis \"radioflyer6\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZO3PGWNSL8MF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The camera is very small - a 3/4\" cube - but it is permanently attached to a mount.  It has a small cord that can be used to plug into the 9 volt battery connector or a power supply.  One of each is included, so you can decide whether you want the camera to be on batteries or the receiver.The receiver is a lightweight box - weighs less than the camera and mount - with a standard RCA video and mono audio connection.  There is a light that shows power (no status on the camera) and a knob that allows you to - gently - tune in the video signal like an old style radio.In testing, my reception without obstacles was about 30 feet, less with walls in the way.  There was a lot of interference and loss of sync.  This probably would have been better with an old TV; before loss-of-signal turned to static rather than just turning the screen blue.  Even when I had the camera in a static position, I found I had to frequently fine tune to keep the picture halfway stable.I had planned to test this as a \"doorbell cam\", but I ended up just attaching it to my son's R/C car and we had fun looking around the house - fuzzy, blinking picture and all - and imagined we were driving one of the rovers on Mars.", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Couldn't have asked for better service!", "Author": "hogwildmike", "ReviewID": "RV0Z7IOQKRAVO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I gotta say, I am extremely impressed with not just the product itself... but I'm extremely impressed with the incredibly quick shipping!  I received my order after 4 days of ordering!  Now thats what I call service!!As for the product itself, works better than I thought it would.  Camera has excellent picture quality and is extremely easy to install/setup.The only complaint that I DO HAVE about this particular product.. is the 'EASYCAP 2.0' software that came with the EasyCap USB recorder.. which I also ordered along with the security camera.  The cd that comes with the USB EASYCAP 2.0 - well, to put it nicely.. the cd is absolutely BLANK.  There is ABSOLUTELY NO DATA on the disc.  I know this for a fact because I know what I'm doing whenever it comes to electronics.. especially computers.. as I have several Microsoft certificates under my belt.Other than that... everything else is great!  Camera works way better than I figured it would.. excellent picture on the screen.. just an overall great product considering its low price.If your on a tight budget like I am currently on.. this is absolutely, by far, the best 'BANG FOR YOUR BUCK' in my opinion!

It does what I wanted it to do.  Sometimes there will be a few lines on the screen when I have it hooked to my TV, but that is only when I get betweeen the camera and receiver.  It was easy to install right out of the box.  The color is good and the sound is good and it has a good picture over all.  I held the camera towards the parking lot from my 12th floor apartment and could see the parking lot very good and could see everything far in the distance.  This is a great product.  When I have my curtains shut you can't see the picture as good as when they are open or when I have a light on so it needs a little light for the picture, but this is expected.  I use the camera to film the door of my apartment.  I just turn it on and then put a tape in the VCR (anybody use a VCR anymore) that is built into my TV and set it to record.  When I come home I turn the camera off and rewind the tape and then fast foward through it and that way can tell if anybody been in my apartment when I was gone.  This little camera and receiver works good and I would say if you have a use for it go ahead and get it.  I believe you will be very satisfied.  I give it 4 stars just because of the reception when you walk betweeen the camera and receiver, but I have it set where I don't walk between them.  Haven't tried using it with the camera in one room and the receiver in another so I don't know how that works, but I read reviews before buying it and those people said it works good when you do.  I like it and think you will too if you get it.  I would also buy more products from Amazon because I got it when they said it would arrive and was able to track the product while it was being shipped.  Great product and a great company.  If you are thinking about getting this little camera and receiver I would say, go fo it.  I forgot.  When I got the camera I first hooked it to the peephole in my door and was able to see what was on the other side of the door.  This worked very good.  Could see it on the TV better than when I just look through the peephole with my eye.Terry", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great for the Money", "Author": "JT", "ReviewID": "RJ1FNVFJY3YBH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this product and it's not bad for the money. The camera and transmitter unit is smaller than I expected it to be and it's great that it can be powered by AC or 9v battery. The joints are rivets so they might wear out after a few uses. Antenna is bendable for flexible mounting/installation. There is exposed metal between the connector of the AC adapter and the connector on the camera unit that may shock you if you use the adapter. Tuning isn't that big of a deal, but this camera took my wireless network down. Overall, this camera is a good buy for the money.

If you're using this somewhere that you also want to use a 2.4 Ghz wireless internet network, do your homework first.  Use a different system (either 900 Mhz or 5.8 Ghz) that won't ruin your wireless internet network.  They should put a disclaimer on it, hence my low rating.

So, I purchased the camera, without the knowledge of anyone else, since I know that I wasn't taking the money.  Placed it in such a way that it was nearly impossible to see it and then started my surveillance.  First, I gave the kids their allowance and told them to put it in their banks.  I did this just before the babysitter left for the day.  Monitored it for nearly a week and got nothing.  Again, allowance day, I gave the money and told them to put it in their banks and monitored.  2 days later, I caught the babysitter taking money out of each of the banks.  When I confronted her about it, she said she didn't do it.  When I showed her the video, she told me that I had no right to do that to her.

I'd guess the internal electronics are not very robust and susceptible to fluctuations in power supply voltage as caused by connecting & disconnecting power. Too bad.

Although this camera is not intended for use outside, it works great, just try to protect it from extreme heat, rain and snow. The tuner receiver requires you to use the volume like knob control to find the signal and its very sensitive and you could easily pass your cameras signal plus I'm not sure just how secure your signal is against being pirated by other tuners. All in all this is a great very inexpensive way to monitor your garage, parking lot or outside porch, not for private recording inside because of security concerns.

Considering that was over 10+ year old technology I thought the camera I was buying today would be at least as good as that. I was mistaken.This camera sets up and gets running easy enough and with some tuning you do get a picture. Note if not tuned properly there is absolutely no image at all. You have to be pretty precise in the tuning to get a clear image. All the pieces necessary are in the box, the camera, receiver, audio/video cable, battery adapter, tiny screws if you want to screw the camera down. I was disappointed I cold not rotate the camera on the stand so it could be wall mounted. It looks like it may be able to be ceiling mounted but I didn't try for sure.The real letdown however was in the camera itself. First the field-of-view of the camera was a real let down. Again my experience with small cameras like this they always had a pretty decent FOV. (You could see more of a scene like you were standing further back). This camera was giving me a significantly narrower FOV then the one I was trying to replace.And the biggest problem with this camera didn't get noticed until that night. This camera has TERRIBLE ability to record in the dark- honestly the WORST I have ever seen EVER in any camera- like unbelievably bad night vision. I have a city streetlight in front of my house and it was always plenty for my old camera to take decent video after dark. This camera literally gave me just a black screen. The only reason I knew it was working was when the occasional car passed with headlights on- then I could see just the 2 \"dots\" from the lights passing and nothing else. This camera is totally useless outside at night. Worse still I was up early this morning, around 5:30 AM, there was enough sun out to be considered \"dawn\" - you could see out the window without much issue... but then I looked at the signal from this camera- exactly as dark and black as it had been in the middle of the night. I didn't get a picture on the camera for another good hour until the sun was significantly stronger.The FOV and the lack of any picture in the \"dark\" is my main reason for the low review.Also as was pointed out by another reviewer the instruction manual has a warning telling you the A/C Adapters are NOT interchangeable and using the wrong one with the camera vs. the receiver would be bad- but the A/C Adapters included are identical, same model, 8-volt, 500-mA adapters.UPDATE: Today when moving the camera to the other side of the house (which by the way gives a terrible picture, lots of interference) we accidentally \"tuned\" into a neighbor about 6 houses away and on the other side of the street who must have a similar system. We were able to see the image off their camera! They must have a better camera though because I can't get a picture that clear from even 40' away let alone the 200'+ their signal must be traveling.
