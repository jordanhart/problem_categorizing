{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Plot watcher pro is big improvement", "Author": "S. Butler", "ReviewID": "R2S1A1784QWHKN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The pro is a good product. I have a lot of infrared game cameras, but I bought this to observe large food plots. A deer has to cross within 30 feet or so of an infrared camera but the pro takes a shot of entire plot every 5 seconds so you pick up deer in the whole plot. The battery life on the pro is great. It's been out 6 weeks on daytime only every 5 seconds and battery meter shows about 55%.I have a 32GB sd card that will hold at least 3 weeks of images. It takes about 7 minutes per day to watch the video on 5x speed looking for deer, so it takes a while to review a few weeks of data. But it sure has told me a lot of good info. Image quality is good and the software has a zoom feature.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Works as advertised", "Author": "D. Stux \"stooxie\"", "ReviewID": "R16BD1KE3676IC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera does everything it claims to do, and does it well. I don't need an infra-red trigger camera to tell me when a 10 point buck is out at 3 am. I need a camera to watch the places I hunt and tell me when the deer are there during daylight, dawn and dusk. The interface is really easy to use, the \"GameFinder\" software works surprisingly well (both Mac and PC) and the device works with very large SDHC cards. I am using a 32GB class 10 and so far so good. I could easily have 3 or 4 of these set up around the backyards that I hunt to let me know when and where I need to be.UPDATEThis camera has already prove itself invaluable! I tied it to a tree facing an area that supposedly had deer \"all the time\" according to the residents. Well, they are, but not at the time I would have thought. The camera showed that at 2:38pm, on the nose, almost daily 4-5 deer walked by and grazed. Brilliant, I am getting a second one of these.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Owner of original plot watcher...", "Author": "justinsmomma", "ReviewID": "R1LGYV4EAZN8UG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We were disappointed with the battery life of the original plot watcher, but loved the concept.

I hunt public hunting lands and can not bait deer. I see alot of buck tracks but can never seem to guess the right spot for my trail cameras. I can't put them directly on the trails because of thieves. After one of my trail camers was stolen last week, I decided to give \"Day 6 Plotwatcher Pro HD\" a try. Five hours after putting out my Plotwatcher Pro, I had a little 4 point buck walking around the area. He returned 4 hours later at sunset and walked around for 10 minutes. I would have never seen him on my trail cameras. I have 2 trail cameras for sale if anyone wants them.

Not for taking pictures of wildlife.  The resolution is not on par with your Iphone as one person suggested...but try fitting a picture taken every second , 12 hours a day, for several weeks on your phone.  Several 1 star ratings completely missed the point of this camera let me highlight the upsides....1) Its the only camera I found that will take constant pictures regardless of motion trigger.  There is no motion capture so you get picture coverage as wide as a football field and just as deep.  You will see everything in that view, and things closer up you will get pretty good pics.  The reviewer that was annoyed that you could not tell between a buck and a doe was referring to pics that are a good distance away.  Other motion triggered cams would never even picked it up in the first place.2) Doubles as a security camera.  Can be used as a security cam during the off season.  I have had a decoy stolen so I was just as concerned about capturing thieves and trespassersWith pics at a rate up to 1 a second there is no way you will miss any action.  There is something that makes me feel better when  I have confirmed video that no one has been bothering the hunting site.3) Battery life is incredible!  I have used this camera for two months at a time and it still had 60% battery life.  I am away from the property for weeks at a time so this is a must.  And only 8 AA batteries.  No lugging around one of those ridiculous huge batteries that other cams require.4) Software does work well for detecting movement.  Very simple to use. Without this it would take hours to go through a week of footage.5) Simple to use.  The only thing you need the lcd screen is for setting up the shot.Cons or improvements:1) Camera needs to be set up in a proper location.  I recommend trying a few spots prior to hunting season.  The sunrise or sunset, along with wind blowing leaves can drastically effect the search of the sofware for movement.  You will know what I mean after trying different places.  This can be minimized by good placement. Dont put it in line with the sunrise or sunset.  A better lens  filter, liked a polarized lens might improve it.2) LCD does not preview images except for setting up.  It would have been nice to review the pics while I was hunting.  An android ap with software would be awesome so you could swap the cards and review out in the field.  Without a motion capture ap you would need to sort through a crazy amount of pics.3) No night mode, not good at low light pics.  It is what it is.  I don't care what the deer are doing at night.  This could be a must for people looking for Yeti...4) Price is high at $200+.  But hunting is not something most people do to save money.  I have not seen any other camera that does what this cam does for the same money though....", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unbelievabe Camera", "Author": "FatFatallThat", "ReviewID": "R3BVFIRDCI6P8O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered 1 of these Camera in October and Another in November.

The pro's --- battery life with regular energizer batteries is awesome; the range or FOV is easily 150 yards long and 75 yards wide; the factory default settings are perfect (5sec picture intervals; auto dusk/dawn activation); 16gb memory card with 5sec pic intervals will last you 10 days; quality product; adjusting setting is very easy.Accessories to consider --- camlock security box (it fits perfectly and protects camera from the elements); masterlock Cable to safely secure to the tree;  climbing tree sticks to get the camera a good 15 feet off the ground so you can pattern activity in a much larger area", "Date": "November 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Plotwatcher Pro has a quality issue with LCD screen", "Author": "Leonard Gamberg", "ReviewID": "R1Y10WXVSA0KU0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have a Plotwatcher pro that i bought last October (2012).

I have had my plotwatcher for 10 months, after being out for 1 week this year the LCD screen went white and stopped working.  I contacted Plotwatcher about a warranty repair but am out of luck as I no longer have my receipt.  The CS rep stated that this has been a problem with this camera and in fact they are back logged on repairs waiting for new LCD screens to come in to repair what has already been sent back and that he has a list of people to contact to send in their cameras once they have screens in stock.  My repair will cost $50.00 as I can't find my receipt 10 months later.  In my opinion poor customer service for a known issue with a product.

Here are some unique videos I have recorded that would have been completely missed by a triggered camera.Six racked bucks walking single file at more than 60 feet distance. Group of bucks walking across a pasture more than 80 feet. Twenty four deer feeding on pea patch at a distance where a triggered camera would have never been fired. Camera set up on trail and recording buck movement 20 or more yards off the trail. Again triggered camera would have missed this.

Used a 32GB card with it and set it up for dawn to dusk recording with a picture interval set to 2 sec.The batteries last about 5-6 weeks with the picture interval set to 1 picture/sec, or 1 picture every 2 seconds. The files it would record came in at over 2.4GB per day in most instances.The Macintosh Gamefinder software would load and play any file that was sized less than 2.4GB.  Any file above this sizewould place a tiny dot in the upper left corner of the Gamefinders window.  That would be all it would show.Moving the files to a windows computer allowed the time lapse movies to play.  So if you have a Macintosh andwish to record at faster intervals, you will have a problem.  I'd contacted Day6 about this, and they claimed it had been fixed.Their downloads/support page indicates that the software for the Macintosh is at version 1.5.  However, when you perform a get infoon the application, it indicates it's at version 1.0.  The date stamp is Sept 6, 2011, but it's hard to figure if that means they updatedthe app to version 1.5, and forgot to update the version being reported to get info.  Perhaps a link at their web site is queueing the older softwarefor download.  They were responsive the first couple of times I'd contacted them, but have ignored my further efforts to contact them.  It might be that thissituation does not occur often enough to expend the effort to fix the mac gamefinder software to display files larger than 2.4GB.I was using this camera for surveillance and it was useful in catching people driving onto our property, but the higher capture rate wasneeded due to how fast thieves work.  For most purposes this is one of the best systems I've used.  But if you only have access to a Macintosh, then keep the pictures  being captured to onceevery 5 seconds or more.  That should keep the file size under 2.4GB where displaying the pictures breaks the Gamefinder app.  Or find a windowscomputer to view them with.  I would also recommend the optional zoom lens.  This provides for more places to conceal the device than just having the standard lensavailable would allow.  Changing between either lens is simple and quick.

It does have an external power source so if you are using it for security you do not have to rely on batteries. However, my experience with the custom settings was quite disappointing. I followed the instruction manual and programmed the camera to record at night for security monitoring of my driveway. According to the instructions, you can customize the time it records to conserve battery life so I asked it to turn on at 11pm and off at 6 am. Frustration and disappointment resulted as it never recorded a single image in the 6 weeks it was turned on. The burglars won again and I learned the hard way that this camera only records if you set it \"always on\".

I usually set it up to take a lot of pictures and I can still get a month or better out of a set of batteries.Instead of taking certified USB drives, this one takes standard SD cards, up to 32GB, cheaper and easier to use.It has a preview screen to help you set it up. Like most cheap LCD displays though, bright sunlight really washes it out so it can be difficult to utilize at times.This one has a place on the back to loop a snake type cable lock through. Much improved but still pretty thin plastic on the loops. I suspect it wouldn't take much to break them loose.It is pretty configurable in the field now, allowing you to set it to take pictures as often as every 2 seconds.Like it's predecessor, it's pictures may be called HD but don't expect great resolution. Further than 30 yards and it is difficult to make out antlers. I don't believe the pictures are quite as sharp as the originals.One additional improvement though is the ability to change out lenses: wide angle and telephoto lenses are available but they are fairly pricey and I haven't had the opportunity to try yet.Over all, I really like this camera and would recommend it be a part of any hunter's equipment.", "Date": "October 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good daytime camera", "Author": "MNBorn", "ReviewID": "R2U4JBWB5A3YZM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the Plot Watcher Pro mainly to pattern turkey movement so daytime activity is my primary focus.
