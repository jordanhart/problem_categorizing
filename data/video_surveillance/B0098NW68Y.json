The plugCAM works over your existing electrical wires so there's no wires to run, if you have an outlet you can set up the camera for monitoring.Inside the box I found the camera, user manual, mounting screws, power cable, powerline adapter and an Ethernet cable.The plugCAM is basically two parts, the wall adapter and the actual camera. The wall adapter is the part you plugin near your router or switch and attach the Ethernet cable to it.You don't need another powerline adapter for the camera as the camera has it built right into the base.The camera can be positioned many different ways, it moves right and left and can be titled up and down.The camera features a ring of infrared LEDs around the lens and at the very top is a light sensor to let the camera know when to use the LEDs. The lens can also be turned to focus the picture.Both parts are made of plastic but that's no surprise as pretty much everything is, but both the adapter and the camera seem sturdy and well made.To use the plugCAM you just need to plug it into your network via the powerline adapter and Ethernet cable. Once done the LEDs will light up and in a few seconds it will be ready to go.To connect the camera to your network you just plug it into a standard wall outlet. Overall I found the setup to be extremely simple, it couldn't be easier really just plug and play and that's it.To monitor the camera you need to use an Android or iOS device and download the appropriate free app (I'm using Android).There are three ways to add a camera, scan the QR code on the side of the camera, search on your local network or add it manually using the ID and password on the camera. I did the local search and in a few seconds it found the camera.Pros:Very simple setupIR LEDs very brightEasy to use app for mobile devicesWorks over existing power lines so no additional cables to runMonitor via phone or tablet while awayCons:Ethernet cord rather shortPictures are a bit grainyNo video recordingConclusion:If you're looking for a way to  monitor your home while you're away I don't think you'll find anything easier to setup than the Brite-view plugCAM. The plugCAM package is just as simple as plug and play truly, if you've got electric then you can stream video. The plugCAM has many more uses than just home surveillance like keeping an eye on your baby or even your pet while you're not home. Since it uses the power lines as your network you don't need to run any cables and anywhere you have an electrical outlet you can setup the camera. The system allows you to add several additional cameras as well so you can monitor pretty much everything you want.", "Date": "October 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "A non company employee review", "Author": "MANOWAR\u00a9", "ReviewID": "R31XD3LEUIFHHG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The other reviews seem like they were written word for word from a sale pitch. Anyway here's a real honest review from an actual user.Set up is a no brainer. It really is plug and play simple. Plug in the receive into an electrical outlet and the ethernet cable into a jack or into the back of your router. Plug in the camera to an electrical outlet and scan the QR code with the iPhone App and it finds the camera. You can edit it then if you want and put in a name and new password.The video quality is 640x480 on High, 320x240 Medium and 160x120 Low. The picture is just okay. You can definitely tell whats going on in the image but don't expect Retina Display quality. Colors are weird one some things. My black tank top looked purple but my black cat looks black even when I'm holding him in my black tank top. Not sure what causes that but it's not a problem really.It works. You won't spend more than 5 minutes setting it up and image quality is more than adequate for most people. Great little system if you want to watch a remote location. I'm using it for my wife's store.A higher resolution version would be nice to have. Oh the night vision mode really does enhance the picture in poorly lit rooms.", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not bad for the price, but not all features work", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "R17MQVOKZC2DFF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased three of the BVC-500C's from Amazon's sister company, Woot for ~$50 each.  My goal was to place three in my home, and send alerts to myself when someone comes within range.  I was going to send the alerts to an e-mail account that I setup which had virtually unlimited space.  It turns out that the feature to send the photos to e-mail does not work.  When I called support, they stated that it's a bug, it has not worked in a long time, and they did not know when or if this feature would work in the future.As my goal is to send the photos offsite, which will allow me to retrieve them remotely.  I then found an alternate option, sending my photos to online stores (Dropbox, Box, etc.).  That seems to work.  I did this with both photos and videos, and I can retrieve the photos or videos remotely.  The only downside is I need to leave my PC on all the time.The quality of the videos are mediocre.  If you are looking to identify an intruder that you don't know, you might be out of luck.  If you are looking to identify an intruder you do know (your biggest or smallest kid getting into the cookie jar), you should be okay.The motion sensor sometimes snaps the photo before or after the person is in full view.  You need to play with this a bit before you find the correct setting.  After having consistent issues with this, I decided to use both video and photos.  Between the two of them, I can usually see who is coming in range of the camera.If you are just looking to use the mobile apps, which don't record photos or videos, you will probably rate this as 4 or 5 stars.  I've used the Android app without issue.  If you are looking to use the alerting feature to get photos of videos of people only when they are in range, you will probably consider this a 3 star product.", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "plugCAM is so EASY to use!!", "Author": "Benny", "ReviewID": "R34M3FE2ICHZN7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would just echo what has already been said in other review. The plugCAM starter kit does the job as advertised. It's really easy to use and setup.Simply connect plugCAM adapter to router with ethernet cable and plug camera to any wall socket in my house. then it's done.No WiFi setting or PC software installation required.Scan QR code to add camera onto iPhone is plus. My wife loves this feature and plans to get another starter kit for her parents who live in Japan now.It really gives a lot of peace in mind when we are in US and know we can access the camera that deploy in Japan anytime.Since it's so easy to setup, we have no worries that her parents don't know how to set it up.In addition, the plugCAM transmits video through home powerline so I can place camera in my basement that even wi-fi signal can't reach.It's one of the reason that I bought the plugCAM and sending back another brand product that doesn't meet our needs.Video quality is ok to watch from my iPhone 4s. Since I am having limited data plan, I always set video resolution to 320x240 in casenot to get data overage charge while accessing the camera under 3G network.It's a good product and really fits our expectation. If you want to place a camera in the house that wifi signal can't reach, then you should get plugCAM.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "The PlugCAM is the easiest to configure internet connected gadget I have ever used.", "Author": "Ryan J.

You view the video with a free iPhone app or Android app on your smartphone.The Starter Kit comes with everything you need: Camera, PLC adapter, cables and mounting screws.I already have a powerline setup in my house. I did not have to plug in the PLC adapter that needs to be connected via an ethernet cable to your router. I just plugged the camrea in a wall socket. Then I downloaded the iPhone app and scanned the QR code on the bottom of the camera - done. The video appeared bright and clear on my iPhone. Again. There is nothing to configure. It just works literally plug and play. You can if you want name your camera and change settings later on.The access to the plugCAM works also when your are away from home.The LEDs on the camera make it possible to also see video footage from dark rooms or during the night.The resolution of the plugCAM is not high to keep the bandwidth usage manageable. You get at the highest setting VGA at 7fps. Rather use a lower resolution at higher fps. After all you want to see what is going on and not make a home movie. The plugCAM iPhone app can take stills from the video footage, but does not record video segments.ProsVery Easy To UseUses PLC not Wi-Fi for hassle-free networkingSmartphone apps to view footageConsCamera unit could be smallerNot waterproof for outdoor useIf you want to keep an eye on your pets, kids, a machine or anything quickly and affordably from remote than the plugCAM is for you.", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Brite View plugCAM", "Author": "Chad \"SD Slim\"", "ReviewID": "R3TOKTPZBUGLRJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the Brite View plugCAM from Amazon's scrufty nephew, \"Woot\" at a discounted price. The fact it was discounted was likely a clue; the camera definitely (and admittedly, by Brite View customer support) does NOT provide all the features advertised. Or, in my case the feature \"desired\". I purchased the camera to monitor property I own, and in particular purchased for the \"motion alert/notification\" feature. I could not get the alert email setup, so called Brite View support. I was told, outright, \"we had problems with that feature, so it's been disabled\". When I mentioned \"it's still advertised to provide email alerts\" the response was, \"yeah, we know that, but unfortunately, that feature doesn't work\". Honest, but disappointing. Just a heads-up if you're thinking about the plugCAM for the email alert feature. Otherwise, the video quality is \"moderate to poor\". Night vision is \"moderate to poor\". Reliability (for me) is \"moderate to poor\". On the plus side, I like the PLC (home-plug)house-wiring connect feature.  It is, definitely, a very easy setup, but, for me, that's where the good news ends.
