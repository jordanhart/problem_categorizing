This has higher TVL than some of the other cheap ones I have tried in the same price range (480TVL vs. 420TVL), but the picture quality is much worse.  The CMOS sensor in this camera definitely isn't as good as a CCD sensor, or other higher-end CMOS cameras.  During daylight, the color values I'm getting are off, regardless of my adjustments.  At night, the IR lamps are very bright and completely wash out areas that are less than 20 feet from the camera. I guess this may be good if you are trying to view a long, open are but for my camera position it is terrible at night.  There is also a lot of image noise (graininess) For what it is, this camera is over-priced, even at the 20% reduced price I paid. If you are on a budget, check out the VideoSecu CCD cameras on Amazon, these will give you a much better picture and for a little less money.  If you can spend an extra $30 - $40 on a camera, you can easily get something that is 3x to 4x better.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Defender will Get the Job Done", "Author": "Louis Jackson, Sr.", "ReviewID": "R273C3Y0YD710Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Strong brilliant color and lucidity of items viewed for both day and night viewing.Recommended for both home and office indoor and outdoor observations.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "good camera for price", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R1332QKBXZH0F0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good camera for the money, and easy to set up, just wish it had audio then I would by a few more", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "look for better", "Author": "Duane Starkey", "ReviewID": "R34YVUZWFXPIWM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "this product already broke on me within 6 months, crap, i would not recommend to any one, look for a better one", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Resolution is poor", "Author": "Stanley P.

The camera itself is of a lower quality compared to the other products but it still does its job.  I would say that it is really only useful up to about 30ft before it would be hard to make out descriptive things about an intruder etc.Since it is a \"night vision\" camera (ie uses infrared lights to light up the night) the camera doesn't use IR filters that you find on point and shoot cameras that give you nice colorful pictures.  The color that this camera captures may not always be true colors (ie black looks purple etc).  And at night, if there is too much IR light, this will definitely not be in color and may be washed out all together.This purchase comes with the camera, mounting screws, and 65ft cable.  Everything you need when adding this on to the defender system.If you are on a budget and looking to expand your defender security system, I recommend this buy.  If you can afford the better camera, by all means do it!", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Add-On Camera", "Author": "Stanley J.

I send the screenshot to shoptronics and was told that I purchased straight from them so the free shipping did not apply. Ok, so i filed that under the stupid on my part for falling for that. BTW I work at a post office and $25 is way over priced for this small box - the item should have only been $13 with insurance and priority mail. Problem 2: So I spend a couple hours running the new wires and putting the new camera up just to find out the camera is defective! Its really dark and blurry with some kind of weird shadow affect. (this is getting sarcastically funny now) Problem 3: SO I contact shoptronic (already knowing the answer) and of course they tell me its my responsibility to pay postage to mail it back. Oh yeah! guess how much it costs to mail it back??? >>> $13!!! OOOOHHHNNNNNOOOO this has been a terrible experience!!! I have spend soooo much time trying to get this camera done I am sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo disappointed.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Super!", "Author": "Lisa R \"Lisa R\"", "ReviewID": "R6KO3Q295N0EB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased this as an additional camera for our system, and it is as perfect as those we purchased in the kit.
