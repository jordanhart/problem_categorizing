I did a metal box, put it on a wall next to the door, then I put camera inside the box at 45* so one side of camera angle view was along the wall. more than that: the metal box at 4ft height and turned a little up so if the stranger wearing hood and look down the camera shuts right in a face. regarding inside units to feed them the power outlet should be around I took electricity from a switch and all the wires put inside the wall ( look at the picture). So since everybody has its own location and to have it nice professional installation needed. The unit is good.All the best. :)", "Date": "February 4, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00FRAU42M"}}
