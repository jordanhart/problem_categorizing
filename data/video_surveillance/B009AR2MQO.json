{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Surprised by its performance but room for improvement", "Author": "M. Kelley \"mpkelley20\"", "ReviewID": "R3KEZ48ARXSWT0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I give this more of a 3 1/2 stars...I recently began looking into home video surveillance and home automation and acquired some products from a different manufacturer that lets you control video, thermostats, doors, lights, etc.. through a smartphone.  My issue with that set of products is the need for monthly subscription to use it as well as the high prices of the components.  I was very excited when I got the opportunity to try the Belkin video camera as it was cheaper and does not require a monthly subscription.  Sure, it doesn't have all the home automation features that the other system has but I was more concerned with the video monitoring anyway.  Overall I am pleased with how it works but there is definitely room for improvement.Getting the camera up and running was actually quite easy and did not require me to hook it up to a computer or my home router.  I simply connected it to my phone as a wifi connection, followed the instructions and then flipped a switch on the back of the camera to go into video mode.  The app I downloaded to control it was for my Iphone 4S.  Initially, when the first picture came up I was terribly disappointed in the quality.  It looked like complete haze.  That's when I realized that the box had been outside for a while and the lens was simply covered in fog.  I wiped it down and it looked much better.The video quality while viewing it over a wi-fi network on my Iphone was very good.  The camera angle is very wide so I can get a good portion of my first floor including my front door.  You can modify the quality of the video through the app so if you have less bandwidth, it will send a lower quality stream.  However, even at its best quality, its only 640x480.  Over a 3G connection, I had to manually turn down the video quality in order for it to be displayed but I didn't really notice much of a degradation in quality.  Guessing it's because the iphone screen is so small that it really doesn't matter.Here are the things I like about the camera1.  Cheaper than others I looked at.  Compared to the Nexia line of cameras, this is priced much better2.  No subscription required to use it3.  Quality is about as good as the Nexia ones I use4.  Night vision is pretty good.  All black and white but pretty clear5.  Sound!!!! Yes, this has the ability to stream audio as well which my nexia camera does not6.  Recording to the Iphone rather than some cloud server that limits your space7.  Like my more expensive solution, this does e-mail alerts based on motionHere are the things that can be improved1. The video is severely delayed and choppy.  This does not produce \"real time\" video like the nexia and seems to only capture a frame or two every few seconds regardless of what type of connection I am on2. Manual adjustment is annoying.  This seems like it could be an easy update to the app to allow the app to automatically adjust the quality settings when bandwidth is limited.  Waiting for a a minute or two and then getting a \"sorry\" message is annoying.  Please build in auto adjust for this.3. Load times can be long compared to other camera I have.Like I said, more of a 3 and a half stars with the ability for this to be a 4 star if they can improve the video fps and the bandwidth detection.  If those can be addressed either in software or a newer camera, this could be my solution for video surveillance around my house.  Will be a lot cheaper than paying a monthly fee for something that does the same thing!", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "I can't recommend this camera", "Author": "J. Luu", "ReviewID": "RWZI42E4664YC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'll start with what is good about this camera:1.  Small, reasonably well built.2.  Good night vision. I can see across the room for about 20 ft in total darkness.3.  Easy set up:  hint...when setting up, put the camera as close to your wifi router as possible. The signal strength is poor, and it can take for ever to connect, and usually doesn't connect at all. Other than that, set up is as simple as can be.4.  With good connection, the camera is very stable.  I've had it running 24/7 for a week now without issue.5.  Motion detector image capture...email notification works well.Why I wouldn't use this camera?1.  Wifi strength is poor.  I'm placing it 50 feet away, granted there are 2 interior walls in between, and signal drops off constantly.2.  Although the camera does have an ethernet port, the port is non-functional...compounding the weak wifi signal issue.3.  Software sucks... You can't view the camera on a computer.  You must use their iphone app.  The app sucks.  Worse of any camera app out there.  First off, it crashes all the time.  Second even on 4g LTE it has a hard time pulling videos through.  I'd have to downgrade the video quality substantially to get a video connection.  Third is it hardly works on Ipads...crashes more often than on the iphone.4.  Worse, most irritating part is that this camera is proprietary.  You can't view the camera with Blue iris or any other app/program.  This makes point #3 even worse.  I'm not an expert by any means, but I simply can't get this camera to behave like a typical IP cam.5.  Poor value. This camera doesn't tilt, pan, or zoom....for $100 bucks I'd go elsewhere.What would I recommend?  I now have done a ton of research and own 2 other systems...the Foscam 8910 and the Logitech Alert.  Here's my opinion of the 3 system for what it's worth:1.  My favorite is the Logitech Alert.  You want this if you have a newer house with normal electrical wiring.  By that I mean not spliced, added on, modified, etc.  The construction quality is best of the 3 by a mile.  Image quality during day, dim, and dark times are the best by far.  Set up is simple and brainless.  Signal connection and stability is much better than wifi.  Open architecture means you can view your camera through VLC, Blue iris, etc...so if Logitech goes belly up, your camera is still functional.  What I don't like about the Alert system is that there is no tilt/pan/zoom....false advertisement.  The software only support 6 cameras, although you can view more if you use Blue iris.  The app does suck, but you can use Blue iris which works great on both iphone and ipad.  These are more expensive (hint....much cheaper if you use the 'configure' option on Logitech's site)but are the best out there.2. Foscam is pretty good. Image quality is on par with the Belkin.  There's true tilt and pan, the ethernet port works, stable, fast, and the software and flexibility is just unbeatable.", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid camera", "Author": "SteelerFan4Life", "ReviewID": "R8S7LT35EULOS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I foster dogs and got this camera to watch them when I'm out of the house. It's really great for my needs. I put it on my mantle in my living room and the view is pretty wide so I can see the whole room. I have an iphone and nexus7 and it works on both. I setup the notifications and was getting them every few minutes when the dogs moved, so I stopped using it but it seemed to work really well.The only reason I'm giving it a 4 not a 5 is the audio could be better.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very good picture quality, easy to set up, one flaw, possibly fatal", "Author": "Lenny", "ReviewID": "R2GWQV29J5SSM3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start with the summary, since the review is a very long one. This is an indoor camera. Great picture quality (non HD), very easy to set up and operate, works well with Android tablet (I don't have any iOS device to test with, but I'd imagine it works just as well, or better) and you can let any number of friends view the camera - they don't need to own a camera. But there is one potential security issue with the camera.The flaw with this camera could be a deal breaker for some people, so I will mention it first. You need to create an account with Belkin, and anyone with access to the account will be able able access your camera.There is no way around that if you want to use this camera. You cannot operate it in \"local only\" mode (connect to the camera directly). There should be a way, but Belkin is not telling us what it is. If I find out through reverse engineering, I will update this review.Why is this important? If someone manages to guess your password, or if Belkin's security is compromised, you have no way of preventing people from looking into your house unless you turn it off. With other IP cameras, the password is only stored locally on the device, and is much less prone to being hacked. With some network expertise, you can create VPN tunnels that you need to connect to before you can view those type of cameras. You don't have such a choice with this one.This won't be an issue if the camera is being set up in a public area (for example, a restaurant). At home, however, I feel uncomfortable knowing that a stranger could be peering into my house.OK, now that this is out of the way, let us go on to the other features of this camera.Build quality : The camera is nicely constructed, smooth plastic shell that fits nicely together. The base is weighed down by a heavy metal washer at the base, so it will not topple over easily. The power supply cord is long - 10 feet (I measured). The stated output is 5V, 1.5A.Setup : the camera is very easy to configure, as long as you have an Android or iOS smartphone or a tablet. There is a little switch at the back of the camera - the only switch there, in fact. In the \"up\" position, it is in setup mode. In the \"down\" position, it is in camera mode. You should have received it in setup mode.When in setup mode, the camera powers up (by plugging in the power cable) and presents a wireless access point for your device to connect to. Use your phone or tablet's wifi setup to connect to it. There's no password. After you're connected, launch the app, which will guide you through the rest of the setup. If you messed something up, exit the app and launch it again. It will guide you through the steps all over again - connect to your home wifi router and register an account with Belkin - or log in to an existing account.Operation : Using the camera only requires you to flip the switch over to camera mode after you're done with the setup. Run the app, log in, and you're presented with a list of your cameras. Click on it and you can view it. You can also view the camera through your computer's browser by going to netcam dot belkin dot com (sorry for the minor obfuscation - Amazon seems to block most URLs I type in). In Firefox I'm prompted to install the iSecurity+ plugin, but I can use it with the old video player.(Edit 3/26 : n let me know in the comments below that it seems no longer possible to create an account from the login page. Not sure if this is temporary - I will check with Belkin and see what they say. For the moment - the following paragraph is no longer valid)You can create an account on a browser and view cameras that other people share with you even if you don't own a Netcam.  Anyone you share the camera with will need to do this. There are also public cameras available. At the time of this writing, there are two public netcams listed - both from the Silicon Valley Animal Control Authority.(Edit 3/26 : above paragraph is currently invalid - I need to find out from Belkin if it is permanently disabled)From the app or the browser, you can view your own cameras, your friends' cameras, and invite friends (by sending them an email) to view your cameras, and to revoke access to your camera. You can also set your own camera to \"private\" mode (meaning you're the only account that can view it).Infra-red works well, but in auto mode, the IR comes on whenever light level drops low enough, even when the camera is not being viewed. Alternatively you can set IR explicitly on or off (need to go into setup screen to do this). You cannot control the IR that someone shares with you, and motion detection will not work in the dark if IR is off. The IR LEDs gives off a faint reddish glow when in operation that's visible when it is very dark.There is no local (in-camera) recording capability. Recording is done by your phone using the app.Email motion detection alerts appear to work OK. You get an email with two photos when motion is detected. There doesn't appear to be a way to throttle the number of emails sent, so if you happen to have the camera pointed at a busy scene, be prepared for a flood of emails. A slowly changing scene will not trigger motion detection - for example, shadows cast by the sun moving slowly across the room will not trip it.Performance : The camera has a very clear picture and sound is decent. There is a small delay in video (about 0.25 seconds) and a much longer one in the audio (about 2 seconds). I was able to connect from outside my home network to the camera without needing to configure anything on my home router. In fact, I had the camera connected to a wireless router, that's connected to another wireless router (two layers of NAT), both with uPNP and port forwarding disabled. This suggests that the camera is connecting to Belkin's servers instead of the other way around.Power consumption : I measured this with a Kill-a-Watt. Power consumption is very low. I measured it at 2W when the IR is off, and 3W when IR is on. Changing frame rate, picture quality, and other parameters didn't affect power consumption in any way that can be measured by the Kill-a-Watt. I left it on for 24 hours and it reported a total energy consumption of 0.05 kWh. Assuming IR is left on auto, this device will consume under 2 kWh in a month - less than 50 cents for the typical user.The power plug can take 100-240V @ 50-60Hz. The output is 5V 1.5A.So, again, in summary - has great image quality (640 x 480), has sound, really easy to set up, it just works without having to configure anything with your home router, but the password is stored at Belkin's server.", "Date": "February 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very bright picture!

two reservations. Most importantly, the picture is dull, with most of the color bleached out, which means that it's not only less pleasant to look at, but less useful than it could be. I've had it pointed at my front porch and, for example, cannot tell whether the red flag on the mailbox is up or not because the red blends in with the green bushes behind it. (Notice that in the attached video you can see the red flag just fine!) Second, the email alerts are not that helpful, for two reasons. First, they're so sensitive that I receive notices when cars go by, which I don't really care about. Second, last I checked with Dropcam, the alerts only go out once every half hour. So if someone comes to your door between one alert and the next, you're not notified by email.With that background, I got my hands on a Belkin NetCam. I was delighted by it immediately. Here's what I like about it:1. The setup was absolutely simple. No problems whatever. I had it running in minutes.2. The picture is BRIGHT. Far brighter than what I get with the Dropcam. I've added two images to this item to show the differences between the two.3. You can take pictures or video of what the camera is seeing on the fly. The video attached to this review was taken that way with the microphone off at 640 x 480, with a frame rate of 15 (out of a possible 30) and a quality of 5 (out f 5).4. You can choose to receive email alerts when the device detects motion. Unlike the Dropcam, there is no thirty-minute delay, so when the camera detects motion, you get an email. This is a good thing. The other thing I like about the email alerts is that they include two pictures rather than one. Very often with the Dropcam, which sends one picture, you get a photo when something has just entered the area being monitored, and you can barely tell what it is. With two pictures, you get that first image and the a second one, when whatever has entered the area farther into the frame. The result is a much more informative alert.What could be improved:1. As for negatives, the only real downside of the device for me also has to do with the email alerts. You can adjust the sensitivity of the motion detection with settings from 1-5. What I'd like is to receive alerts whenever someone comes to my door or is in the front yard, say, some 15 feet from the camera. But none of the settings give me that. A setting of 1 seems to result in no alerts coming in at all. But settings from 2-5 result in my getting alerts for cars driving by. Admittedly, sometimes I seem to get fewer alerts about passing cars than other times, and I'm not sure yet what the pattern is. Certainly all settings from 2-5 have alerted me about traffic in front of the house at one time or another. Hopefully the gradations of motion sensitivity for the alerts can be improved in software updates--I'm not sure if that's possible, however.2. There is no Kindle Fire app (yet?).3. The NetCam does not allow you to talk through the device as the Dropcam does. (That is, using the Dropcam you can talk to people in the room from some external site).

I received this camera as a gift after my VERY expensive Summer baby monitor quit working. I needed a product that was easy to use, had good picture quality, and had an audio feed. This product does all of that, and moreover, does it really well. While I realize that I am not using this camera as it is intended, it is fantastic. Set up is a snap and the app for my iphone has been great. Once in a while it's slow or crashes, but it has not been a big deal. The picture quality is great despite that the room is pitch dark at night and I can see almost the entire bedroom as well. We have also had no issues with this product when using an ipad. Both ipads and iphones have worked very well with this product. If you are going to use this as a baby monitor it is important to note that if you want to watch/hear your baby all night long or for the duration of nap time, this is not the product for you. It will allow you to see/hear for about a 15 minute window and then shut down if you do not click on the screen and say you're still watching.

I have been eyeing different models and manufacturers but the opportunity to test this one made my choice easy. It is at best a mixed bag at worst a useless device.First the setup, It is very simple to set up. After removing it from the box, there is a quick setup guide that walks you through the procedure. Essentially you download the appropriate app, I have iOS devices. Then plug it in and set the switch on the back of the camera to the top position. This broadcasts a Wi-Fi name that you can log onto from your iPad/iPhone in the Settings App, not the Belkin App. You can then make your configurations, create or login to your Belkin Netcam account and when done, press the switch into the operational mode. After this is done you put your device back onto your home Wi-Fi or cell service. You can now run the Belkin app and see your camera in action. Action, yeah, that's a word. I have 2MB up speed on my Internet connection, that's 2-3 times an average up speed. Still, the best I can get is bumpy or freezing video. It is very frustrating. I started playing with the settings for the camera and I could not find a happy medium. I also couldn't stop the eventual freezing. I also found the sound pretty much useless as all I got was a loud \"hooting\" sound. This was all from the app, both on the iPad (in stretch mode) and the iPhone 5 on local wifi or AT&T; LTE.I then logged into the Belkin Netcam web site. It proved to be better than the app but I still had problems. When the light was good I got a decent if bumpy image. If the light was dim but not dark colors and clarity suffered. In darkness the red LEDs kick on and the infra-red takes over. The image is a black and white and looks like a 7-11 spy cam. It's cool but has the same problems as above.I checked for a firmware update and I am up to date on the camera. The app needs an update as I think most of the issues stem from there. It all really needs updating. When both get updated I'll try to run it again and will update this review. Until then, I can't recommend it.

There is audio (not great but adequate). You can view on a phone/tablet using the netcam app (ios/android) or you can view on a computer on a netcam website. you can set it up to email you if motion is detected and you can change the sensitivity for the motion detection.

So I got this camera, set it up and caught a maintenance guy looking in my fridge! He had no business being in the kitchen at all! I had set the camera up to email me if motion was detected, I got the email with 2 screenshots it takes automatically when motion is detected. I then logged into the netcam app, and watched the guy live, I took screenshots and recorded some video using the app to prove to the leasing office what this guy was doing.

What in the heck were people expecting? I love them. They work great. Have been mounted outside for 5 months in the hot AZ desert that is Phoenix. Have had no problems. The pics are great. They are online ALL the time without glitches. Can adjust camera settings online. Yes, the Audio sucks but I don't care about that. I am not a techie but had NO problem setting them up. Everything worked right out of the box.UPDATE: 8/19/2013  All four cameras have been working perfectly (mounted OUTSIDE!) through the last three hot summer months in Phoenix. This is the ultimate heat, dust, wind and even some severe thunderstorms test. They are mounted outside but are in covered positions. The pics are very clear and video is very, very good. True the sound is garbage but so what? With one exception, we have been able to get on to Belkin every time we want to, which is almost every day. I access the cameras through my iPhone and there is no problem at all. Once in a while it doesn't connect to the camera and you have to ask it to do it again...then it always comes through. We've been able to see the racoons come up on the patio and try to steal the cat food and sent someone to our house to remedy that, we can see that the pool man actually does come every Monday. I can see that my yard man did NOT come for a whole month and he is history!  It is really great that you can set each cameras speed and sensitivity and we do have them set differently to accommodate our needs. We get snapshots sent to us whenever a camera is activated. The only problem we had was in the beginning there was a power-out at our house and the router would not kick in again so we had to go have someone reset it. We feel we have already got our money out of these cameras. I still can't believe that the lenses have stayed so clear and that we still get great looking pics and videos. I also really love the fact that we don't have to pay a stinking monthly service fee! LOLEND OF UPDATE_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________We really needed outdoor cams but shopping for them online was overwhelming. Our needs were: wireless, plug & play easy set-up, view on iPhones & web, no monthly charge, clear video, reasonable price (about $100) and either outdoor or good view from window to outdoors.Well, the outdoor cams didn't have what we wanted for a price we wanted so we went with the Belkin. Ordered one, tested it outside and through windows, tested the notifications and recording and ordered three more today.This little cam works very well. Set-up was indeed a snap...just plugged it in and it found our network. The iPhone Belkin Netcam free app works very well.While this isn't really a \"multi-camera\" system the screen on the iPhone app shows each camera and it's simple to just select the camera you want to view. The IR feature does not work through windows but the regular video through windows is excellent. The IR works extremely well if not placed in front of a window however. The audio is very poor with just a lot of hissing. So we will put one outside in a covered area to see if it can take the Phoenix AZ summer heat. Will let you know if it survived. As a note....when we went to order three more the price went up $20 bucks!

The night vision feature was superb and the audio support was also great.  The motion detection alert by email was a feature that I cannot miss.  The quality of picture is decent and the app, Netcam worked flawlessly on both of my android phone and iPad.However, the major problem of the Belkin NetCam Wireless was that the connection was very shaky.  I was not very successful connecting to the Belkin NetCam Wireless from outside.  Almost half of the time I tried by using many different Wifi environments, I couldn't establish a connection.

The set up  instructions are perhaps too simple... an 8-page, 2-sided accordion-fold piece, each \"page\" about the size of an index card.  The first page says to plug the camera in and put a switch into the setup mode.  The next three pages are for IOS setup, the next three for Android:  Use your wifi device to connect to the camera's wifi, download the Netcam app to your device, launch the app to give the camera its user name and password.  The last page tells you to flip the switch OUT of setup.  The back side of the accordion set tells you how to mount the camera with screws, has the FCC etc. and has a small statement about how to view the camera from an internet computer.I was able to get through the setup without any problems, although the camera warned that it wasn't getting a very strong wifi signal.  Now, all the *other* wifi devices seemed to be doing fine in that spot, and nowhere that I moved it seemed to help.  I don't think it has a very strong wifi antenna.The directions *don't* tell you that to configure things like the frames per second, the rotation rate, the infrared, etc. you really do appear to need to go to the website and log in -- at least, I can't find any spot to adjust these settings on the Android app.  From the website you can also set up email for motion detection, with a slider for sensitivity.  I have set the sensitivity as low as possible and danced in front of this camera and have, as yet, received no notifications, nor does there appear to be a log to check activity without getting emails.  (Later note:  Once I turned off all the lights to try the infra-red, I *did* get an email... then, email detection continued to work for several hours.  Then I changed the \"to\" email address, and it stopped working again. <shrug>)You can remotely configure the camera to rotate, but can't set its rotation angle from the computer, i.e. you can say \"move back and forth,\" but you can't cause it to move a few degrees to the left and then stop there.  You can't adjust the \"up and down\" dimension remotely at all.I am consistently able to use the Android app to view the camera feed, at least for the couple of minutes that it allows before it goes inactive and tells you to log in again if you wish to continue viewing.  I am consistently unable to use the internet login to view the camera feed.  At first, I thought this was a bandwidth issue connecting my home to the internet, but that appears to not be the case -- the website feed just doesn't work, at least with either Chrome or IE browsers.The rectangular camera sits up on a rather slender stem on a small pedestal.  A simple ring screw untightens to allow you to change the angle of the camera on a little ball joint with relation to its stem, then tighten the ring to fix it into place.The infrared lights seem quite dim when on in the dark, but do an effective job -- objects 10-12 feet away are quite clear.My bottom line is this -- the big strength of this camera is the simplicity of setting it up to be seen remotely, from your Android or IOS device, or (hopefully, for those with faster bandwidth) from the internet.  On my other wireless webcam, you have to do some moderately-sophisticated router tweaking to configure things so you can see the feed from outside your local home network, and there is only a website interface, no mobile device app.On the other hand, my other wireless webcam is more full-featured, and works better.  I can log into it and see its feed using devices larger than my phone AND I can leave the feed up indefinitely; I can rotate it sideways and up and down remotely; it keeps a log of motion events and will record still shots or video for me to go look at, or they are freely emailed to me; it is short and squat like R2D2 and so very stable. That camera also generally retails for less.I'm a big fan of wireless cameras as opposed to those that have to be connected to the \"base\" with a video cable, but this Belkin Webcam camera is not the one that will come first in my toolbox.", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Watching my cats", "Author": "G.

So, I unplugged it and plugged it back in.  Minutes later, I could access the video again, both from the website and the app.2) Lack of a dedicated iPad app.  Apparently, the only way to run the NetCam app on the iPad is to run the iPhone app in full screen mode.  This isn't a huge deal, but if you are going to market a camera as being designed to use with tablets, then a tablet-specific app seems appropriate.3) Support forums show general dissatisfaction.  Search the web for Belkin NetCam Community Support and you will observe that people are running into connection problems, and the only response from Belkin seems to be \"Here's a link to the installation manual\".I'm going to keep an eye out for a firmware update to the camera.  Perhaps that will resolve the unreliable streaming problem.  For now, though, I have a hard time recommending this camera until issue 1, above, is resolved.*** END UPDATE ***Understand that this wi-fi camera is very specifically meant to work hand-in-hand with an iOS or Android device.  In fact, the short set of instructions only walk you through setting up the camera by using Belkin's freely available \"NetCam\" app.  (Once setup, you can also access it through Belkin's website.)  In that regard, setup was extremely simple.  I sat in my living room, plugged in the camera's power adapter, downloaded the app to my iPhone, and in just a couple minutes, the camera was streaming to the phone.  Belkin advertises that \"setup is a breeze\", and I couldn't agree more.So, if ease of setup is your number one priority (and if you plan to use this with a smartphone or tablet), then I can easily recommend this camera.  And, the mobile app is very easy to use, and even allows for some basic configuring of the camera.  However...This Belkin camera lacks a LOT of functionality that can be found in similarly priced IP cameras.  By contrast, I recently purchased the Foscam FI8910W Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with Two-Way Audio and Night Vision (Black), which is roughly the same cost as this Belkin NetCam (sometimes even less expensive).  Here's a list of features found in the Foscam that are NOT found in the Belkin:* Pan/Tilt/Zoom allows you to see much more of a room than the stationary Belkin* Upload images to an FTP server OR send images by e-mail (Belkin only allows e-mail)* Access the camera in a web browser with its own unique URL (by contrast, Belkin requires that you sign up for a free account with them, and log in to their website to access your camera)* Two-way audio communication (that is, you can use the camera to talk to and listen to someone remotely, while this NetCam only allows you to listen)* Highly configurable through a web interface (the Belkin can only be configured through the app or the Belkin website)The Foscam and Belkin also have several features in common.  Both have night vision, both work over wi-fi, and both can be set up to send e-mail if motion is detected.  I will say that the Belkin has a slightly wider field of vision (you can see more of a room with the Belkin than with the Foscam if both cameras are stationary), but the ability to remotely rotate the Foscam means that you actually can see much more of the room with the Foscam.In other words, my Foscam can basically do all the things the Belkin can do, plus a whole lot more.  BUT, the Foscam is not nearly as easy to set up as the Belkin.  And, while the Foscam is accessible through a web browser, and by many third-party iOS and Android apps, the Foscam lacks a dedicated app.So, if you are in the market for an IP camera that is easy to get up and running and you need an easy way to monitor a room in your house, the Belkin NetCam may be the way to go.  If you are nervous about things like \"router configuration\" and \"dynamic DNS\", the Belkin camera protects you from all that.However, if you are willing to put a little extra effort into setting up your camera, the rewards of a pan/tilt/zoom IP camera such as the Foscam far outweigh the initial work involved.  As for me, I really prefer more advanced features over ease of setup.  The lack of extra features in the Belkin is my reason for rating it 4 stars rather than 5.", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "False Advertising", "Author": "Boriqua2000", "ReviewID": "R3LFLYBOAFLWTM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i purchased this camera to keep an eye on my kids when they get home from school and to watch my house when im at work.the camera constanly freezes.it says that you can record video but after about 10 seconds the app crashes when you try to record.it also says that it will send you email alerts when it senses movement but ive never gotten an email when my kids get home to tell me that there is movement in my house even though i have the settings set at the most sensitive.i was going to buy a few of these cameras to put around my house in various rooms but decided to buy one only to see how it works.im glad i did.i would not recommend this product.i was also thinking of buying Dropcam but purchased this instead because of the recording feature.waste of money because that feature doesn't even work.Flase Advertising all the way.", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "As good as I expected.", "Author": "R.

We had just converted her crib into a toddler bed and wanted to be able to check in on her without opening the door. I saw this camera on the shelf and thought it would be perfect since I could check the camera from my phone without having to be at a computer. I brought the camera home and followed the setup instructions, which is an easy process. I had the camera up and running in less than 10 minutes. Then I waited until we put my daughter to bed and went to log onto the camera, but the website said my camera was offline. I thought to myself, that's weird and I went and unplugged the camera for about 20 seconds and plugged it back in. My daughter was very curious at this point, since I had to go back into her room to do this. After this, the camera worked for about another 2 hours when I had to repeat this process. The camera does this every night, and there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it.The customer service is provided through the GetSatisfaction.com portal. You can check it out yourself at:[...]. I saw several other questions similar to mine, all of which have been unanswered for at least a month. I looked through all the other questions, and I can't seem to find a helpful answer to any of the questions in the entire community. I guess Belkin is not providing support for this camera any longer, so if you have problems you are on your own.Pros:-Easy to set up-Free app available for both iOS and Android-You can watch your camera from anywhere there is internet (as long as your camera hasn't crashed)Cons-Camera is very unstable. It crashes every few hours requiring a reboot which can only be done by unplugging the camera and plugging it back in.-Lack of an auto-record feature-You can only view the camera through the Belkin website. This is irritating because there is so much lag on the video and I should be able to connect directly to the camera since it's on my network.-The Belkin website is not secure, your login credentials are passed in clear text to another company called Seedonk.com (Seedonk is apparently the actual maker of this product, which is rebranded as a Belkin)-Lack of any customer supportOverallThis product is not worth the $100 price tag. I would expect to pay about $30 for something of this caliber, but I would still be upset since the camera is so unreliable. I would not recommend this camera to anyone, there are plenty of other options in the same price range. I ordered a Foscam FI8910w for less than I paid for the Belkin NetCam. The Foscam comes with a boatload of features that the Belkin does not offer. The Foscam is supposed to show up tomorrow, so I'll find out if it's any better. Watch for my review there as well. The bottom line on the Belkin NetCam is that you should consider other options.

In theory, having a camera that streams video and sound over the net so you can keep a wtchful eye on things is great. But in actuality, the overall streaming exprience sucks. I have been running the software on two phones, an older DroidX and a Samsung Galaxy Note 2. Both end results are the same. Sometimes it takes a half dozen times to finally lock in a stream.

Both have their pros and cons (the Sharx costs about $250). I like the Belkin camera (setup is a breeze with an iPhone or Android phone), but I do have some concerns. There's very little documentation beyond the setup information. All connections seem to be made through the Belkin web site (it doesn't seem like you can use it on your WiFi network without going out to the Internet for connectivity). There's a setting for \"private\" versus \"online\", but there's no documentation on what that setting actually means (they work exactly the same, as far as I can tell). And I have no idea how secure it is.Pros:*VERY easy setup with a smartphone*Good video quality*Check your camera from anywhere (if you have broadband), including a web browser*Infrared night vision is automatic and works wellCons:*Little documentation of some features*Doesn't seem to work with only LTE/cellular bandwidth*Seems dependent on the Belkin website*Video is delayed about five seconds and is less smooth than a camera which operates on your private networkOverall, I like the camera.

Fritz \"Nikon Jeff\"", "ReviewID": "R1VC0EWRT0GCI7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Belkin NetCam is a useful and somewhat unique device.In addition to being a remote camera accessible from virtually anywhere over the Web, the Netcam uses infrared (user selectable) imaging when the light is insufficient for normal camera video. The device can record video, take stills and listen in to what's going on in the room (although the audio is noisy in quiet locations.) The NetCam also has a motion sensor that alerts you by email if there is something amiss. However, a text alert alert might have been more useful.All of this functionality is neatly managed by an iPhone or Android app. Sadly, a native iPad app is conspicuously missing--although the iPhone app will work with an iPad. (Be aware that you will be asked to download and install the free Belkin NetCam app from the iTunes or Android app store. Also be aware that several apps are available on iTunes with similar names as Belkin app. Be sure to select and download the \"Belkin NetCam\" app.)Set up was not too difficult although the camera did not set up correctly the first time. After a couple of tries it finally worked. The camera worked more reliably over a wired Ethernet connection than it did over a wireless LAN connection.  Perhaps there are too many wireless LANs in my neighborhood. Happily, Belkin made sure that the camera supports both wired and wireless LANs--although the camera must be set up via its wireless LAN capability.I decided that the NetCam would make a good front door monitor, so I mounted  it outdoors to keep watch our front door. However the very cold 15 degree (F) winter temperature proved too difficult for the camera. Although it was not damaged it did stop working. Instead it was moved to our heated basement to keep watch on our basement side door. It performed much better in that location.Typical with so many devices today, the Belkin NetCam documentation is rather meager. It's a foldout paper, legible but lacking in operational detail. On one level this is fine. The instructions concentrate on setup which if, after all, the most complicated part of the operation of the NetCam. On the other hand, information on tasks such as sharing the camera feed with others is decidedly missing. As a result, I never did figure out how to share the camera's feed with my family.Still, the ability to monitor your home from literally anywhere on a variety of mobile devices is very attractive. As long as you don't get it too \"1984\" with it this is a very useful device.", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great picture, don't like you have to use the Belkin App to see it", "Author": "J.

But it's not the best camera.I  have had some experience with IP cameras lately and had the chance to try this one out.First, what I like.-It's small-It looks nice, blends into the wall-slim-easy to use, no computer needed.-crystal clear daytime pictures,-night time pictures with nightvision work decent.-able to view it from your phone or tablet.So what don't I like-you CAN NOT view this from a computer, you HAVE to use a portable device.-There is NO FTP option to upload pictures, the only way I've found to get pictures off this thing is through the Belkin app.-When viewing the camera, if you disconnect and reconnect quickly it in my case took over 60 seconds to reconnect, almost as if my first session needed to time out first.-You can't rotate the camera remotely, this is stationary.If you are looking for a basic, slim camera and don't mind having to use the belkin app, this is a great choice. It's easy to setup and use, in fact from unboxing to installation in my garage I had it done in less then 10 minutes.IF you want a camera with night vision, pan/tilt controls, ability to use various apps and configure FTP settings to send pictures to the service of your choice stay away from this camera.

I recently bought the Stem IZON IOS WRM-WA0-00 Remote Room Monitor which is like 30 bucks less than this, smaller, prettier, and looks cooler.  But that Stem camera was garbage.  It didn't work for me, at all.  It had numerous setup issues.This camera is bigger, costs more, but, at least it works.  I am using this with an iPhone 4s.  Here, let's take a look:-1) + Long power cord. I like that this has a long power cord because chances are you're not going to have an outlet near the ceiling where you want to put this anyway.2) + Is wall-mountable.  They even include screws and those plastic things you always need because chances are you're just drilling into sheetrock anyhow.3) - It's big.  No way you're tucking this into the corner of your bookshelf hoping the maid or real estate broker won't see it.  This thing screams \"YOU ARE BEING FILMED\" but, maybe that's what you need sometimes?4) - Setup wasn't that smooth.  I had issues setting it up.  The first two times I went through the steps, at the very last step, the app would hang forever, and finally give me some non-laymans-term error.  Third time was the charm, and I was FINALLY able to view the camera on my phone.5) - Quality of video, even on the best setting, isn't all that great.  It's choppy, kinda dim.  I mean for looking in on your kids or goldfish, yah, maybe it's OK.  Don't expect seamless video here.6) + Adjustable software settings.  You can adjust the camera from your phone.  You can turn on or off the night vision setting (or leave it on auto - that works really well, actually).  You can change the quality level \"1-5\" (with no mention of 1 or 5 being better or worse??) [hint: 1 is garbage quality, 5 is \"best\"].7) ++  Email alerts!  You can set it up so that it will send an email when it detects motion!  AND you can change the sensitivity from your phone!  Emails!  (Remember those!?)  Texts would be hipper, but I'll take the email option.  It sends an email with a couple photos.  I like that a lot.8) --- If you're not on wi-fi on your phone, you're not going to be able to get good quality video/pics.  When I changed my iPhone 4S from wi-fi to regular 3G signal, this thing failed.  I had to set it to the lowest quality setting (think Castle Wolfenstein graphics) to see anything at all.--------End result = it works.  Kinda.  Because you can't get great quality streaming video, it's not much use other than a motion-detector, but for me, I'm quite happy with that.  I do like the emails you get when it detects motion.

In fact, it uses the same method as the Belkin WeMo.  You first download the app to your iPhone/iPad or Android device and then connect to the camera wirelessly (which again, you need an iPhone/iPad or Android device to do it) and you go through the configuration via a downloadable app.The framerate is terrible.  Otherwise, it can be a great spot-check baby monitor or inexpensive security device.  Its not a DVR, so its only practical when you are viewing the video live.  You can record or take snapshots of live video.  I don't suggest leaving the video running on your device, as it will drain the battery.  In fact, on my wife's iPhone, the screen doesn't turn off until you close the app.  I found this to be a curious override of the iPhone's screen timeout.It displays in color during the day (again, on your phone/tablet using the app), and in infrared at night.  The picture is clear, but the one-way sound is nothing but static. That was disappointing.Overall, its...ok.  We originally thought we could use it as a baby monitor, but then its practical limitations came to light.  Its only a spot-check device.It does work over wifi or over the internet using our 4GLTE  phones.  It is probably too slow to view over 3G data.  You an also view it on your pc after you go to Belkin's website (listed in the instructions) and install a plugin (which was not  mentioned in the instructions).I'm happy with it, but only as a spot-check device.(As another review mentioned, it is a re-branding of another brand's camera.

My idea of a good camera is something that doesn't take me a month to figure out how to set it up, one that takes a halfway decent picture, and one that allows me to record in some way off site, what is going on if I want to.My reason for wanting a camera is that I don't trust too many people these days and I want the ability to know what's going on at home while I am at work.  For me, this camera acts in 2 ways.  First, as a nanny cam.  I have a babysitter watch my kids 2 days a week in the midweek and I want to make sure that they are taken care of properly.  Eventhough this isn't a hidden camera, it serves well the purpose because the babysitter knows that I can watch and therefore is usually on her game.  The second reason for it is for security purposes.  This camera also does an okay job with this as well.  The night vision is good and the daylight picture is fine.Setup for this item was very easy.  From the time I opened the box to the time I was watching it on my computer was about 15 minutes.  Most of that time was looking for a place to put it that isn't already being used by another camera.For those reviewers that complain about the choppy nature of the picture, they need to realize that it is sending a wireless signal with sound and the size of that wireless signal going over an internet connection that is probably being taxed by other devices using the signal will affect this.  I do not find it annoying at all because it is what I have with my other cameras.  If you want one that is less choppy, then go with a camera DVR setup that connects directly to the interent over a high speed internet service.Picture on this unit is fine.  I can make out details of who is walking through the field of view so that in the event something were to need to go to court, I have what I need.  The downside is that because of the frame rate, some of the details can be blurry if the subject is moving very fast through the field of view.Sound is a bonus.  I don't need the sound but it is nice to hear the kids laughing when I am having a tough day at the office.Overall impression:  Yeah, there may be better cameras on the market, but overall, this camera performs as well as most others in its price category and worth looking at.

They work and consequently the Belkin NetCam works well too.I set this up in the \"dog's room\" and attached it to a Note II to determine if it works and how well it works.  It performs as well as any camera of this nature can work given that there is an understood delay between transmission points.  Let me quickly add that the delay is no more than 2 seconds in most cases and in some cases the delay is about 1 second.  Neither condition is a deal breaker but it could have a review devaluation of about .5 to 1 point.  I did not downgrade this camera because it works so well.  When we are away from home and call the dogs on the camera it is funny as can be so see them come to the camera and bark at it.  \"Do not forget the treats this time, you old codgers\" is their favorite reminder.  I would like to have been able to use it with Windows 8; however, either I cannot figure out how to make it work or the camera is strictly for Droid and Apple's iOS systems.  It does not matter a whole bunch since it works fine on the Note II.The video definition is decent and so is the audio.  The wide-angle is so much better than a spot type angle.  If there were multiple cameras throughout a location then perhaps a spot would be better but I prefer the wide-angle for most applications. Even the night viewing is stronger than I expected.  Overall, this is a quality camera and maybe it works so well since it is attached to a Belkin router and enhancer.  I did not attach the camera to another router to test, however.", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cute Compact Easy to Use", "Author": "mk", "ReviewID": "R3GYZEMM25VHK0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little netcam is a neat idea that allows keeping an eye via your smartphone or tablet. on your home with nightvison/infrared.I have no issues with this unit.

Interestingly, the site they have you post questions to Is a secure site.B) There appear to be audio issues. With both units I've tried I've either heard horrible static or a horrible high pitched noise. The actual audio is nearly impossible to hear because of this. I'm not sure if this is a problem with the microphone or with the feed from Belkin's cloud. Whatever the reason, it makes the audio component worthless. (Hopefully my two units were the exceptions). In addition, when viewing from the web there is no audio option (at least on the browsers I've tried).C) The booklet contained doesn't explain the settings and not all of the settings are obvious. Poor communication on the part of Belkin.D) Notifications of motion are only available via email. If your email is unreliable a thief could be rummaging through your home without you knowing. The app iCam offers very reliable push notifications that provide nearly, if not immediate, alerts. Belkin should offer this too.F) If you have more than one NetCam there is no split screen option to view. You have to view each one seperately.G) The NetCam can NOT be turned off via your computer or App. There is not even an on/off switch. In order to turn it off you must unplug it!When I've plugged it back in the App has a hard time retrieving the video feed again.H) The email notifications only include two images. If you would like to record more images or video you have to do it manually. Motion will NOT trigger recording of video and it is not an option.

I have been specifically looking for a network camera that has motion detection and email notification. This product has very limited settings. There seems to be no difference between a sensitivity setting of one (minimum) and 5 (maximum). I have left the camera running for several days and when I return I have little or no notifications. I have two cats and they don't trigger the motion detection. Sometimes I get email notifications with pictures lacking movement, there is nothing in the frame. I can activated the camera, leave for the day, come back and walk directly up to the camera and smile with no notifications.The limited sensitivity settings are a major draw back. The frequency settings are also minimal. There are two options. I have tried other cameras that allow many more setting like amount of pictures per second, amount of seconds to check once first movement is detected, amount of time to wait before checking for new movement once detected, and how many picture to email.I wouldn't not recommend this product if you are looking for a network Camera with motion detection and notification.

The other reviews can give you a sense of this camera.SAME FOR MOTOROLA BLINK1:* Infrared illumination for night. This creates a surreal type of scene, since the shading is different than you'd expect with a black and white camera. It is very effective in giving you a view from a dark room -- without visibly lighting the room.* Set up involves pressing some buttons on the camera, switching your phone/tablet to the wifi network of the camera, creating an account, switching your wifi back to your home router. The camera appears in a list. If you have only one Motorola camera, you will only see one.BETTER FOR BELKIN:* Sharper image* Clearer night view* Wider angle (though the narrower angle of the Motorola is compensated by the ability to tilt/pan).* Much clearer, simpler manual.* Better looking camera, smaller box.BETTER FOR MOTOROLA BLINK1:* Belkin app does NOT work on the iPad.* You can tilt and pan the camera from your phone/tablet* If a scene is illuminated (bright), the camera switches to a color video view. (not b&w; IR).* Faster, nearly real-time video if you are on your home network. Not as good as facetime, but basically realtime. The Belkin is only 2 fps.* Stays connected. The Belkin auto-disconnects and you have to tap the screen and reconnect.----Personal preference: Although they both have flaws, I prefer the Belkin even though the specs are actually worse and it's a worse app. The Belkin is cheaper, and for the same money I could get two Belkins, which would be even better than a motorized Motorola.Also note the Belkin app for the camera does not support the Belkin WeMo Wi-Fi Baby Monitor for Apple iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch (Firmware Update), so you'd have to switch to that app to use a WeMo.", "Date": "May 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "When it works, it's great...", "Author": "VeeeeryInteresting", "ReviewID": "R1FAJGWBAXDWI8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "When it works, which is spotty at best, it works great.

The people are very nice and well scripted to be so (after hearing the exact same apology repeated by different people many times) but they are, in my opinion, completely incompetant! They always put me on hold for a \"level 2 or 3  tech rep\" and then come back and state that none are available but will call back. I never get the call backs and when I callled last I was told the same. I then made such a stink that they reached out to their \"very most senior tech rep\" who once she got on the line turned out to be one of the \"level 2\" reps with whom I had spoken 3 days before who said she needed to get me to a more senior tech rep and promised they would call within 48 hours....of course they never did. I give up. DO NOT BUY BELKIN products and EVER expect any technical support. Nice people who are not competant are almost more frustrating than the rude ones. The last person even told me that the later HD version worked much better but she could not offer me an exchange for that one even if I paid the difference - she could however offer me an exchange for the same poor quality older model if I paid the shipping - all of this after I finally asked about a replacement. She, nor any of the prior 6 or 7 \"customer support\" people I spoke with over a 10 day period since purchasing the netcam, ever brought up the replacement option until I asked about it.

I set the camera aside, and many months later I've gotten back to it, a few revisions of the iOS app later, and whatever other improvements have been made on the central server. And much has changed; it's surprisingly useful and easy to use to the point I've raised my rating from 2 stars to 4.Hardware is decent. I especially like its dark room performance, where everything in a small dark room is discernible. There is significant latency; point it at yourself and it takes a couple seconds to register movements. So don't expect any useful two way communication, unless you want to simulate a mission to the Moon. Picture quality is quite good for a security camera.The app has progressed nicely works OK on both my iPhone 5 and my iPad Mini, although the app is not tablet optimized. I'm glad that Belkin has iterated on it. Launch time and time to seeing the video stream is still slower than I would like: it can take upwards of 10 seconds sometimes to actually see a video stream, although it will occasionally lock up awaiting the camera.  There is still room for improvement, but it isn't the mess it once was.Don't forget the username you provide Belkin's web portal, as you'll need both it and your e-mail address to reset the password on the account.I was able to use a Power Over Ethernet Adapter set to 5V to power the camera without the mess of a nearby wall wart.I took a trip to China recently, and this would have been useful to keep myself comforted my house was secure.
