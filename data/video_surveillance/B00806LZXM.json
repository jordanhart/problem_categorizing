{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great for what i expected! includes audio also", "Author": "justabuyer", "ReviewID": "R3C8I8M0MGTJBD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "first off I am just a novice, i have installed several systems all several years apart so the technology was improved with each install. regarding this one;this unit was very easy to setup was as simple as plug in, power on, connect to tv. The unit needs no \"setup\" walk thru before use, it automatically detects camera input and will show it on the corresponding channel it is connected to. By default it is set to record all channels all the time which for 16 channels means you will fill up the 1tb drive in less than 2 weeks.Pros;came with everything needed for install, all the cable for cameras, mounting hardware and power sources.very simple initial setup - if all you do is plug in and power on then you are automatically recording.unit has 2 usb inputs in front and 2 in back - great for backup drivescameras included are weatherproof, infrared and have a microphone these cameras are surprisingly good quality for a \"kit\" camera.you can access from the internet however it requires a little more than just plug and play, we needed to get a static ip address from the internet providerYou can set to record when camera senses motion, there is a delay of about 1 sec.camera sensitivity can be adjusted for motion detection, you need to test this after instal, it is set to level 2 by default which was not sensitive enough we moved to a 1 which was good.Cons;cannot change the recording quality to maximize recording spaceunit only sizes to a certain resolution which means if using a hdtv there may be black spaces on each side of the screenso far i cannot find how to have the cameras scroll on screen at certain intervals, i am manually using the remote to view 4 cameras at a time.in closing:i do recommend this kit as it was easy to install, setup  and record, just make sure you measure out distance ahead of time so you have correct cable lengths ready for your install", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "DVR No Longer Works", "Author": "Gary Fortelney", "ReviewID": "R1TH9F4RID787Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased the ZModo 16 channel 1TB package 01/17/12.  After about 5 months the unit stopped working, the internal fans would come on but the system board would not power up, and the power light would not come on.  I contacted the manufacturer and they sent out a replacement unit (they tried to talk me into a downgraded replacement unit with no hdmi port).  This unit worked for 13 months and the same thing happened to this one.  I did have a name brand surge protector they plugged into also.  I would highly recommend another DVR manufacturer that offers a 3 or 5 year warranty over the 1 year warranty ZModo offers, odds are your unit will go out within a year or so.  I ended up purchasing a new DVR from a different manufacturer that has a 3 year warranty at less cost than the ZModo.", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "problem with feeds always connecting", "Author": "MyPC Solutions", "ReviewID": "R3QEJNAMGOFTH6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So I have had this for a few months now and I am not really too happy. I have all 16 channels hooked up, and I randomly get the \"connecting\" message with the feed going solid blue. The wires are not touching anything electric, nor are they near any lights or EMI.

It was easy to set up, the dvr works fantastic, and  15 of the 16 cameras work great. The only shortfall was straight out of the box, one camera did not work.
