I ended up switching to the Agasio A603W (and purchased four of them through Amaazon).  The Foscam FI8904W has 24 IR LEDs; the Agasio A603W has 36 IR LEDs.  The Foscam FI8904W's outdoor daylight picture is washed out due to the IR's; the Agasio A603W has an IR-cut filter, thereby delivering daylight pictures in full color.  The Foscam FI8904W is prone to water leaking in unless the antenna remains extremely tight at all times; the sealing system of Agasio A603W is independent of the tightness of the antenna and is far superior.  Although the Agasio A603W is slightly more expensive, it is a much better designed ipcam than the Foscam FI8904W.  No, I am not a salesperson.  I am not affiliated with either company in any way and never have been.  I am simply a regular purchaser.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Does What It Claims", "Author": "Mr Plow", "ReviewID": "R3P8VBM89CFKST", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought two of these Agasio A603W's and added them to an existing outdoor surveillance system (six Trendnet IP Cams - two TV-IP301W, four TV-IP100W) running on Blue Iris for a couple of years.  All cams are mounted outdoors some wireless, some direct (mostly to capture video of wild animals i.e. bear, mtn lions).  I use Blue Iris to record motion-triggered video files to local in-home PC (older Vista machine), I do not use the capability to monitor cams remotely via internet (poor internet connection).No trouble setting up the Agasio's, worked fine wirelessly.  Discovered that 5 wireless cams was too much for my 801.11 b/g-only wireless network (all cams slowed down, especially the remote ones at the barn ~175' away from the house via a wireless range extender), so I wound up running CAT-5 cable and connecting to the Agasio's directly via ethernet (each is mounted on the exterior of the house within 25' of a switch). I've been operating them continuously for about a month now and have had zero dropouts.The reason I bought the A603W is because its claimed features are very similar to the Trendnet TV-IP301W (wireless, auto-iris, IR LED for night vision) but the Agasio A603W is 1/3 the cost.  Another big plus for the Agasio is the outdoor rating (I had to put my 301's in an outdoor camera enclosure).  I also like the fact that the Agasio's video image colors appear normal during daytime due to the IR cut-off filter (greens appear as pink/ gray on the Trendnet).My biggest disappointment with the Agasio's is that the image quality is not as good as the Trendnet.  Even though both are 640x480, the Trendnet has a feature that enables you to select among 3 different levels of video quality (better quality, higher bandwidth required).  There's no ability to select video quality on the Agasio.  The Agasio images just aren't as clean and crisp as the Trendnet's, almost like they're a little out of focus.  If there is a way to adjust the focus on the Agasio, it's not obvious - the documentation doesn't say you can, and the lens is behind the glass front.  My guess is that if a car drove by 30' away from the Agasio you couldn't read the license plate.The Agasio does one other weird thing - at certain times it will switch back and forth between a normal exposure and a darker exposure - about once a second - it can go on for many minutes.  I think it has something to do with the ambient light level, i.e. maybe it gets a little confused if the light is slowly diminishing so it keeps switching between auto-iris settings.  It is mostly annoying and results in a lot of false-triggers on the motion videos.*****Update August 16, 2012The good thing is that both units have operated continuously with no video dropouts for the last 4 months (one is wired,the other wireless) and there's no evidence of water/ moisture inside.  The bad news is that the IR lights have quit working at night on one of the units.  Also, both units still do the weird exposure switching described above (I am hoping Agasio releases a firmware update that might fix this, but they don't appear to be keeping their website updated).  The night vision isn't great, maybe 20-25 feet at the most.*****Update December 7, 2013I can't believe it, both are still operating.  Have been outdoors continuously in wind/ rain/ heat/ snow/ cold (-15F to 100F).  Both still have the auto-iris flickering problem during the day as many have noted - thought for sure that Agasio would have issued a firmware update to fix this long ago.  Not happy with the IR brightness at night, seems to be worse than when new, can't see more than 20' from camera at night.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works as expected.

We used it to supplement a Trendnet TV-IP110W on the opposite side of the house.Here's my thoughts:Color: Daytime color (especially greens) is correct as they advertise. Personally this isn't really that important of a point with me, but both my Trendnet, and several Foscam 8918 don't have this feature. This is one of the main selling points on this camera but I really don't care that much.Focus: not that impressive. Out of the box the camera is clearly out of focus. Not badly, but you can't help but notice it. The focus on the much older Trendnet is significantly better. For those who haven't found it out elsewhere, it is possible to adjust the focus but you have to mostly disassemble the camera to do it. There is an internal screw that has to be removed to adjust the lens focus. Amazon won't let me post a link, but if you google \"foscam FI8905W VIDEO TUTORIAL CHANGING THE LENS\" the first link shows how to disassemble the camera. You don't need to actually remove the lens, but you need to dismantle the camera to the point that you could remove it. Specially, you need to remove the screw that goes in perpendicular to the lens that holds the focus. Once you remove it, you can screw the lens to adjust the focus. Bear in mind, I still wasn't able to get the focus perfect after doing all this but it did improve.Night vision: very good. The trendnet is in an outdoor enclosure (also by trendnet) but it is basically useless at night. We just ordered a second Agasio A603W to replace it as a result. While not excellent, it is more than adequate even at a distance. The 50ft claim is believable.If you are expecting to read news print at 50 feet in pitch blackness from a $100 camera, you'll probably be disappointed. If you have reasonable expectations, you'll be happy. One thing I did notice though, we had a 3-bulb lamppost in our front yard and with it on at night the 3 lights tended to overpower the shot quite a bit. The image was much better after turning it off.Lens: the 4mm viewing angle is decent and covers a nice area.Setup: I had no problems setting the camera up at all. It came with a preset IP in the 192.168.1.X range unlike my foscams so I didn't need the installer cd to set it up. In fact, the default IP, username, and PW were actually on a sticker right on the camera so I didn't even need to open the manual or consult any setup guide.Other notes:The camera got condensation on the inside of the screw-on cover the other day. The camera was in a spot where a sprinkler was hitting it and I noticed that the cover wasn't screwed on fully when I disassembled it to adjust the focus. Time will tell as to whether it happens again now (the sprinkler has been moved.) Update: Several months later the camera seems to be fine. No reoccurance.Also, if you need to set the camera up on any software, you can identify it as a Foscam FI8905W. The Foscam is the nearly-identical sibling camera to the A603W (though there is the side note that: I haven't actually changed the lens on this camera myself, but supposedly the lens in the Agasio is NOT a standard CCTV lens unlike the Foscam. The lens it comes with works fine for me though.) This setting worked fine for IP Cam Viewer for the Android.Support: can't say I've had to call Agasio yet, so I can't vouch for tech support one way or the other. Based on other reviews, if tech support is a big thing for you, I wouldn't expect much.----------------------Updated May 27, 2014Back in December I had a camera fail after a year and a half and so I ordered a replacement. Now, the replacement has also failed only 6 months later. Haven't had a chance to try and get it warranted yet; from what I've read, I'm not expecting it to go smoothly.

It has a cheap-yet-adequate aluminum housing that allows the camera to be fairly lightweight for its size.  The housing has a shiny silver appearance that will not be adequate for discrete applications, if that is required.The camera has a connector for a detachable wireless antenna and a cable that contains an RJ-45 jack, a reset button, and the power adapter connector.  The power adapter is about the same size as what you would find in a cell-phone wall charger.Included with the camera is a wall mount bracket and a CD.  When my package arrived, the CD was broken and unusable.  The wall mount bracket is suitable in my opinion only as a wall mount bracket - if mounted to a ceiling, the camera would likely hang at a strange angle.I am tech savvy and was unable to get connected to the camera without first installing the camera software found on Agasio's website.  This is probably because the camera is preconfigured to operate on a different gateway via a static IP (192.168.1.99) than my router (192.168.0.*).  Setup using the camera software was easy and once it was up, I could access the camera from anywhere inside my LAN.  Providing WAN access will be easy, when I can get around to it.*** There are a few minor details that leads me to believe that this camera may perhaps be a knock-off or unauthorized reproduction as warned in the Agasio documentation found on their website.  Buyer Beware. ***  However, I still stand by my 4-star rating because the camera seems to function how it is intended and is of sufficient quality to hang on to.The video quality is adequate and night view distance is good.  As mentioned in a previous review for this camera, I doubt that details, such as a License Plate number, will be clearly visible with this camera.", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't buy from Agasio - NO TECH SUPPORT LIKE ADVERTISED", "Author": "Cornelius5454", "ReviewID": "R2UQJMHE9ADEVY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Look - I think the product is absolutely great for price and it works very well once you spend hours figuring out how to get it setup.  I bought it direct from the Agasio.us site (same outfit as Foscam.us), because they offered unparalleled tech support and all this other hogwash.  However, they will not answer the phone and will only talk to you if you pay $39.99 to have the \"remote install\" the camera.  I messed around trying to go wireless, port forward, all the other stuff for hours, when literally a 5 minute tech phone call would have answered the question (phone support was promised by the website if you bought directly from them!!).  Their tech support is a SCAM and all the bad reviews on the website are deleted or not posted, trust me I know.  The only thing they did was forward me a link to an installation video on the real Foscam.com site, which wouldn't even load.Additionally, the software with the Agasio is inferior to the Foscam - there are issues where you constantly have to delete the browsing history to get it to work and it constantly displays \"Page cannot be displayed\" errors. - As a note, it will actually save the settings even though it says this and you have to keep going back to live video and then back to settings.  If you are having issues, esp with passwords, delete your browsing history and this sometimes solves the problem.  However, while I love the product, buy it cheaper from a Amazon seller (although even thru their website, it is filled thru Amazon - so make sure you know who you are buying it from).  Great product, but don't pay the extra $10 bucks thinking you're going to get jack for tech support.They also refused to respond to any questions that I sent via email requesting to speak with a tech representative and would not respond to voicemails - you'll get an answer immediately if you pay the $40 bucks for some guy to take 5 minutes and setup it up remotely.

(Each of the two cost about $90 at the time I bought them.) After setting up all four units, I cannot stress how different these two models are.First off: they clearly are based off the same firmware. The menu options, choices, and images are all the same (even though they have a different color scheme and logo in the administrative panel). However, despite having software controls for panning and scanning, the Agasio has no ability to actually DO these things. Fine; no worries... I may have misread the description in that regard, and actually I was quite comfortable having a fixed-position unit. They could've at least removed these menu items, though. Far more egregious, however, is the distinct lack of polish on the Agasio's interface. Whereas the 8910W had a clean and functional software interface, the Agasio had menus that drop 50 pixels to the left of the button you've clicked on, a TON of grammatical and spelling errors, and strange, \"Engrish\" option descriptions that made everything difficult to navigate until I used the FINISHED version of the same software (that came with the other model). Many of the options didn't work AT ALL (like the wireless, which has the exact same interface as the Foscam, and was set up the same way, but DIDN'T WORK on the Agasio... or, secondly, things like the on-screen text, which also did NOTHING when you clicked on it.) Unfortunately, since it's web-based, you can't use the Foscam's GOOD software to control the crappy Agasio.However, the real sticking points were two-fold: 1) the picture quality on the Agasio is below laughable. It's practically worthless. It's grainy, washed-out (which was what I was trying to AVOID by choosing the TRUE COLOR image model), and it would --never-- pass muster if you needed to use it in a legal situation. Even the crappy display wasn't an issue for very long, though, because WITHIN THE FIRST TWENTY MINUTES OF SETTING IT UP, THE AGASIO STOPPED WORKING ENTIRELY. I can still get to the web page, so I know it's accessible, and I can still change some settings, but the video feed just shows up black.The bottom line is, this Agasio camera has not only been a complete waste of money... but between the two models, it also killed about an hour and a half of my time. If I wasn't very technically-savvy (with over a decade of professional technical field service experience) or didn't know the interface front-to-back (after setting up the VERY similar Foscam model), it could have easily wasted a day or more of my time. You don't need that kind of heartache. DO NOT buy this model.

Shipped from the same office address and looks identical.The embedded web-server on the A603W is different from the Foscam, and a bit needing update. (I'll get to that.) The A603W camera is easy to set up, but, like them all, to access from a remote (such as a smartphone)this camera requires you to have some experience and TLC with your router (port-forwarding and pin-hole or DMZ routing, each of which is different on every router.) [...] and/or [...] have some assistance in setting up the routers. Still, it is a pain.Importantly, this camera has an IR-Cut Filter. I can't underestimate its importance. I would NOT buy any day/night camera without one (because I already own one and it is horrible.) I understand from Foscam Customer support that all their day/night cameras now have an IR-Cut Filter, but I haven't verified. (I asked because I my OLD Foscam day/night camera from about 5 years ago does NOT have one)This Agasio camera is compatible with the Foscam cameras. It has the same API and command interface. On my Android smartphone I use (and love) tinyCamMonitor (free or paid) and set the Agasio up as a Foscam FI8905W, and it works perfectly.  Also, the camera itself (both Agasio and Foscam), has software built into its own web-server to view up to 9 cameras (but only using IE as the browser).  This camera web-server software can only work with Foscam, or Foscam-compatible cameras.  It works fine on the Foscam with Agasio, and vice-versa.As to the Web-interface, the Agasio is slightly different from Foscam's most recent update.  The Agasio is the original software and there are currently no updates. Although they are virtually identical, functionally, there seem to be a few \"features\" missing from the Agasio:1. Each camera lets you have the camera send you an email if motion is detected at the camera, which is why I have the cameras.  This functionality can be scheduled (so,e.g., you only have it on at night).  The Foscam interface, you can set (or clear) each hour of all days with a single click.  On the Agasio, it requires 2-clicks per hour per day, or, i.e., a LOT of clicks, to get what you want. Trivial update, but not yet.2. When using a browser other than IE on the Agasio, you cannot change the brightness, contrast, or frames/second speed of the camera.  You need to use IE to do that.  I'd call that a bug, to be fixed, no doubt.3. The menu is not as intuitive on the Agasio as on the Foscam.Otherwise, these cameras appear identical.  Prices seem to be within $5-10 of each other.

The support person acknowledged the problem and they have a UI update on their site.

Generally they're really easy to set up.  It goes like this:1. plug the camera into your wired network and power on2. log into your router to see what IP address it picked up3. type in that IP in your browser4. type \"admin\" for username and leave the password field blank to log in5. make your necessary configuration changes (add password, configure wireless, etc.) and save6. once configured, unplug wired connection, power-cycle the camera, make sure it's accessible wirelessly, then place camera in desired locationUsually the configuration portion is less than 5 minutes.  However, this camera I received did not work this way.  First, it had a sticker on the bottom of the camera stating its IP is 192.168.1.99:99.  That was weird, but I was able to connect to it anyway by reconfiguring my computer to be on the same network as it.  I was able to log into the camera through its web GUI, but that's as far as I got.  Using Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer, I was not able to configure its network settings.  The drop down menus did not work.  I opened up a console and checked the code for the webpage and sure enough, a bunch of errors.  I have a feeling this camera's issues are a fluke, so I'm going to give another one a try.Bottom line, I'm glad I bought this from Amazon (fulfilled by Amazon) and I'm able to return this defective one and get a replacement.

Motion detection is very limited and is difficult to set to avoid false alerts.  The picture (while acceptable) always seems to be just the slightest bit out of focus to me.

Apparently this is common for this tier  of SKU but still seems to me it could be better. Overall, I am happy with the camera. However, I didn't like the software built into the camera. I installed a 3rd party solution called \"Blue Iris\" which is amazing! It has options to help overcome some of the aforementioned problems and is in a league of it's own.

I emailed tech support (since calling does not seem to work) and I got a response that said \"the outdoor cameras do not have auto brightness adjustment\".  I wrote back and pointed out that their listing here on Amazon indicates that it does have this capability.  I have not heard back from them since.The nighttime LED is very good.  My driveway is about 60 feet long and I can see to the end of it at night with very little trouble.Overall, I like the camera for the price.

After three or four tries, you can program one to your home system in no time. I should know; I've set up three. You can get software that will easily manage all your cameras' video. But here are some of the problems Foscam doesn't highlight.1) These cameras require a lot of wireless bandwidth. If you want three or four, you'll probably have to replace your router with a higher-performance router, especially if you're using an outdoor camera  like this one.2) If you replace your router with a newer, faster Wireless N router, you may find that although your router also supports wireless G, in that mode it's not faster than your old router, and may even be slower. Its only in wireless N mode that it achieves full performance. This was my experience with new Netgear and Linksys Wireless N routers.3) If your camera is outside and separated from your router by two or three walls and a tiled roof or a gutter (if, for instance, your router is in the center of your house and you've mounted your camera at the front of your garage) you'll be lucky to get any image at all, never mind a good one.4) If you're buying from Foscam like I did, don't listen to their recommendation that you buy one of their range extenders. The antennas don't help unless there's a clear line-of-sight, and the one wireless access point/range extender they offer is out of stock. (That's advertised only on their website.) They won't stop you from buying it, but when, two weeks later, you ask them what happened to the extender, and they tell you it's out of stock, then offer you a lesser extender, don't expect to get a refund pronto. I've opened a dispute on PayPal to get my money back from Foscam, and it looks as if they are letting the clock run out on the dispute.5) Other wifi access point range extenders may work, but you may still have a bandwidth problem.6) The changes that Foscam advises you to make to Windows Internet Explorer's Internet Options, so that you can run the camera's web client in Internet Explorer, may be dangerous, and could result in malware invading your computer. If you don't believe me, try it and read the IE warnings.All of this has caused me to look elsewhere for a wireless security camera solution.

I mean pitiful.  Plan on buying a ethernet over power adapter.Wiring- I have no idea why the cable for this camera does not seem removable.  I didn't sit and study it, but there should be a small connector on the camera so I do not have to drill a hole large enough to fit an ethernet port through.Mount- what is this junk?  I think a coke can with some duct tape would be more stable.The good:It's quality is impressive.  I can easily distinguish faces and animals day and night.  The IR's do their job and they do it well.It plays well with the synolgy disk station series.I would recommend this camera, but save yourself some troubles and time and go with the FOS.... and here's my original review:I want to love this camera.  It works.  It has terrible wifi reception, but it works.  It just has some history I wasn't prepared for.So happy_customer, why the long face when you leave the review?Well, internet friends, I have a problem knowing I paid an extra fee for a rebranded camera.  Yes! It's true!  I thought I made a mistake at first, but the more I looked into it, the more I realized this camera is just a rebadged version of another one on this website.  Now, don't get me wrong, I still got a camera that works just the same as if I had bought the \"real\" version, but I would have saved about a tank worth of gas in the civc if I didn't go for the rebranded model.But happy_customer, maybe you paid for the support and documentation available for the camera!No, internet.  It took me a while to configure this thing.  Any time the documentation recommends how to get a paid product for free and is written in.... well it's just poor.But happy_customer, how do you KNOW that you got a rebranded camera?This is a sad but true story, internet.  You see, the people that packaged my camera decided they wouldn't even try to trick me into believing I hadn't overpaid for a couple pieces of metal, optic sensors, and ir led's.  No, instead they wanted to rub it in my face and put a sticker with the wrong model number on it.  I cried for a while knowing what they had done to me.  After recording most my crying in the dark with these fancy ir lights, I decided I would write a review here.What's next for this little camera, you ask?  I don't know.  I'll banish it to the elements and see how she does for a while.  If it holds up I guess I'll keep her around.  If not, I'll throw her rebranded rear in the \"dead tech\" pile and recycle it to recoup some of my unbranded money.Oh, did I mention its rebranded?", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Foscam customer service issue", "Author": "Lisa \"Liz\"", "ReviewID": "R23QW51W0U994N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I think that that the product is good but it is very frustrating to get a hold of a technician to help you with the installation process.
