Good option for accidental lock out or emergency entry. The items I received were a little more white on the raised surfaces than the one pictured. Realism probably depends on the color of rocks in your region or around your house. A point about the product I wanted to make was that the bottom does not have an attached door that rotates open to house the key and then swings back to cover it up again. This rock has a cover that fits around the inside of the cavity to hold it on and slides entirely out made of a pretty flimsy plastic. If you lose the cover, you're out of luck.

I've bought it for other people, however this product arrived broken in the mail. The edges were broken into little pieces. I glued them back on because the price + shipping for this product wouldn't be worth it shipping back and going through all this trouble.

Its just enough room to fit a key or too. The outside is real looking from a distance but once you get closer to it, you will see how it does not really look real. The white plastic piece on the bottom shows a little from the bottom when the rock is on the ground.Overall its a great little thing to have when you want to keep a key around but you might want to make sure no one will inspect it and notice its a fake.

I recently needed a rock when I found out that my boyfriend was sleeping with one of the secretaries at his office. My (now ex) boyfriend also drove a really nice sports car, on which he did not quite have enough insurance coverage. Since until recently he received his mail at my house, I was well aware of this.  I discovered his infidelity while doing laundry one day. I noticed that his shirt smelled suspiciously of Chanel, which I do not wear. In the pocket of his slacks, I found a note from \"Sharon,\" thanking him for a wonderful lunch hour and bragging about how he put a run in her stockings, which she had difficulty removing because she was so cramped from the lack of space in his back seat \"te he he\".  Infuriated, I did not have time to procure a real rock. I grabbed the \"hide a key\" rock, and got into my car to drive over there. I saw his car; red, recently waxed, and otherwise gorgeous.  I had no trouble smashing all the windows in at all. It didn't even dent the Hide A Key! As a matter of fact, the impact caused the key (which was his) to fly out at one point during the vandalism, and it conveniently slipped into a storm drain. Since he can no longer enter the house, I decided to throw all his belongings on the lawn.
