{"Reviews": [{"Title": "You get BETTER than what you pay for.", "Author": "Swim Rabbit", "ReviewID": "R3EFD3MTTASP1B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I\u2019m surprised the previous reviews were so negative.  I think these cameras have a great quality/price ratio.  But they are still inexpensive cameras\u2026 so keep that in mind.I bought these to upgrade the 400 TVL cameras that came with the original system.  Those cameras weren\u2019t great; (as stated in other reviews) day time color was poor, night vision washed out, but I knew that what I was buying was entry level equipment, and yet I\u2019ve still been happy overall with the system.  The HD DVR is very good, it was easy to set-up, has manageable software, and on the two occasions I needed to contact Night Owl with technical questions, I was plenty satisfied with the customer service.Now that I have these 600 TVL cameras, I\u2019m even more satisfied.  Day time color is true and clear, night vision is significantly further and sharper.  Remember that the LED\u2019s work like a flashlight.  Shine any light out into empty darkness and you won\u2019t see much no matter how bright it is.  Those LED\u2019s need to reflect off of something to work well.  I now have a new camera on the side of the house pointing at a brick wall 70\u2019 away.  On the monitor the back yard is well covered in even in full dark.  The front yard doesn\u2019t have much to reflect off in the distance except the lawn, so I do get washout past 40\u2019, but I\u2019m thinking that issue could be solved with an infrared illuminator mounted and aimed farther out onto the yard.  I\u2019ve read other reviews about annoying static on the monitor when the ambient light changes and the sensor is flickering the LED\u2019s on an off.  I have noticed this as well, but it only seems to last a minute (until the light has changed enough to keep the sensor static) and is a tolerable inconvenience when remembering the quality/price ratio.These cameras are not high-end.  Don\u2019t expect high-end cameras and you won\u2019t be disappointed.  There are plenty of cameras out there for hundreds of dollars apiece that will have sharper color, wider fields of vision, and a 100 meters of night vision instead of just up to 100\u2019.  But these cameras are built well, are easy to mount and aim (especially while viewing on a Smart Phone), and for my needs, they have more than enough quality for the great price.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very poor  image quality", "Author": "CL94538", "ReviewID": "R369QX3TCZYNU9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The title speaks for itself, bought a pack from Fry's and mounted them and am extremely disappointed with the image quality - 600TVL - really??. My stock 420TVL cameras produced way better images. The only plus is the LEDs are bright, images still blur but brighter than my stock cameras.

There is a definite improvement in the color and clarity of the camera, especially day time viewing .At Night time it does a decent job and the range is good .

I purchased this package and am ecstatic with the results. Granted the picture quality is not up to the standards of some cameras (most of which cost twice as much for one as these four combined) but it was a marked improvement over the cameras that came with my system. For an inexpensive system that covers my entire residence I strongly recommend them!", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Inexpensive and inexpensive result", "Author": "M.

Guess I should have expected what I paid for, 4 cheap cameras that are not as good as the cameras that came with my DVR.  After hooking up all 4, the LED's were not satisfactory to identify trespassers or animals close to the house in dark conditions.  Imagery in daylight conditions was blurry. They are at the top of my replacement list.  Wish I had asked for a refund.
