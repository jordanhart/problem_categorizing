The only issue I have is that ALL the stickers have to be hung from the outside except the auto stickers, you can hang those from the inside. My package only came with 3 large stickers. That was a disappointment because I was giving 2 away to my mother and saving 2 for myself... The package came in a plastic mailing envelope that had a sheet of stock like paper to keep the stickers from getting bent. However the corner of the stock paper was bent due to the flimsy plastic envelope it was mailed in, My items weren't bent or damaged but were almost due to that 'stock paper ' being bent and wrinkled on the corner. That was the only protection for the stickers. I would just suggest that the company send it in a thick paper/cardboard mailing envelope, to ensure that they don't get bent.... other than that Im very pleased with the product. The quality and the product look like they are from a real security company. These can be used in business with actual live video or in homes wanting to bluff having a security system and video..", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0094AUING"}}
