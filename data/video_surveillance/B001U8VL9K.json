This camera is sturdy, durable, crystal clear, sees in the darkness, and easily adjustable.  Basically I got a complete surveillance system for little more than the price of this camera and the 17 bucks for the capture card.Only downside is no PTZ.  But I wasn't even looking for that and don't care about it.( I forgot to mention one thing... I would advise you buy the 100 ft VideoSecu power and video cable on this site... it comes with the adapter you need as well.

It is a good value for the money.  The resolution is pretty good, especially for distance less than 30 feet.  Beyond that it is a little vague.  The IR illumination is ok, but close objects end up washed out and more distant objects are not visible at all.  Installation was pretty easy, but there were no real instructions at all and no template for the mounting holes.  The mounting holes are ALMOST just the right size to mount to a standard ceiling box.  I would not consider this mounting to be vandal proof, as it can be moved, disconnected and re-aimed form outside with no tools.  The camera seems pretty resistant to fogging and operates well at all the temperatures we have encountered so far.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Cam", "Author": "Gus", "ReviewID": "R3TB6LR1MXDTHB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this cam to deter our local gas thieves, so was only concerned about its night vision.

But the camera angel was not wide enough for the area I wanted coverage on. This camera was my answer. It covered the entire front yard from a high point on a single story home. The video footage is on par or slightly less that that of a standard video camera. Plus the viewing quality was much better that the cameras the DVR system came with (again I did not buy the DVR System at Amazon). Which to me is perfect for the average single story budget strapped homeowner. I like how the housing covers the wiring to prevent someone tampering with it. It is much less noticeable than the bullet style. You can even paint the housing to match your house color. Overall I was happy with the camera's performance & price that I bought another one.You might need extra cables or adapters depending on your setup & use. I ended up needing a male BNC to Female Video RCA adapter to work with my set up. Have fun!I haven't had a chance to view it's night vision ability but I'm sure it's will be fine.

Wallace", "ReviewID": "R2KJMRZ0S92OXN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've worked in the security industry a long time.  I've seen a lot of bad cheap cameras.  This, is a GREAT cheap camera.The IR does not splash back into the lens, this is because the glass over the lens is independent from the glass over the IR LEDs.  It's not the cheesy foam ring around the lens setup, this is truly 2 sets of glass (The right way to do it, and rare on a cheap camera)The LED illumination is quite evenly spread out, and reaches effectively about 25' or so in my experience so far, without a hard hot spot in the middle.The IRs and the camera imager processing are adjusted to be really well in tune with each other.The lens FOV is about 85+ degrees (almost 90 degrees) from the glass.It is a turret dome design, with all metal housing, with the outer ring that screws down over the base to hold the ball in place.  It is a 4 piece design.  (base, ring, hood, ball)  It goes together very easily.Low noise, good color, good light sensitivity.Bonus, it includes the power adapter and surveillance warning sticker that pro installers don't care about, but consumer end-users will appreciate.Cons:  Screwing down the hood secures the camera fine, but not from a vandal resistant stand point.  Some can still easily grab and turn the camera to a different angle (it's not super tight).  So if it's in a public place, mount it out of reach.The cable is not sealed where it enters the ball housing.  (during assembly the cable has to move through the back)  I solved this by adding some silicon around where the cable enters the ball to keep ambient moisture out.  easy.  The rest of it seems pretty water resistant.There is some minor vignetting but it's not too dramatic.  (slightly darker areas in the corners of the image)Bang for the buck, you can't beat this.

Do not let the low price fool you, this is a great camera.I live just to the left of nowhere, and need to take full responsibility for the safety and security of my family. So when I built my house I planned out and installed a multi-camera DVR. In total I have 13 cameras surrounding my house and 3 inside. Some of the cameras are the cheap ones that came with the DVR. When one wore out I replaced it with this model. WOW, what a difference it makes. The colors are accurate, the field of vision is great (about 110\u00b0-120\u00b0) and the night vision is remarkable. This one was installed at my front door and the infrared illumination is so bright that I can pick it up on other cameras out front. I liked it so much that I bought 2 more and installed them in my kids rooms instead of the crappy baby monitors. I just bought my 4th and installed it in the living room to use as a nanny cam. I can not recommend these enough.By the way, I also have a $100 camera installed over my driveway that has more 600 TV lines, (I wanted to be able to read license plates) and the image quality of the Video Secure camera is nearly identical, for about 1/3 the cost.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love this camera.

The image from the camera is crisp and clear, in both night and day settings.  I prefer wide-angle lenses for use in home surveillance so I was happy that it shipped with one.  IR lights are visible to the naked eye, but are definitely powerful enough.  They lit up a 25ft long room with no problems at all.  I'm glad this unit ships with a CCD instead of a CMOS chip, as the quality of the image is so much better!The housing is decent, though it feels like the paint can chip off easily.  It ships with the tool you need to adjust the bracket.  The bracket itself is a bit cumbersome to use, since you end up fighting yourself when you screw it all together.  I had to have the camera plugged in to figure out which way was up (the photo-resistor is at bottom of the screen) since there are no markings.Unlike many other cameras, this one did not include a cable to hook into your DVR.  I don't find that to be a problem, but it will add to the cost of the camera.Because it uses 12V, you should be able to use a computer to power the camera.  At 500ma, it shouldn't be much of an issue for your computer's power supply, and you'll eliminate a ground loop error in the process.", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not as good as I'd hoped for", "Author": "Marypearl \"Marypearl\"", "ReviewID": "R305QYQBXIW1C7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Camera shows black and white in the daytime.

I used this as my main camera view in a 8 camera setup. The other 7 are standard camera's that came in a Night Owl Kit. This camera has standard connections and should fit many other vendors power connections. BNC connections are standard across all vendors so no issue there.The transformer is included, but I hooked the power line up to my existing kit's power line. It just needs 1 power and 1 BNC connection. No microphone. I would recommend a separate microphone only setup independent of the camera.This camera is not vandal proof. All you need to do is twist the upper ring and the entire piece comes off. No camera is vandal proof, unless you mount it somewhere very high where no one can reach it. In that case, every camera is vandal proof because it's unreachable.", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "VERY good for the bucks", "Author": "BEWARE OF BUYING FROM:GLORIA HOYOS ON AMAZON....", "ReviewID": "R1U8FZIY544HE5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a VERY GOOD camera for the money.If anyone has ever bought the cd33w-2 from super circuitsthis looks to be the very same cam at $30 less then you canget it from super circuits. super circuits sells good stuffbut between both of these cams for $30 less y not save the money.", "Date": "May 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for the Money", "Author": "Livin' Life", "ReviewID": "R2G9Q2JY9TN303", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm very impressed.

This camera has a wide viewing area, displays colors nicely, and makes the transition to night vision as expected.

The overall clarity is good, but at distances over 10 to 15 feet, you cannot make out a person's face.  I'm unable to  identify my own face unless I'm close enough to the camera.  This camera works better for \"was someone on my property\" and not \"who was that person on my property\".  However, the camera is clear enough for large objects such as cars at distances of around 30 feet.  I use this particular camera over my front door aimed down at the steps, and for this purpose it works good.

There is not enough room between the camera and the mounting base to \"tuck\" the BNC/power connectors, extra length of cable, etc.  The cable off the camera is maybe 12-18 inches long so I simply bundled everything up inside the garage.As far as image quality, I would say that daytime performance is \"as expected\" and nighttime performance is \"below expectations\".
