{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Hard to Set Up, but Still a Good Camera", "Author": "R. Adams \"Ms. Adams\"", "ReviewID": "RZROMMKSEC2ZE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been wanting the D-Link DCS-5222L camera since it was first announced and waited months for it to be available.  I purchased the DCS-932L last year and loved it, but I really wanted something that panned and tilted, so this was exactly what I was looking for.  Since setting up the DCS-932L was a breeze for me, I thought this one would be the same deal.  It was the total opposite of that.I tried setting it up with the included CD and was able to get through the entire install process up until the very last step.  That step asks if you want to log in with your current MyDLink account info, if you want to create one, or if you decline.  I entered my credentials numerous times and then it would just hang.  Nothing happened.  I reread the directions several times, tried redoing the install process several times, then started searching DLink forums for the answer.  It was when I searched the forums that I became aware that numerous people had issues linking another camera to their already existing account.  I couldn't find any solutions to this, but I wasn't ready to give up so I called Customer Support.  Now, I'm not a fan of CS, and I try to use them as my very last resort, and while I understand it's their job to ask the same canned questions at the beginning of each call (full name, phone number, address, email, etc. etc.) all I want is an answer to my problem.  The CS Rep had absolutely NO CLUE what was going on and basically had me redo everything I already said I did and ask me repeatedly if I actually did them.  What I thought would be a 10 minute call lasted for just over an hour.  At the end of the call, his only solution was for me to box it up and exchange it because it was defected.  I knew this wasn't the case because I could get the camera to work; I just couldn't link it to my account.  So we hung up and I fiddled around with it myself.  I was eventually able to get it to work, and I honestly cannot tell you what I did.  I do know that I found a software update online and downloaded it.  Maybe that's what did it, who knows?  Anyway, after a few hours of very stressful trying-every-single-thing-in-the-book, I had it up and running.  I was even able to eventually link to my existing account.The camera is a little bigger and heavier than I thought, but it feels very well constructed and looks very nice set up on my shelf.  The included AC adapter is long, which is perfect for me since the shelf it sits on is high up.  The video quality is what you'd expect from D-Link.  Not HD movie quality, but pretty clear.  The IR sensor is much more sensitive than the one on my first camera (the DCS-932L).  It switches from day to night vision more often than my previous camera and the day vision quality shows pretty vibrant colors.  Even in almost total darkness, video quality is clear.  Sound quality is great; very clear and very loud.  Pan/tilt is a little jerky, but still my favorite feature and biggest reason for purchasing this.  I didn't realize it can record video, but it can, although you have to supply the micro SD as none comes with it.  It does come with a remote that you can use to move the camera around, although I'm not sure how useful this would be for me since the only time I really need to view my camera or pan/tilt it is when I'm not home.  I toyed around with the remote anyway, and while using it while viewing myself via the web portal on my laptop, there was some very audible, very ear grating feedback whenever the camera panned/tilted.  The only cool thing about the remote is the privacy button, that when pressed, immediately points the lens downward so that no one can watch you.  Might be good for people who let voyeurs watch them, but pretty useless for me since I'm the only one who looks at my camera, and again, only when I'm not home.Using it through the MyDLink website is very easy.  If you've used this site before and already have other cameras, it just gets added to the top of the list and switching between cameras is quick and fast.  It did take me more time than I thought necessary to change its settings.  The advance settings page is not user friendly at all and you'll have to dig around some to find the options to change video quality/SD card enabling/video recording/etc.  There were several times when I made changes that I had to go back and redo them because my changes wouldn't save.  I'm not sure why they don't give their website the same attention to detail that they do their hardware.  What good is \"very user friendly\" hardware when the software is frustratingly difficult?I have Android products, so this portion doesn't apply to those of you who use iOS.  As far as downloading the Android mobile app, I strongly suggest you stick with the Lite version versus the paid.  This is one of the few (if not only) instances where the free version is actually better than the paid.  The only feature difference between the two is that you get \"multiple camera viewing\" if you pay.  That's not entirely true; the active screen is the livefeed and the others are just still shots.  And for some reason, the paid version drops connections much more frequently than the free version.  It took me a minute to figure out how to pan/tilt in the mobile app, as there were no directions written anywhere.  They don't have a tablet version mobile app, so the app just looks stretched out when viewing from anything 7\" and up.  Kind of a waste of screen real estate in my opinion, and going to the web portal via your tablet will not work as well.The included directions are lacking, to say the least.  It doesn't tell you what to do during set up or how to use or change the features.  Everything I learned about the camera I learned by clicking random options and trial and error.  D-Link seriously needs to do a better job of teaching their consumer on how to operate their product.I was torn between whether to give this 3 or 4 stars.  4 stars because this brand of camera has proven to be pretty reliable and the quality is worth the money.  3 stars because set up was such a headache for me I literally almost smashed it.  I ended up going with 4 because once you get through that heartburn, the DCS-5222L is a solid product.  I'm actually considering purchasing another one for another room in the house, if I can get past the set up fear.", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unfinished product", "Author": "Suomipoika", "ReviewID": "R2VRQ4Z49CGPT7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have experience with many security cameras like Mobotix, Ailocom, Logitech, etc. I bought D-Link DCS-5222L to test it and finally I compare it to Logitech Alert 750i. I have used MacBook Pro to test both cameras. The software version of the camera is 1.Physical characteristicsCamera looks and external feel is ok and it is heavier than I thought. You must buy MicroSD card separately.InstallationInstallation process was easy and fast. D-Link supports Mac, too, even if there is no installation manual or even any Mac hint available.Picture qualityThe first picture was disappointment as the picture was not sharp. You can, however, make it sharper by rotating the lens (this was not mentioned in the installation manuals). Still the picture quality is not very good. The camera has infrared LEDs and this way you can see the night pictures, too. The night quality is naturally not as good as daytime but it is usable. The camera switches from color to B/W automatically for the night time recording.You can select between 1280x720, 640x320, 320x176 or 160x80 resolution. 1280x720  seems to be unstable and freezes easily. When you watch this highest resolution, don't touch your browser window!Voice qualityThe recorded voice quality is pretty good and clear.MydlinkThe only recommended way to access the camera is through mydlink.com web pages and you have to create an account to do this. Even if the manual denies it, you can access the camera directly with its ip address but this way you can not see recorded videos.SecurityThe intimacy protection and security is a question mark as D-Link people can access freely your camera stream and its recorded video clips. Don' install it to your bedroom :-)Snapshot featureYou should be able to take snapshots pictures and videos and with the original setup it was able to store them to MicroSD card. I could see the filenames but I couldn't access them. Next I changed this recording to my MAC disk. This caused that Firefox to crash and Safari didn't do anything when pushing snapshot buttons. I couldn't get recording back to MicroSD anymore - resetting would do it for sure. Well, I don't really need this feature but it is not functional in MAC; I didn't test it with Windows.Motion detection and recorded videosThe motion detection is still a big question mark. You are not able to fine tune it properly for the day and night operation. If the sensitivity is high, the recording is triggered during the night time constantly without any movement. My guess is that the blinking infrared LEDs create a reflection from the furniture and this is interpreted as a movement.When you want to see your recorded videos, there are small thumbnails and clicking them you can see the video itself. There are some problems with this, too. The thumbnail shows the first picture of the recording, which you normally define to be 5 seconds before the event; this way you always see same empty thumbnails. If you don't record anything before the event, then you get useful thumbnails. This is clear programming bug. Thumbnails or the first level video screen do not show event time; when you click the first level video and get the full scree, then you can see the date and the time.My conclusion is that there is some potential with this product to be a proper security camera one day but currently the software is far from being ready. I hope the next version brings better results. Now I can recommend this only with high reservations.Comparison to Logitech Alert 750iPicture quality daytime:  Logitech is the winner.Picture quality during the nighttime: D-Link is the winner as Logitech has no infrared LEDs.Voice quality: D-Link is clear winner.Software: Logitech is Windows only and you can use it with Mac but for software updates you need Windows. D-Link supports both.Software quality: D-Link has far too many bugs; Logitech software seems to be stable.Remote use: D-Link free, Logitech has annual fee ($80)Security and intimacy protection: both are unsafe and the vendors have free access to your cameras.Connection: D-Link has wired and wi-fi connection. Logitech has only wired using powerline.Motion detection: Logitech is the clear winner.Recorded event search: draw.", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cool but software needs work.

This is my biggest complaintCan not adjust how far the cam moves at a time even though they have setting for it they dont save.The digital zoom is crap.Pic quality is not good unless you are on the same network the device is connected to. When viewing it across the internet the cam gives you a horrible small pic and even if you tell it to take a snap shot it gives you the crappy resolution instead of what you have the cam set to.Constant connection failures even on a hardline. I do not understand that. Tested on multiple networks and I am a tech for a living so it is not like I dont know what I am doing.To expensive for the quality it provides.(If they add anti flicker and fix the interface to have save points on every page of the interface it would be much better.It is supposed to be a hd cam but when viewing over the internet it is not hd and you have to use the zoom on your browser then it cuts of the control button on the webpage. very dissapointing!I have a logitech confrence cam that has much better quality and costs the same but the logitech does not have a web based connection for remote control as far as I know.", "Date": "August 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Couldn't ask for a better camera.", "Author": "Gift Card Customer \"Yeahhhh boyeee\"", "ReviewID": "RBIZ54LO50PI7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We had a rash of break-ins in our neighborhood during work hours. Having spent a small fortune on \"professional\" surveillance systems for my business, I wanted something a little less expensive, and I definitely didn't want a monthly fee attached to it. So I picked up one of these cameras to give it a whirl. I've got a little more experience than the average Joe, but the setup seemed easy enough. I was up in under five minutes. The toughest part was synchronizing it to my wireless router, but WPS makes that fairly painless. The quick-start instructions were pretty clear. Our remote access has been flawless. Both my wife and I have been able to watch (and HEAR) these cameras on our Android smartphones for several months without fail. The picture isn't as HD as I'd like it to be, but it's still not too shabby. It's clear enough to make out faces and details. The low light via infrared isn't too bad either. I did have one issue with the internal add-on SD card. I had to try two different ones before I found one that worked. It seems to hate the newer SD cards, but I believe a firmware update may have resolved that issue. I haven't done it yet, but the 8 GB SD card I have installed works fine. The e-mail notifications are awesome. I've got mine set up to send me five e-mail attachments with each motion detection. My favorite part is that I can move the camera nearly 360 degrees with my phone. My teenage kids think it's spooky that I can watch them from work and hear their arguments all over the house verbatim. No more he-said she-said -- I've got the truth now :) Overall, recommend highly.

Also the capability of viewing your camera from your smartphone or through mydlink.com is very good addition to you IP camera.The internal recording, through the additional SD card, makes it unnecessary to have your PC turned on while monitoring and recording, which is a big plus.I bought this one to test and see if I liked it and guess what, more D-link cameras are on their way.I would recommend this one anyone who wants to buy a easy installation security cameras for their home or business.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Needs work", "Author": "Ricky H.", "ReviewID": "R1FWQBOVCVXA9R", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am writing this mainly to warn potential buyers of the issues that I have encountered after several weeks of use.Here are some details about my setup. I am running a Netgear 6300 wireless router and minus the update I needed for the camera, setup was a matter of linking the two wirelessly.  Once you register directly on Dlink's website, you were able to access the camera via online. I later downloaded the app on my iphone 5 and found several issues.The app does not allow the transmission of voice and sound simultaneously. I need to press the mic on to speak and then press the mic off to hear. By the time the mic was off, the person on the other end was already halfway through their sentence.  The mic works better than average and is built into the camera base.  There are no built in speakers, so keep that in mind. The auto day and night vision works as advertised.Another issue I found was the inability to pan and tilt with one continuous motion. Can you imagine trying to view a burglar on your property? By the time you get from one end of the house to the other, he or she would be gone.The sound begins to skip/pause after an average of a minute so the need to press the sound button to refresh is required.Once you setup the different viewing qualities, you are given the ability to change between them on the app. This feature would be great if the higher quality settings didn't lag as bad as it does, which really renders it useless.Accessing the camera via online allows the user to patrol and store key positions for quick viewing but these features are unavailable on the app.Like the other reviewers have stated, this is still in beta and requires more attention.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "The Linux Colonel", "ReviewID": "RIZKKVB4J2RU9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera works great locally or remotely via android tablet and phone.

You can't create an account on mydlink unless their PC application can locate the camera. If it can't locate the camera, you can't get any help  because DLink doesn't respond (other than sending a confirmation email) to customer support tickets from mydlink. You can't view any customer support ticket that you do create because you need an account on mydlink to view them!So unless their idioticPC application works (and it's not just specific to the version of operating system you're using, and not just specific to the exact camera model you've got, it's also specific to the hardware revision of that model of camera!) then you're screwed if you want to use anything other than the web interface built-in to the camera.DLink makes a public show of responding to bad reviews, but flat out doesn't respond at all to customer support tickets they acknowledge were created. I have received no communications at all on either support ticket I created, and the first was created on Feb 19th.The long version: (this is so far beyond ridiculous that it has to be documented to be believed)DLink makes good hardware. I've got several DLink network cards, I've got an wifi AP and a few other pieces of hardware from them, all solid.What DLink doesn't make is functional software. I work with CRM systems for a living, and I've never seen such an incompetent job at customer support/relations as DLIink has cobbled together.The first thing to be aware of is that you cannot use any of their apps unless you register the camera with mydlink.com. That seems only slightly annoying but that's because you imagine you just go to their website and create an account and you're done with it. Not so. What you have to do is run an application on your PC (an .exe file) that identifies the camera and that is the *only* way you can create a mydlink account.Still doesn't sound so bad, does it? Well, the PC application doesn't work. I'm able to connect to the camera via its web interface, I can view the video, I'm able to upgrade firmware etc., but their PC application program cannot locate the camera!No biggie, just open a customer support ticket, right? Yeah, well, I got a confirmation email saying that CSP14024012 had been created. Then nothing. No further communications from DLink.After a couple of business days I went back to check the status of  CSP14024012. Guess what? Without an account on mydlink.com, you cannot check the status of the customer support ticket that was created!I went to newegg and posted a bad review based on my dismal experience.DLink almost immediately responded to my review saying \" Based on the problem described within your review, it would appear that perhaps D-Link technical support could assist you with your issues Please click on the following link listed below, ...\"Clicking on the link gets this:\"Sorry but we are unable to process your request.The link that you are using is no longer valid.If you need to find FAQs, firmwares, and other support information for one of your D-Link products, please visit D-Link Support.\"I open up a second customer support ticket (CSP14024579) and tell them to quit responding to the bad reviews and start responding to CSP14024012.I get a confirmation email saying that another support ticket has been created and then NOTHING. Not so much as a peep out of DLink. I triple checked my junk mail folder to make sure gmail isn't filtering it, there's nothing in there or in my inbox. I got the two confirmation emails from when I created the CS tickets, and those confirmation emails went to my inbox, not to junk mail, so the channel is clearly working. DLink is simply not responding.A couple of days later when I was in the mood for more punishment, I go rooting around on their website and I discover something insanely stupid about their applications. Apparently they aren't just specific to the model of the camera you purchase, they are specific to the freaking hardware version of the model that you buy! So you don't have to just differentiate between a DCS-5222L and a DCS-5222LB, you have to be sure to download the appropriate application for a DCS-5222L with hardware version 1.x verus a DCS-5222L with hardware version 2.x!!!This is an *internet enabled* device! It has a completely functional web interface with every last bit of information about the unit readily available, but DLink writes some insanely stupid operating system, model and hardware revision specific application in order to circumvent that web interface and instead hard codes an extra large bucket of fail right into endless variants of this pointless application!The degree of incompetence on the part of DLink software development team is simply astounding, and even more mind boggling is that their management, marketing, sales and customer support teams all put up with it!So anyway, I download the \"correct\" application.First thing jammed into your face that screams \"utter incompetence\" every time you run any version of that application is that with a dual-monitor setup, their application starts up centered between the two displays rather than centered in the primary desktop. I've been using a dual-monitor setup for 6 years, and nearly every one of hundreds of co-workers I've got also have dual-monitor setups... but DLink either doesn't test for that common scenario or else they're too dumb to spot the problem. Either case is equally damning of their dev and QA teams.First try running it, it doesn't find the camera. On the second try it finally does locate the camera. In order to log on and create a mydlink account, you have to enter the account and password to the camera. I enter those. The software tells me a blank password isn't allowed. Fine, I use the web interface to the camera and set the password on the account and try again. The application tells me the password isn't valid.I exit the application and start it again, to be sure it has refreshed its data from the camera. It tells me the password isn't valid. Positive that I'm using the correct account and password, I try it several more times. It rejects it. I go to the web interface and confirm that the account and password are valid by logging out and logging back in. Try the PC application again. Nope.So I terminate the app and I try to hit the cameras web interface in order to change the account and password and reboot the device to be absolutely certain the password is set. No go. Using the DLink application has somehow knocked the camera offline!The next day I try again. The HTTP interface is working again, but no combination of account and password is accepted. So I still can't create a mydlink account.I was a little annoyed thinking that it was the fact that the .exe file I needed to run was hardware version specific. Then I sat down today to try again to get the thing working. Guess what? Web interface works fine on the camera, and now the hardware version specific .exe file that was working) can no longer locate the camera!So, any insanely crazy ideas about using the Android app to monitor what's going on in the basement are out the window. I'm done wasting time on it, I've probably spent 3 or 4 hours fiddling with it now.Unfortunately when I went to package the thing back up to return it, I discovered to my great dismay that we had accidentally discarded the original box and packaging :\\ So now I've got one of those pieces of expensive shelfware sitting around that remind me not to buy DLink in the future.I should point out that I work with the engineering/development side of CRM systems. I design, write and support server side processes that deal with both IPv6 and IPv4 networks, so it's not like I ordinarily struggle with something as simple as my home network. That said, I am sometimes guilty of rushing through without reading the instructions, and I initially was guilty of that in the case of this camera. Given that it's an internet enabled device with a fully functional interface, and that it took me only a matter of seconds to power on the device, locate it on my network and begin using the web interface to upgrade the firmware on the unit, I don't think that any specific instructions or clarifications should really be required beyond that point. Create a freaking account. How hard can it be? Well, DLink seems to specialize in inventing ways of making a trivial process like that impossible regardless of whether you rush through the process or read everything line-by-line :\\None of that excuses DLink's complete lack of response to customer support tickets.Needless to say I've got no plans to buy anything from DLink in the future. I really like their hardware, none of it has ever failed on me but if this is their idea of \"customer support\" then I simply got very, very lucky when I purchased those other products of theirs and never needed their software or their customer support to get them working.", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "This camera is full of unpredictable problems :(", "Author": "Konstantin Gredeskoul", "ReviewID": "R3ICU1OYRB73X0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is my 3rd dLink camera I bought, and the first two worked flawlessly, I can connect to them quickly, and they were very easy to configure.I wasted 2-3 hours on this model, trying to set it up, and eventually gave up.

I wanted at least 720p so after my research, I ended up picking up a pair of these over Black Friday.The initial setup is very easy.  I used the WPS option and never plugged the camera into my router or switch.  Trying to avoid using their setup software as long as possible, I found the new IP in my router's settings and then browsed into it using Chrome.  The initial username/password is admin/<blank>.  The first thing I did was look around the live view tab and other settings.  I was disappointed to see that the live view and settings required Java and a plug-in (just for the live view).  I have a spare PC for installing \"crap\" and installed the required components and immediately pulled up a nice 720p feed that looked well lit even in the dark!  There were plenty of settings here to configure the microSD capture, video/audio quality, motion detection, and presets (focal points so you can have the camera jump to different views).From here, there was nothing indicative of setting up the \"cloud\" offering so after some Googling, it required either the software setup CD or a utility from the web.  I pulled the utility from the Dlink website and ran it.  Using it, I could setup a Dlink Cloud account and link the camera to it.  PTZ works fine, though the motor is a bit noisy.After that was complete I was able to login to Dlink's cloud cam website and view the camera (though there was little else to do) and control the pan/tilt/night vision.  There were no detailed settings here compared to the ones that were available while directly browsing the camera.  I was quite disappointed that there were no options like scheduling recordings/uploads, etc.To test the mobile capabilities I installed the \"myDlink lite\" app on my Android phone and tablet.  After logging in, I could see the feed and again, that was about it.  I could do simple camera control, but there were no other settings to be tweaked.I had two of these cameras and since I didn't want them to be uploading to the web constantly (I'm on Uverse/DSL) nor accessible if Dlink is hacked, I wanted to remove them from Dlink's cloud.  You can do this easily from the web interface, however it resets your camera to factory defaults.Not a huge deal, but I had to go through the WPS and then the setup again.Now, I'm just using the direct web interface to view the cameras (works fine on PC, though I'd wish they would do this natively in HTML5 since it supports WebRTC for video/audio).  To view this on mobile, you can browse to them using a mobile browser and it puts you into a simple (and confusing, unlabeled page) page that shows a camera icon (for snapshot) and a 1, 2, 3, or 4.  Those are the different streams based on the advanced configuration (via the direct web interface).  For example, 1 is the high-def (720p) feed that's used while using a PC to browse to the camera directly.  Feed 4 is a very low-res, low-framerate feed for mobile devices.  You can tweak the other feeds as well including codec, bitrate, etc.  I've changed feed 2 to be a higher-res, 15 fps feed that works fine on an iPad's Safari browser.Overall the camera is great and the direct view/settings are great (if you don't mind installing Java and a plugin), but I wish they could do this in HTML5 for plugin-less access on more devices and I wish the Cloud option had more controls including scheduling, bitrates, and presets for PTZ locations.I've only had them for 3 days and so far they've been solid.  I'll update if anything changes drastically either way.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "You don't have to use the software!", "Author": "Erik G", "ReviewID": "R2GBJGONPK5ZEZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this as a baby monitor.We have a (similar price range) baby monitor that outputs low resolution video to a handheld wireless display.

I used the Windows explorer network GUI to locate the camera, right-clicked the icon, and selected 'view device webpage'. logged in with default credentials.
