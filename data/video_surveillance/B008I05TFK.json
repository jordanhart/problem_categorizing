{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Don't be fooled by low price, better options out there", "Author": "K. Machuga \"KJM\"", "ReviewID": "R2AJCEF5HN8BB1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I previously purchased a system from a local store that was OK, but it was impossible to get it work with a smart phone, so I decided to give this system a try. One of the reasons I selected it is because it uses 3.6mm lenses instead of 4mm like most other systems. In short, the higher the number, the better you can see far away- but it's at the expense of the viewing angle, it will be narrower. If you put a 4mm camera on your door or garage, for example, a person will be out of your view about 10 feet before they get there (if someone was knocking at your door, you would not be able to see them). Since I am trying to secure my house and garage, I am not interested in seeing things very far away (like on the street) as much as I am seeing someone who is close to my house and the 3.6mm cameras handle that nicely.Pros:-Definitely a good price if you're on a budget (but it's deceptive, keep reading)-Setup was pretty easy, even through the your smart phone app (I have an iPhone). You won't have issues there.-Works with adequate video quality, though not great. (read the end of my review for an explanation of this, it's important for this product)-Personally, I like the 3.6mm lenses, but that will depend on what it is your are trying to see.Cons:-Like the other reviewer said, the cameras appear cheap and flimsy compared to the unit I returned that was only a little more money. So far they've been in operation for about 4 months, but Winter is coming so we'll see.-Videos cables are of poor quality (more on that in a minute).-Searching video is terrible, so bad I rarely even want to do it.-Software interface for DVR has annoying inconsistencies (too hard to explain it all, but it's just clumsy)-Time keeps going way off, which is a big issue if you want to search for stuff.I'll get to the biggest reason why this system made me unhappy overall. When I had my previous system that I returned, I had already run some of the video cables through my attic and did not return them with the system. When I initially hooked up my first few Zmodo cameras to the PREVIOUS systems video cables that I had already run, the picture was adequate. Most cameras in this price range or even a little higher don't have super sharp pictures during the day and don't see very well at night when they are outside (the infrared light just scatters, but this can be solved with some motion sensor lighting). I was not expecting a miracle there. But when I started to install the other Zmodo cameras using the cables that came with THEIR system, the picture was not good at all. Turns out it was extremely poor signal quality of the cable that came with this unit. Because I had most of the Zmodo cameras installed outside my house, I just purchased better cables locally, but they were about 16 bucks each. So now your great price on this 200 system just went up 8 x 16 = $128.I knew this camera didn't come with a hard drive, no big deal. But if you figure that is gonna cost $60, now you up to $400 for your camera system. Believe me, I think there are much better options out there for that price. Q-See is brand that I think you could get an 8 camera system for 450 and it would likely be way better than this.If you are gonna through the hassle of installing cameras outdoors- which is a huge headache, btw, it took me many hours- you do NOT want to do it with their cheap quality cables. At least if you use good cables and these cameras die in year, you can purchase a new camera and not have to worry about a crappy picture.My last tip- most of us won't be searching much on these cameras to catch criminals or even watching them on your smart phone after a few weeks. When you do search, you'll find yourself using it for goofy stuff- to see what animal got in your trash, to see who left something on your porch, etc- but unfortunately, the search function on this thing is so god awful, I don't ever really want to mess around on it. It will be there if you really need it, like a break in, but you probably wont want to go through the headache for looking at little stuff (the time going off is an issue, because then you have to do the math in your head to figure out when to search). Which is a shame since you have a camera system that should be able to do it!SUMMARY: Now that the I have the cameras running on decent cables, it gets the job done. With the exception of the searching function, I don't hate the system, but the money I had to put into it to get it just to an acceptable level makes it an easy PASS when it comes to selecting a security system. Maybe if you already have video cables or you don't care about a grainy picture with the ones they ship with (you can see what is going on, it's just not very clear), it might be worth it. But the way this system came out of the box, I found it pretty unacceptable even for 200 bucks.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ok for the average user", "Author": "What a disappointment!!!", "ReviewID": "R1EQ0UMINIQYGW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The equipment comes in with perfect condition.  Great for the price.  This can be used for short distance monitoring as the graphic are grainy and night vision is not that great.  The leg stand and screws are flimsy (bad design and bad material).  The screw can strip the metal stand thread easily, just need to be careful.  Had to return it and bought a higher resolution camera from Q-See.
