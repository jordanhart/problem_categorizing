However, the remote monitoring set up is near impossible without using customer support's help.The biggest problem is it takes forever to reach a rep (alright 20-30 minutes of hold time).  But then the reps never seem to have the full answer.  They seem to want to get to the next call.  I had to call about 6 times over two weeks to get ALL of the set up info.  And even then, when I went on vacation, the playback feature wouldn't work.  Now I'll call them to get that piece of info.Also, I had one really rude rep who I'm guessing has since been fired.They need to train the reps better and to have the reps fully test the remote access setups before they end the phone call with you.The picture quality is ok.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$399.99", "Features": "Viewable anywhere in the world via Safari 5.0 and Internet Explorer, tablet PCs & on your 3G/4G Smartphone\nMotion activated recording with real time email alerts\nD1 Recording\n420 TV line of resolution and 11 LEDs for night vision up to 30 feet\nLifetime Customer SupportAll Night Owl security products come with lifetime customer support via or website www.NightOwlSP(dot)com or by phone 1-866-390-1303", "Name": "Night Owl Security LB-4DVR5-4CM 4 Channel H.264 D1 DVR with 4 pack CMOS Cameras 400+ TVL", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4100yTUtHUL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007MLV5D6"}}
