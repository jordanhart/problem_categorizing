{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The best affordable camera for the average consumer.", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R122PPCY295P5R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: 1. The picture is very clear at 700 TVL. 2. Variable wide angle lens; LOVE IT!Con:  Should be able to set the lens angle by WIRELESS remote.  My reason for only a 4 star rating.  The camera need a specal 3 in 1 BNC cable to use the wired OSD remote not the standard BNC cables like most others.  It is included in the camera bundle as well as the OSD wired remote.  (I don't belive the OSD will adjust the wide angle feature to varies degrees.)I used a variety of cameras for my home from the major industry competitors to achieve my variety of viewing objectives.  Some cameras were so bad even thou the package listed 600 TVL I returned them to the store.  Others were Ok.  The best of the bunch were Swann.  I rate them number one.  Once I got hold of one of Sawnn dome cameras.  I projects no infer red LED lights.  I quickly ordered more of Sawnn cameras.  This time I purchased their bullet cameras at 700 TVL.  I brought the bullets because of my viewing objectives.  Hands down Swann seems to be the best cameras.  My installer was so impressed he ordered 2 Swann cameras and is on the lookout to upgrade his current setup with 2 more.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent product", "Author": "Norma S.", "ReviewID": "R3V1O0GMXFY2N7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a professional install my first four cameras at home for the tune of over $2,500.  I wanted more coverage and was told it would be over $1,500.  I took my chance on these and I, as a home owner can say, that they are as good or better than the ones I paid to have installed.  Very easy instructions, clear picture both during the day and night.  My husband was able to install these by himself and they look great! Excellent quality and you can't beat the price.", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product", "Author": "trawinx \"trawinx\"", "ReviewID": "R1UAOLXPQKQW4F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have not had a chance to hook this one up yet but because of the last 2 I purchased I'm confident it will be fine.  Was received on time and was new, good price and with the first one I bought had to call Swann and they were very helpful.  Happy I checked online because I was able to save some money and free shipping, can't beat that!", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Good Camera With Limited Mounting Options", "Author": "Jack Dallas", "ReviewID": "RC9N6CG0VVN3M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Camera performance is very good.  I needed the wide angle coverage and the stock cameras were limited.  I used this camera to replace one of the kit cameras that fogged up.  That camera couldn't be cleaned or easily fixed so the wide angle replacement was needed.  This camera has noticeably better resolution and often provides a color picture at night when ambient lighting from my flood lights is adequate.  Mounting options and aiming are limited as this device is designed to be mounted on a wall or roof.  All but one of my cameras are mounted under the roof overhang.  This camera required that I build a wooden shelf simulating a roof mounting.  My walls are concrete and all my wiring is done through an attic crawl space into the roof overhang.  This camera is mounted high and the shelf had to be built with a slight downward angle in order to adjust it for coverage.  My wall here is at a 45 degree angle to the aiming point so both turning the 45 degrees and tilting down were very difficult.  I didn't connect the zoom/focus wire and left the adjustment as it came from the factory which was wide and focused at a distance.  The manual adjustment screws must be buried deep within the camera as the outside nuts seemed to be merely covers.  Manual adjustment when mounted would be difficult.  Overall, after my mounting problems were solved, the camera works very well as a high resolution wide angle device.", "Date": "October 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's ok", "Author": "Hanson Clarke", "ReviewID": "R3SV2NVHTX7ELS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Camera is ok not da best night vision but ok by far da best camera out for the price. :-)", "Date": "September 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$179.00", "Features": "See more with high resolution 700 TV lines Color 1/3\" Sony 'Effio' CCD video, powerful infrared night vision & vari-focal controls for high quality video in any light, near or far\nUse the On-Screen Display (OSD) controller & built-in software to customize the camera settings for professional video surveillance\nEasily mount to walls with cable threaded through the bracket for added protection\nFight back against crime by deterring intruders & protecting your property\nPlug into your DVR for recording or TV's yellow video-in socket for immediate surveillance", "Name": "Swann SWPRO-780CAM-US Pro-780 Ultimate Optical Zoom Camera (White)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FpXLbBYwL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008B4KMSC"}}
