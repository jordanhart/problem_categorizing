Unfortunately, that's not the case.  After the security cameras were hooked up and running I noticed at night that I had scrolling horizontal lines.  it seemed really odd and I thought I had a bad camera until I noticed a second camera doing it.  Two of eight cameras, and they were both from different manufacturers, is not a bad camera issue.  I looked at the video camera cables and unplugged the first white cable.  Sure enough it turned off the backyard camera, which was scrolling.  I tried the other white cable and sure enough, it turned off the hallway camera which was also flickering.  Instantly I knew what the issue was.  These cables are not shielded at all and the noise is causing the scrolling.Amazon was great.  The refunded all six that I had ordered and I put in an order for some Q-see shielded cables instead of this third party type.  The moment I hooked them up, they worked perfectly and the scrolling horizontal lines are gone.  That's the way a company should respond and that's the quality of the Q-see product compared to VideoSecu.  So stick with the name brand and be sure they are shielded.", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cable Works", "Author": "Sean R.
