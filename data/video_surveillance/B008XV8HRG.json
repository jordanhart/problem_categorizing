At first I had a camera that the power cable would not fit with this cable.  So I was very disappointed. I was ready to send back to Amazon for a refund. Solution was solved by buying a $2.00 adapter. So I decided to go ahead and keep it. Glad I did, but later found that the problem was not this cable, the problem was the PTZ camera I had purchased. Which eventually returned back to the seller (on Ebay). Bought another PTZ camera and works great with this set of cables. I later bought another cable kit (100 ft.) for another PTZ camera.To sum it up, these cables are very well made, adapts to all weather, great quality at a great price. I would highly recommend these cables to any and everyone.", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Cable but marked wrong", "Author": "Paul Stevenson", "ReviewID": "R1UQ7SBDW1QZV5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well made cable.
