{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Zmodo 8ch DVR system", "Author": "I. Kosvin \"IL.K.\"", "ReviewID": "REHHYO751GPGB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This system is pretty slick. If you know your way around networks, DDNS, IP forwarding, IP ports etc., you will not have a problem to set it up. The instructions that come with the system probably assumes that it will  be setup by professional. I had to fiddle couple evenings with it until I was able to set it to work with LAN and stream remotely to my Samsung Galaxy S2. I liked that all the software comes on the included CD, even the apps to all kinds of smartphones. The 4 cameras included with the system are beginner class and have very limited range at night. For the price they are fine, but if you want to have good quality video, consider spending some $$ and add good cameras. If you consider to buy this system, don't forget the hard drive. I bought Seagate Barracuda 1TB (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005T3GRNW/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00), works great with the DVR.", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Product, Great Value. Not a no name Chinese model.", "Author": "Windoe's C.", "ReviewID": "R1Z52XOTL2IS4Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought a different brand unit at popular auction site, DVR and cameras were no name brand from China. Horrible product, no support whatsoever. I finally got a refund and purchased this one. WOW Big difference a brand name makes. Cameras are superior to other unit I had. Although they are not HD quality, what do you expect for under $130.00. If you want perfect quality spend more money. For what I paid, I think this is a great buy. IR works well at night within about 20-30ft. Anything over that not so much. Set up isn't for the laymen, if you have PC and network knowledge you will do fine. I tried to get the mobile app working for about a week. I finally broke down and called Tech support for Zmodo. They are based in Illinois, and they speak English. They immediately identified my issue, emailed a link to a firmware update, and had me up and running in no time. Just the American based Tech Support is enough to keep me as a customer for a long time. American based tech support is a gem to find. For the money I spent, I think that this was a great buy. It serves my needs well for a home security system to keep the neighbors and my teenage step daughter at bay. I can now access it from work, my laptop, and my phone. Sign up for a dyndns account and you will never lose access due to IP changes. Also make sure you have port forwarding configured correctly within your router. The 4 60ft cables may not be enough to reach around your house. Luckily I had 2 50ft cables laying around, that I used to extend the two out to the opposite side of my house.Pros:AMERICAN Tech support (M-F).Wide Angle Cameras for larger viewing area.24 IR LEDs, Decent night vision.White cameras blend well with exterior of home.Software included with DVR.Instructions are decent.Extensive Zmodo Knowledge base online.Cons:60ft cables may not completely reach farthest ends of home. Maybe include 2 50' and 2 100' cables or buy a couple extra.Support live chat is based overseas ( Call the 800 number M-F to reach US).Color is off during day (I know my grass is green not blue-brown) not a deal breaker for me. I uploaded a couple pictures to show.IR is not 65ft, at least not in my usage. Still does the job at night.All in all, a good value for a good basic system. I would recommend to a friend.", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like it a lot.", "Author": "R.
