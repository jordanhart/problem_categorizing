{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best System for Do it yourself", "Author": "Sloan Gill", "ReviewID": "R1AGKRFPW0MZMQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this system for my mom and it is absolutely the easiest all in one system to install. It all worked right out of the box. The wireless video signal works great no matter where around the back yard and in the house she goes. The picture for day and night vision is perfect. Adding a third camera was no problem either. Press on button on the camera power wire and set the monitor in to search mode and it's done.  In fact this system is so good we bought a second system and installed it at my 93 year old grandmothers house and she loves it too. You can choose your best  camera locations and viewing angle before you permanently mount them buy carrying the wireless monitor with you and see what works best. The only thing to remember is that each camera will need a power outlet and in some cases may prove difficult for some homeowners to have the camera exactly where you want it. Other than that I think the system is perfect. It is a great independent security system for peace of mind for those who live alone. You can view any camera via the internet and check on whats happening while your are away. The cradle is not wi-fi and requires a direct line to connect to the internet so if your internet connection is not in your bedroom I would recommend buying a second AC adapter to keep the battery from going dead while you sleep Just in case you wake up and need to view the cameras for that thump in the night.  Now its time to buy one for me!", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EYPUAP2"}}
