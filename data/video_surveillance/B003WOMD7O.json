Schultz \"dalesps\"", "ReviewID": "R25WX1FWUOKYIT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted something for my entry so I didn't have to open the front door to someone I didn't know.  This system was easy to set up.  For me the remote control was easier to use than the monitor controls.  The picture is not great and the night vision range very limited, but is ok for my purpose.  The camera is about 15 feet from the front door.  The best feature of this system is the audio.  It is sensitive enough to pick up the sound of a leaf being blown by the wind.  Very good to talk to the visitor without having to open the door.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great security system", "Author": "SCC", "ReviewID": "R24AUC5Y83W5WM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I installed and started using this system since 3 days ago. It exceeded my expectations. It does everything as advertised. Just plug the camera and the monitor to 110v and paired automatically in just a couple of seconds. No bad surprises or any issue. I installed the camera to watch my home's main entrance and placed the monitor (display) in the secong floor of my house about 60 feet away from the camera, the reception is clear and strong. Please notice that display is black and white (no color image). If for any reason you turn off or unplug the camera and/or the display, it will immediately re-start with issue when you turn it on. You can set a continuous view or can be set to show image on the display only when the camera's motion sensor detects any activity (the sensitivity of the motion sensor is great), also, recording to the included SD card can be set to record continuously or only when the motion sensor detects activity, and can be set to record 5, 10 or 15 seconds everytime the motion sensor detects activity. You can also set to overwrite once the SD card is full, or can be set to stop recording when it gets full. Playing what is recorded in the SD card memory is done just by few clicks to a button. Actually, all the possible settings to the system are easily done with one or few clicks to buttons. The system is great, I fully recommend it. The intercom function works excellent. The video and voice is fully wireless between the camera and the display, and works great. Note that you will need a regular 110 volts connection where you will place the camera and the display.  The unique CONS that I perceive in this system is that btoh camera and display do NOT have the option to run based on batteries (preferably rechargeable batteries), this would be great specially to be able to move the display around different rooms in your house.  But, the system performas great as advertised, and it is a great system,  I fully recommend it!.", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Easy to install, working well", "Author": "splashy", "ReviewID": "R1FDW0X6S551CP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very happy so far with this set up. The fact that you can talk to people through the camera is a big plus, so that you don't have to open up the door if you don't want to.I like the alarm, which is loud enough to hear when turned all the way up, but not obnoxious. It's a fairly pleasant bleep, bleep sound.The camera does not turn on when there is shadow or tree limb motion, but it does when my cats go through, so that's a good thing. It seems to be able to figure out the difference somehow.Oh, and the set up was fairly painless, once I figured out to turn on the surge protector. :-D The person helping me put the camera up used the enclosed white toothpick looking thing to push in the pairing hole, and it connected right up.The video color is fairly good during the day, there are some adjustments you can make as to how bright you want the picture to be, and the resolution is good enough that you can recognize people. The audio is good enough, so all in all I'm very happy with this set up, for the price. The night vision is just about as good as the day vision, but in black and white which is to be expected with night vision.You have to manually point it where you want it, but if you just want to monitor a certain area that's fine. If you want a camera that you can point in different directions while being inside, this is not the one for you.Note added later: I got more cameras, and discovered that if you have them too close together their signals seem to interfere with each other, leading to the display not working right. I moved the second one further away, and now it's working perfectly. They were right next to each other, pointed in different directions, so I don't know how far you would have to go to not have that problem.", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "SVAT GX301-010 digital wireless security system", "Author": "LHutchinson", "ReviewID": "R3QMZYAXJMPXC2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my first SVAT GX301-010 digital wireless security system for my home in December 2012.  Absolutely love it.  Very easy installation.  Easy to operate.  I have 2 cameras connected to a 19 inch televion for easy viewing.  I have since purchased 2 additional cameras to expand coverage of my property.  My most recent purchase was for my mother (age 82 and lives alone) which included a 2 camera system with 7 inch monitor.  She has a 7 inch monitor by her bed for nighttime viewing and a 19 inch tv to view during the day so she can see who is at the door prior to opening the door. I do plan to expand her system also.

It is rainy and cold here in the Northwest winter so I did a quick temporary installation. The camera linked up with the monitor quickly.  It has a nice clear picture and sensitive audio pickup.  I have a large street light mounted on the garage so I can't say how well it does in total darkness but the picture is quite clear at night.  One drawback to this set is the range.  During the day it is fine but when the sun goes down and it gets cold it stats dropping the signal. This is very annoying, but moving the monitor closer (from 50ft to 20ft) to the camera solves the problem.  This spring I will do a more permanent installation and raise the camera up from 8 to 12 ft this should help the range. Like a lot of inexpensive camera units the color washes out somewhat in bright sunlight but all in all it does a nice job and worth what I paid for it.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "good camera", "Author": "Phil", "ReviewID": "R3YHONV2KQOQQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very easy to install and set up.

The unit has a good picture in day or night. The range for the movement sensor is limited to the 40 feet so if you want to detect movement from long range this unit won't work for that.
