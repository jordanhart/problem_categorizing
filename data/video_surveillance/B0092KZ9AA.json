I already had 2 of the older 932L models and this one was easy to setup and add to the other ones in my account. This one does h264 compression so the streaming and storage of the video takes up less space than the older ones even though this one records in 720p and the older ones are 480(i think).My only complaint is that the night time recording quality is not that good, not sure what is going on but the IR is not as strong as the old ones. Considering a standalone IR to go along with this to improve the dark performance.", "Date": "June 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not worth the money. Less Features than the Non-HD version 942L", "Author": "Heather A", "ReviewID": "R32F4V7OBB8VPV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have a D-Link 942L that I've been using since last summer. I was very happy with it so when ready to add a new camera I decided to go for the HD version. Big mistake. The picture quality is not much better, the iOS app only allows me to view at 480p which is the same as my older camera and the \"advanced\" setup controls lack several of the options of my old camera. I'm very disappointed and will be returning this camera for either another 942L or perhaps a DropCam.The only positive for this camera over the 942L is the wider field of vision the lens gives. Not enough to justify the price difference.", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "much better than Dropcam", "Author": "Observe_the_cat!", "ReviewID": "R13SO8YLKQF42A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I originally purchased a Dropcam, but after many hours attempting that \"60 second setup,\" I sent the darn thing back.  I purchased this camera from a store and just ordered another one online.  I was able to set it up in about 15 minutes without much difficulty.  I've been very pleased so far - I can view the camera from my iphone and ipad as well as online (provided your computer has properly updated Java apps).  There's no lag in the video - it's all live stream, and the quality is good.  I think the night vision/black and white setting is better than the color/daytime, just for clarity (also, I am trying to track my black and white cat).  There were several firmware/Java updates necessary during the install.  Also, you can snap photos and use the microphone to scare guests :)I wish this had a pan feature, and I'm not sure if/how you can record video - the box says you can use an SD card *in* the camera, but I tried that yet.I'm excited to get the second one set up in the bedroom so I can monitor my very naughty kitty while I'm at work!", "Date": "May 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Would not recommend", "Author": "bman", "ReviewID": "RBNKAB8LZWG83", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had many dlink products in the past.

They were fairly easy to set up - I use a D-Link cloud router so they are very compatible with it.  I also downloaded both the MyDlink app for the iPhone and iPad and those apps work well with the camera - though some features can only be reached when you are connected to it by  computer.  I recommend using the LAN/cat 5 cable to set the camera up - I tried setting up by following the wireless set-up and couldn't make it happen. But the wired set-up works well for the initial set and then you can unplug the camera from the wire and use it in the wireless mode.  There's a slot for a micro SD card and you can save recorded clips on the camera and view them later.  This camera has good HD quality color video and has an auto night mode which gives you pretty good quality back and white video illuminated by a small infrared light on the camera. I have 3 cats and a dog and was able to set the camera so they aren't constantly triggering the camera by their movements. You also have the ability to take still images through your computer or the phone/tablet apps.  Overall, a great little security camera for the price -  I marked it down one-star because I think they could still do better improving the set-up and some of the interfaces and features of the apps.", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "No Two Way Audio for DCS-2132LB1", "Author": "Le Hoang Anh", "ReviewID": "R80G62IY4KRJF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought two DCS-2132LB1 but mydlink Lite Mobile App (both Android and iOS) no display two Way Audio for this modem.[...]", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Difficult to install and hard to set up!!!!", "Author": "B.
