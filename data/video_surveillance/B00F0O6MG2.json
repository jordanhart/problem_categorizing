{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice product BUT", "Author": "Niles \"NDH\"", "ReviewID": "R2UJOMXVDOULN3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It would be much nicer if the manual was for the generation of the unit.  Some problems can be better solved other than trial & error.  It can be controlled by the front panel, the mouse or the remote.  I haven't tried to use it remote or on the LAN.  Without a good manual its slow going but it appears to have plenty of features.  Tried component video & HDMI & HMDI seems to look the best.  Installing a Hard Drive not difficult but figuring out the connectors would be easier with some pictures.  If your not going to add a Hard Drive buy a less expensive model. (won't record without Drive)  The Defeway web site is just about useless.  The included 3 & 1/8 inch CD is useless if you don't have a CD Drive that will read it.  Nice if their site had a download for the files if there are any that would help.  Im retired so I have time to play with it & learn so if your in a hurry it might not be for you.  For the motion detect areas the pale red areas are the ones being looked at.  The on off switch doesn't exist  some other features in the manual don't exist.", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$259.00", "Features": "4CH Full 960H Recording HDMI 1080P DVR/NVR/HVR Security System;720P 1080P IP Cameras(ONVIF) supported\nNo need to router mapping,just 1 step go to the Internet with eCloud technology\nThe dvr system can be connected to your USB Wireless LAN Adapter \uff08USB WIFI Adapter not included\uff09\nStable speedy eCloud;Remote Acess; Remote playback;Remote control your system\nFor iphone, instant alerts will be sent.Functioning more than email alerts, it keeps you informed instantly what's happening", "Name": "D5110WH4 4CH Full D1 960H Recording HDMI 1080P DVR/NVR/HVR WIFI IP Cameras supported Security System No hdd", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xMuSQcroL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00F0O6MG2"}}
