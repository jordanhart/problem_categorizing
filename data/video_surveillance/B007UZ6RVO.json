{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works on my samsung chromebook", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R398MOTBFPG5JQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After reading other reviews for the product I had the following thoughts ahead of time: you can't snake it by itself into anything too far without another contraption to guide it, the video and lights are lower in quality, and it may or may not work without the driver cd on some people's computers.I just wanted to take a moment to share my experience with the above 3 comments and a summary of my feelings on the product.-First, the cable comes in the box twisted up tightly, so yes, the camera continually wants to curl back on itself as you are trying to push it into whatever you are trying to push it into (in my case a 2nd story air conditioning vent), so I'm definitely going to need a sturdier snake of sorts to guide the camera.-Second, after reading the reviews my expectations were set appropriately on the camera and lighting quality (think grainy, but useful and only focused within 6 inches (which is all you'd need snaking it through a tight space anyway, overall good for the money and use of the product, plus the ability to adjust brightness on the usb section is a nice feature).-Third, I have a Samsung Chromebook (the $250 one with 16gb ssd, model 303c?? not sure) and after plugging in the usb, the lights came on immediately, and after I figured out that I needed to open the \"camera\" application that came with the chromebook, it worked just fine without any need for a driver install (which is good because the chromebook can't do driver installs to my knowledge :P).-Overall summary, I am happy with my purchase. I feel that, for the money, this device does what I expected it to do and I will probably have a good number of uses for it in the future around the house (or around my friends homes as projects pop up in the future).I give it 4 stars because of the pricepoint and features.", "Date": "June 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Well worth the price", "Author": "Mark Strickland \"Techie Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R1TFXR7CE12COM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This little camera works great.It is not exactly as durable as a commercial version but it is probably only 10% of the price or less.Some reviews talked about a problem with the LED brightness but it worked fine on my MacBook Pro.  I suspect that to be a power issue with the USB connector on their computer.  There are some \"two head\" USB short extension cables that can let you plug into two USB jacks to get more power.  The camera and the LED's get all of their power from the USB socket on the computer.  I could vary the LED brightness to any level required.  The little control on the side of the plug (computer end) was a bit \"light duty\" feeling but it worked fine.The focal length of the lens is fairly close and things maybe 18 inches away or more begin to get a bit fuzzy but it will focus very close down to an inch or two.I used it to look in the wall during a remodel job of a bath where an old steel vent pipe had visible corrosion before we opened up the whole wall to look at the pipe.  As it turned out I could see more problems so we did the necessary \"drywall surgery\" to replace more of the steel vent pipe.I only used my MacBook and I recorded the inspection session with QuickTime but no drivers were required.  The CD was a small format disk (not full diameter) and probably would not work with a MacBook slot loading drive but I did not need it any way.  If you record the session you don't have to worry about pausing long enough to inspect as you go.  Just watch the screen and move around as needed then replay the video stopping where needed to inspect.  The cable is NOT stiff enough to inspect in a wall without something to guide the camera.  I used an electricians \"fish tape\" that is essentially a piece of thick spring wire rolled around a disk that allows controlled un-coiling and winding up.  I simply taped the camera to the end and pushed in to the wall.  I already had the \"fish tape\".  A dowel rod or even a straightened out coat hanger would probably work OK in most cases.  If you need more accurate control then search for \"fish tape\" on Amazon and you can find something for $10 that should work.Recommended.", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fineally, something that delivers", "Author": "J.

I also found that the device is NOT waterproof.

I had to strap another light source on to my snake to see anything behind the walls. The software should be downloadable now that many tablets and netbooks have no CD drive. The light level of the LED's needs to be addressed, and it would be great if the software could be used to adjust the brightness.Update 9/1/2013. Maybe the dim bulb is me ;-) I found the light level control finally after reading the directions. I upgraded my review to 3 stars. The reasons I do not give it a higher rating:1. The focal length is about a half inch. For my use I would have preferred 4-6 inches, or better yet autofocus from that half inch up to 6 inches. I'm looking between walls through a hole I cut in the drywall, and it is very difficult to figure out what is what when you can only see a half inch or so.2. My netbook does not have a CD drive, so I really had to jump through hoops, and create my own installation on a thumb drive on a 2nd computer (desktop). At the very least the manufacturer should provide a web link to download the software.3. This is less of an issue, but the connector wire is pretty limp, and I needed to tape the camera to a snake in order to gain some control over where the camera went.

Unfortunately, it didn't really fit my needs, and I had bought it to look into walls behind drywall for home improvement projects. Since everyone likes bulletpoints:Like!- Waterproof housing means you can use it for adventurous scoping, like for leaky pipes or drain problems.- Long cable, can let you drop and dangle this baby pretty far down the aforementioned pipe or drain.- Plug-and-play capability, didn't require any drivers with Windows 7, and should work with many webcam softwares. I used this camera with Yawcam (Google it!), and it worked fine.Dislike!- LED illumination lights are situated next to the camera, right below the protective plastic lens at the end. When turned to full brightness, the camera effectively blinds itself with the reflection of its own LEDs off of the plastic lens. Expect to have to use the onboard LED illumination at dim settings or use external illumination, which makes having onboard LEDs a bit useless.- Long cord is long and flexible, and makes it pretty difficult to orient or point the camera where you want it to. I was aware of this before purchasing it, but it ended up being a bigger issue than I had anticipated. Basically, if you need to point the camera sideways or upwards, you'll have to come up with some creative ways to do so.- Camera image quality is not very good. Again, I was expecting it at this price point, but the camera feed is quite blurry and grainy. It's workable, but expect much worse image quality than a front-facing camera on some smartphones.I ended up returning this borescope, and purchasing the much more expensive Supereyes borescope: Supereyes Waterproof Borescope Endoscope Inspection The cable isn't nearly as long, but cable will hold the position you flex it to. The camera head is smaller which lets it fit into smaller spaces, the camera image quality is better, and the camera won't blind itself with its own onboard LED illumination.

To date, I have only done some brief tests, but the lights and camera work as advertised, and this is a lot less expensive than the dedicated units used by contractors; so I believe it will work as promised.  Here are some points to consider:1. Best focus is a few inches from the lens, although a blurry image of more distant objects is usable2. Unit is > 1 cm across; so it won't fit into very small openings (conduits, water lines, electronic enclosures)3. Cord is very flexible; so it can't be used to push unit unsupported into vertical voids** I'm going to try to wrap a stiff wire around the camera head and use that to support the unit.  I think that may work.Note:  Some reviewers seem to think that you have to use the included software on Windows7, but I found that the Windows Moviemaker application's webcam option will work with it as long as you go into device manager and disable any built-in webcam (e.g. in a laptop).Suggested improvement:  A really nice improvement would be software and a cable that would allow this unit to be used with the USB port on a cell phone.  This would result in a really compact and convenient endoscopic inspection camera for the DIYer.
