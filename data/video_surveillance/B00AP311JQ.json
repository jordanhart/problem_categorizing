Let's start with the price.  This is considerably cheaper than that camera and, consequently, it has way fewer features.  Let's talk about the performance.Photos: The photos are quite good and very constrasty.  The resolution is good.  Are you ready for the bombshell?  The photos from this camera are better than those from the 8MP Browning.Range: The range is OK but I wouldn't say it's as deep as the box says it is.Sensitivity: In my estimation, this camera is way way to motion sensitive.  Sure, you won't miss an animal, but you will also have to sort through hundreds of photos of shifting shadows.  That's tedious.  The videos, by virtue of the surrounding darkness, do not trigger as easily so you'll have just the right amount.Glow:  It's about what you'd expect for a low-glow camera.  All the animals notice it, but I'd guess that most people  wouldn't notice it at night unless they were looking right at it.Video: Really good.  When you consider how little this camera costs, really really good.Only one complaint other than the sensitivity:  The strap \"hooks\" in the back are just cheap plastic and by tightening the camera down to a tree I managed to crack one of them.

The best part is that you cant see a glow at all, you can only see the red bulbs turn on, but as long as you are not looking straight at it, you wont realize. The image and video quality are not bad at all, considering the low price. The only con, it the trigger is not that fast, when the camera captures movement, it takes a few secs to take pictures or video, but is not a big issue.To round things up:What I like:*Nice size, easy to set up*Good image and video quality (as long the target stays within 10m away from the camera, especially at night)*Security integrated (you can put a chain and a padlock to secure it to a tree or pole, or buy a python lock). Also you can lock the camera, so none can access the setup buttons and take out the memory card.*No glow is seen, only the red bulbs, but you wont see them if you are not lokking staright at them. This wotn scare the animals, as a regular flash.What I dont like:*Picture and video delay can be set, but the shortest option is 1 minute. It would be great to have for 30 sec, to capture quick action*No field scan whatsoever (this is not an issue, for the low price of the camera)*A quickest trigger will be best*Im not sure that rain isolation is good to face heavy rain. (I didnt try it under the rain)I recommend this camera, but ig you need more customize options or further features, this will not be the best one (other cameras will cost more than 100 bucks, so if you are a hunter on a budget, this is the right choise).Just follow the instructions and you wont have issues.
