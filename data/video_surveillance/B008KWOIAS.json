I have it outside under the roof.It Works when it is pointed outside towards a sunny area, so I can monitor who came to my house.The night vision is just good, and gets the face clearlyThe iphone app helps a lot, which allows me to monitor from somewhere else also. Also works with the Google Nexus of my wife.It is very easy to configure.There is audio, bit noisy, since it does not filter off the background noises, but better than nothing. I can hear cars whiz by, but very little wind noise.That's all, since I have not played it much. I might be back if I find something new.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "Sunderll", "ReviewID": "R2WJ2SASR9AZKJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As usual I read the other reviews and some were disturbing. However, since this camera was precisely what I was looking for and a really good price and I was forwarded. I decided to give it a try. I't been up and running for two days now. It really was easy to set up and once I learned what command did what have had 100% satisfaction. I tried the Icloud with warning emails and text messages. It has worked flawlessly. At 3 AM, I heard my Iphone chime indicating both an email and text message. I was able to instantly view the intruder(my 6 pound cat)save the video(or still image if you prefer) of her eating food and email the video to my work email. I did the same thing at work. Mid morning the cat entered the room, I received a TM and email. I viewed the \"event\" saved the video and emailed it to my home email. All without a hitch. I live in a rural setting and leave my house empty often for business trips. Altohugh I have an alarm system and outside cameras, I always felt vulnerable. NOw, I really feel a lot better about my empty house being more secure.NOTE, so far the 3G system my Iphone has isn'tvery reliable with this system. So, for the results I mentioned, 4G or WIFI is the way to go. Don't expect too much with 3G.", "Date": "November 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "difficult keeping it connected", "Author": "Spylab", "ReviewID": "R1PCFO5WEN94L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "For the price this is OK but it was more problematic to set up and keep the connection going.  The picture was a little grainy, the camera was hard to point, and ultimately I returned the device.  I just tried another camera for the first time this week and it truly is simple and works well.  It is the dropcam and though more expensive, I think it is well worth the price difference for quality of the product and ease of use. I am referring to the regular dropcam that sells for $149 on Amazon", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Has not worked", "Author": "Katherine Price", "ReviewID": "R15R3DJ111W455", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Item has never worked.

All the parts were there. All three work.  The pnp is really simple. One of the cams is only black and white. ... no color. One flashes a light on and off when it's dark.  If I had bought these new I would have sent them back.  But for used at such a low  price they are sufficient for my needs. I don't like that the video times out after 30 minutes but these are secondary cams so for now they are Ok.  Seedonk works well but to have them record and notify they charge a fee. Loftek support is non existant.  I emailed them 5 or 6 times with questions....absolutely no response.  For this reason I will no longer buy loftek cameras. I will spend a bit more and get a cam with customer support.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "rough start but gets the job done", "Author": "Karin Cadario", "ReviewID": "RR4SBJZ2EWCIP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camer so i can monitor my almost 3yr old son and infant daughter since they share a room.Getting it to work was difficult at first because i just couldn't get it to connect to the wireless but then somehow it did it on its own( i know lucky me , i was ready to return it)Then the next problem was getting nightvision to work,  the instructions doesn't tell you that you have to create and account and log in online and select that setting on the website.so that's how i got it to work.My next dilemma is i remember it saying in the description that it has 2way audio, well i do get to hear my son but i can't figure out how to make him hear me!other than that it does the job and you can't beat the price.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "loftek", "Author": "dr", "ReviewID": "R3RY68G283DD2Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great easy to setup & use directly from your Android or i phone simply download the app, plug in camera & connect, low cost without lowering the quality.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simple", "Author": "Harlan R.

All video streams have to be uploaded to seedonk server to view.  This has several negative connotations.  First it takes up bandwidth uploading and the more cameras you use the more it will have to upload.  Second as a security camera apparently you have to buy a subscription for security recording.  Third since all video is uploaded to Seedonk do you really want this as an interior camera that has your daily activities monitored and uploaded to a server you know nothing about?  Fourth, what happens if Seedonk is no longer there or in business?  Fifth, if your internet service goes down so does your security?Exterior quality seemed OK, if you are just looking for a camera to view with your cell phone away from home maybe this works, but it should not be used for or listed under security cameras.  I had to return mine for the above reasons.", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unsatisfied parent", "Author": "PaReNt", "ReviewID": "RQQQCODGUXUB4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "cannot set up this camera to network.
