This thing is a tank, and we were expecting an easy way to move this dome camera remotely around, forget about it. You have to use screws inside the tank to move anything around, and then they tell you to focus the lens that can go out of focus using another screw inside (all the while on a ladder 50 ft in the air?). Yes we could have done a test on the ground, which we did, but to move it where we wanted it to point, etc. For the price, this is in no way different or any better than the less expensive but a few more featured (Dahua IPC-HFW4300S 3MP HD Network Security Camera).For a complete review of this product, see our review on the (Dahua IPC-HFW4300S 3MP HD Network Security Camera) as it has the same features as that camera, but we prefer it over this expensive tank hands down.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$364.48", "Features": "1/2.8\" 3Megapixel progressive scan Exmor CMOS\nH.264 & MJPEG dual-stream encoding\n3.3~12mm varifocal lens\nDay/Night, 2DNR, AWB, AGC, BLC\nIP66, PoE", "Name": "Dahua IPC-HDBW3300 3M Megapixel 1536P HD Outdoor IP Dome Network Security Surveillance CCTV Camera PoE Power Over Ethernet Weatherproof Vandalproof 12 & 24V Dual Votage", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41n4ppj86KL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00HG16K1E"}}
