Has not had any problems connecting to it over wifi (unlike Foscam).  Great low light performance.  My only issue is that when the IR lights kick on, everything gets cloudy which I assume is the lights reflecting back off the inside of the dome cover. Due to this I can not watch the raccooons rummaging through my garbage cans looking for dinner at night.  I am going to take it apart and see if there is a fix but it makes night vision almost useless.  It", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Impossible to mount on a ceiling.
