{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Uses ~60GB of Bandwidth Each Month", "Author": "Kerton", "ReviewID": "R2EO98P7J8ZSRZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My review is focus on one aspect so as not to be too long, but still useful.  **Please note the updates at the end**The Dropcam is a very good, very easy to use device. Many of the top rated reviews here do an excellent job of listing the pros and cons. Also, the firmware has been updated since many of the negative reviews were posted, so there have been subtle improvements (not enough) with motion detection, and also the iOS and Android apps are now easy and great.The best use case of this camera, by far, is indoor remote surveillance of a kids room, a family room, or a workplace.Here's the real, overpowering negative about the device for me: it uses about 60GB of upload data capacity each month. The camera transmits its HD video feed to the DropCam cloud servers ALL DAY, EVERY DAY. The cloud service is what makes the user experience so easy, and what allows you to view your camera from multiple places, phones, tablets, all with just a userID and password. It's good in that you don't have to learn about firewalls, IP port forwarding and such just to make it work. But, that also means that it sends enormous amounts of video of a room with nothing at all happening in it. If your ISP has a quota or a limit to how much you can send per month, this camera WILL DEFINITELY USE A LARGE PORTION. In Canada and with some US ISPs, the limit is 50GB...i.e. less than this camera sends!- Lots of ISPs offer a quota of 250GB, so this camera won't put most US customers over their limit. Just know that this will soak up a good portion of your allotment.- Each additional camera will add to the bandwidth you use.- Consider that you are also downloading the video feed from your ISP, so if you are in the same place as the camera viewing it, it doubles the bandwidth used. Yep, that's right, your video goes up to the cloud server, then back down to you.- FYI, the upload rate is about 400-600 Kbps- The camera does use excellent compression, so the HD video is as compact as it can be in 2012.- If you have anything less than awesome Internet service, the camera will slow down your uploads of other stuff, like photos, attachments, etc. Upload speed is always much slower than download on consumer Internet service, and that's what this camera uses.So, take this important point into consideration. It may still be a great product for you, but you need to know the costs. For me, I planned on using this at a lake house with slow Internet, so it doesn't work for me. I'll have to find another use for it.****Update, September 2012The camera has just received a software update that lets you switch between SD mode and HD mode. All DropCams that are turned on and connected to the Internet will get the update automatically. The standard definition mode uses half the bandwidth of the HD mode. Overall, there is a big improvement regarding the problem I cited in my original review. The update has other benefits in motion detection, etc.As for me, the 30GB a month is still too much, so I will continue to use the available software switch to turn the camera on and off, and only enable it when I want to watch.****Update, May 2014Dropcam keeps on adding features that improve the camera. This is the upside of a cloud service. They can update features on the cloud, and then you get them, even on your older Dropcam. Lately, they've added ACTIVITY RECOGNITION, which is really great. This means that their servers storing your video can recognize certain patterns that tend to occur on your camera, and then distinguish those patterns going forward. An example would be a camera pointed at a front door with the street in the background. The Dropcam cloud might identify cars moving on the street as one activity, and a person walking up to the door as another, and a person walking away from the door as a third. You can then go into the web site, name the activities, and then set up alerts and search on each individual activity. Thus, you could quickly find all instances of somebody walking up to your door, or get a notification each time it happens. Or you could wonder \"What time did the kids leave\" and then filter only by people walking away from the door.

Works as advertised.)", "Author": "Seth Eatinger", "ReviewID": "RRBSYFB2NJUMF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent some time researching the different options (Logitech, foscam, dropcam, adt, x10, cisco, ...) in this product category.  I decided to try out a DropCam HD.  So far (3 days of use), I'm delighted.  The product does everything it promises.It took me about 5-10 minutes to complete the full setup process (open the box to getting video streams online).  In fact, it took me longer to figure out where I was going to put it.Other solutions require special software to be installed and/or a PC/Mac system to be running to capture the video.  I don't want to keep a computer on while I am away on travel + have to maintain/update the software.  The DropCam HD solution removes all this extra effort/time/pain.pros==== - easy to setup (5 minutes of work) - can view online or via android/iphone - can share your camera with friends securely - motion tags allow you to jump to interesting sections - no need for special software or a PC running to capture all the data - surprised by 2way audio feature.  Fun to use while you are away.cons==== - monthly dvr pricing for saved streams (free if you just want live views)still testing============= - low light/night video capture", "Date": "April 4, 2012"},

I was working 30 miles away from home when I received a dropcam alert on my iPhone informing me that my dropcam was disconnected.  When I checked the online recording, it showed the face of the thief who disconnected the dropcam.  When I got home, I gave the police officer a copy of the intruder's face.  Using the photo, the police officers made an arrest on the same night.  Our stolen property has been recovered and we will be retrieving them from the police station where they are being photographed for evidence in a few days.

Without the additional costly recording service you can only view video live.  Other cameras like foscam will send you a large jpeg or short video clip right to your email for free when motion is detected.  Dropcam does have the option of sending a tiny thumbnail of an image to your email when motion is detected but the image is so tiny it is worthless.  This would be a much better product if dropcam would send a bigger image to capture details when motion is detected but Dropcam basically forces the buyer to have to purchase the monthly recording services.  For the buyer who does not buy the monthly recording service, the tiny thumbnail (80x40 resolution) shows so little detail it makes this camera not a good buy for those not wanting to pay an extra $100 to $300/year.  The dropcam company certainly could send a high resolution photo to customers emails when motion is detected.....but they choose not to because they want to make so much money pigeon holing people into buying the expensive additional monthly recording services.  I wish I had known this before purchasing.  I returned the dropcam and am very happy with my foscam camera since it does send me high resolution images for free when motion is detected.  If you do purchase the $300 yearly recording plan, then it works great!

I put it in my living room to see when the kids are home from school. The setup process was done lickety-split, and  all I had to type in was my wireless password (which - admittedly - I had to hunt through a dozen post-its to find). Now I can see it on my iphone and also from my computer at work! Cool!Some details:1. I tried another camera like this before and it couldn't see the entire living room from its perch in the corner. On the other hand, the Dropcam can see almost my whole living room while sitting on the same bookshelf in the corner. Faces appear a little small, but I definitely like being able to see the kids whether they are on the couch or laying on the floor2. The night vision is a really nifty feature. I could just make out my husband on the other side of the room (about 20 feet?). We don't have a big use for it since our kids are older, but it would make a great baby monitor. I guess if somebody breaks in (eek!) we will have the video for America's Most Wanted!3. There's a little clicking noise here and there on the audio (not sure what that is?) but you can definitely hear what's being said ... I had to wear headphones to really make it out though because my laptop's speakers aren't too great4. The talking feature is already a family favorite - at least for Mom, that is ... let's just say I think a lot more homework is about to be done after school and before dinner time....5. It's bee-yoo-tee-ful! I really can't tell you how many of these electronic doo-dads are ugly as sin. It looks and feels like a little art sculpture sitting next to the other knick-knacks on the bookshelf, and the white cable blends in nicely with the wall.I think that's about it!

However, upon setting it up, it worked for less than 15 minutes before it overheated & shut down. (Same problem another previous reviewer reported). I have been unable to get it to turn on ever since.I have submitted a ticket to customer service, over 48 hours with no response so far. I will update my review if they can make it right, however at the moment I am VERY unhappy.EDIT 4/20/12: I gave up waiting for an e-mail back and called customer service. Took about 10 minutes to get through, and after a series of questions, the agent agreed that the camera I had (or possibly the power cord) was defective. He sent me a prepaid shipping label to send it back to them, and immediately sent me out a new unit 2nd Day Air. So big kudos to their customer service team.I received the new unit lastnight, and spent some time playing with it to make sure it was not going to do the same thing as the first one. It seems to be working pretty well so far. My intent is to use this to keep an eye on my baby when he arrives this summer, but for now I am using it on my dog while I'm at work. I have been able to peak in at him a few times today. I really like that you can turn the camera off or on from the iphone app, so it doesn't have to stay on all the time. I also LOVE that the audio is two-way, that was an unexpected bonus that blew my husband and I away! It works very very well.That being said, the device is not perfect, there are definitely some kinks they need to work out. It takes a lot of patience to make any changes or turn the camera off, the settings on both the app and the website are pretty slow to come up. The video delay is only about 2 seconds though, which is what really matters in my opinion. The video is pretty darn clear too, and the night vision is impressive.Occasionally when I turn the camera on or off from the app, it \"freezes\" and I have to back completely out of it and go back in. Not a huge deal since it works once I go back in. Also, it'd be really nice to be able to control the panning/zoom from the app.I'm also stuck with two video feeds in my account now that I had two separate cameras, I went through every available option, and there's no way to delete the non-working one. Annoying.Overall though, as long as it continues to work, it's a pretty cool gadget, and will definitely come in handy with keeping an eye on our little one once he arrives!EDIT 11/19/12:I wanted to come back and update my review now that I have been using the Dropcam for 6 months, 3 months of which have been on our new baby. We absolutely could not be happier with the Dropcam. It stays on 24 hours a day, every day and has caused us no problems with overheating or anything. There have been several updates to the iphone (and now ipad!) apps, and website, and I find them all to be much more user-friendly now. We chose this in lieu of a traditional monitor, and we have no regrets. I especially love that we can leave the baby with a sitter and peek in on him no matter how far we are from home. We would obviously not have that option with a traditional monitor.My one (tiny) gripe is that it does tend to disconnect several times throughout the day and night. Every time this happens, I just have to exit out of the app and go back in. I believe this is more of an issue with our internet connection and/or router, but I wish there was something dropcam could do to make it automatically reconnect whenever this happens.EDIT 12/2/13:We have now been using our Dropcam for over a year and a half, and could not be happier with it! I actually had completely forgotten that the original one we got was defective, because we have never had a single solitary problem with the replacement. It has worked flawlessly as a baby monitor for us & I can't imagine not having it!In my last update here last year, I mentioned that the app would disconnect/reconnect intermittently, that has now been corrected. I don't remember the last time we had that issue. There also was an app update a while back that added an option to automatically turn the camera off/on at a certain time of day. We love that feature & now have ours set up to turn off on weekdays while we are at work.It is also now possible (and easy) to zoom via the app. Everything has become MUCH more user-friendly these last couple updates.So, I'm really glad we took a chance on the dropcam, and didn't give up after the first one was a dud. We LOVE being able to peak in on our little guy via our iPhones while we are out and he's home with a sitter. We have also added the app to Grandmas' phones and they enjoy being able to peak in on him from the comfort of their own homes!Thanks Dropcam!", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dropcam caught my home burglar", "Author": "Rex C.", "ReviewID": "R3M5L6BSQYKD4O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My home and at least three others in my neighbor has been the victim of repeated home burglaries over the last few months.

The Dropcam folks have said that a new native version is coming out in some comments here, and the iPhone app has had a couple of great updates since I installed it, so I'll keep the faith going on Android ... I'm really tired of people who expect it to work on their multi-year old phones though, if you've got some crummy prepaid Android phone from Virgin mobile, blame Virgin not anyone else.Website: The website is really nicely designed, and if anything the mobile apps need to have more of the features that are available on it. Browsing the DVR is much more pleasant, changing settings is easier, and you also use the site to setup your camera in the first place, which is really easy. My only complaint is that I had to upgrade Flash, which is probably OK, I just wish it didn't use Flash at all.Camera: Camera pops out of the base a little too easily, but when I got it all finally positioned on the wall it stayed in place. Night vision works well, though you can see a faint red light from the LEDs. Microphone works OK, a little noisy at first but better when I adjusted the volume. Speaker was a lot louder after adjusting the Flash microphone volume, and now that works well too.Recording: I used to be a big do-it-yourselfer, but now that I'm a \"grumpy old man\" I prefer to compare the true cost of, say, running my own UNIX server in the basement vs just paying for the dang service. I've been using the trial for a couple of weeks, and the best thing is I don't have to keep anything on but the Dropcam and the wifi to get the recording. Some of the other cameras I've used required software running 24/7 on your PC, which is a non-starter if you have a laptop, and a big hassle to keep running all of the time. I've seen a lot of people complaining about the price ... my advice is don't be so cheap. I don't change my own oil anymore, why would I want to administrate a server?Overall I'm very happy, mostly because of the setup, software and service.

I have an alarm system but wanted to also look in when I wasn't there.  The wide angle on this camera provides more of a view than my old Linksys camera and the HD is much more clear of a picture.  I did a lot of research on the latest cameras before I bought this one.  What they don't tell you is the email alerts fire off only about once every 30 minutes, and NOT every time there is motion.  So if a car drives by and creates enough of a light difference I get an email alert.  If maybe 5 or 10 minutes later if somebody walks in the house, there is an event I can view, but it does not email you until about 30 minutes have gone by.  This camera will serve it's purpose well enough so I can check in, and the setup was simple enough.  Another issue I've seen, is several times in just the first few days when I went to login, the dropcam site was not available.  It was only down for about 10 or 15 minutes at a time but I've experienced this several times already.  If it weren't for that, and the email alerts, it would of got 5 stars.*******  I wanted to update this to 4 stars because I do like the fact that you can review everything that happens while this camera is on.  If I were to improve it, I would say add a feature to let people choose whether to get emails for every event, or one within a certain amount of time, like every 30 minutes.  Also the camera has no option to be hard wired, and there is no outdoor camera at the moment.  I look forward to seeing the companies improvements.Update* After a couple of months it does the job to monitor the house and the company seems to have fixed the issues with not being able to log in from time to time but the camera itself does disconnect from the wireless from time to time and has to be unplugged from power.  Today I'm at work on a Saturday and wanted to check on my dog and it says the camera is not connected.  The wireless access point is 10 feet from the camera.  No reason the camera should disconnect from time to time.

I haven't done anything more complex (like trying to have it be viewable from outside my home) but for the basic set up it's great.  It's also really easy to download and configure the apps on PC, Android or iPhone (I tried all three).- The camera is extremely clear- It has pan/zoom features which are really nice, and decent audio.- Night vision (which automatically switches on when there isn't enough ambient light) works extremely well.- There is a notification feature which will send you an email if there is noise or if there is movement detected on the camera.  I haven't gotten it to function as expected yet because it requires that you set the sensitivity properly (which is just trial and error) but this feature is pretty useful particularly when used as a baby monitor.The Cons:- The unit gets extremely hot (not burning, but definitely not comfortable to the touch), even when it is off.  This is the part I don't get - why does the unit stay hot even when you set it to \"off\" in the app and there is no video stream?  I plan to leave it unplugged unless I'm using it, which is a bit of a hassle, but this is just precautionary for my own sanity.- There is a bit of a delay in transmission over wifi with the video/audio.  It's probably only 2-3 seconds of delay with a good signal, but in parts of my home where the signal isn't as strong, it can be up to 15 seconds.  This is not a showstopper for me but fair warning for anyone that is monitoring a situation where seconds matter.- The 'talk back' which allows you to speak through the mic of the camera (two way intercom basically) is good in theory but again the delay makes this hard to use.Overall I would highly recommend this product as it not only serves as a baby monitor but can be redeployed for other uses (as a security or nannycam for example).", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Will Cullen", "ReviewID": "R1PJKOHID863Z8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "29yrs.

I've tried Belkin's Netcam and Logitech solutions, and this one is the best.Why?  It's less expensive the Logitech solutions and much easier to set up.  It has more features and reliability than the Netcam.You start to look for excuses to use it, and feel a little creepy doing it but somehow get used to it.  I use it to watch work in progress on my home remodel, and another one as a permanent surveillance camera in the front of my house.  I even mounted it outside under the eaves of the roof and it has weathered the winter rain and 100 degree heat in my home in the Hollywood Hills (CA).  It is not designed for outdoor use, but it works fine.  No issues at all.It has a two-way mic/speaker that is pretty nifty.  At first I thought it was an afterthought, because the speaker is so small - but it actually works pretty well.It has a nighttime IR mode which works very well.  You can supplement it with additional IR LED's and it picks those up too.  It does get a bit hot though, so be careful when handling it.The mic is very sensitive.  Quality of sound is not that great, but it can pick up everything.The stand is versatile when mounted, since it can be rotated or swung back and forth, with the camera able to rotate in it's mount as well.  The stand has some sort of rubber gasket so it will move but provide enough resistance to keep it fixed.However, it is not the all perfect solution, it does have some drawbacks.  HD quality is nowhere near true HD - it looks good, but it is grainy and has a lot of noise, distortion and artifacts.  Quality of video is not as good as Logitech's closed loop system.  This is something that will be an issue with most streaming solutions.  Also, it does not have an option to route locally through LAN, like Belkin's camera.  The signal ALWAYS goes through the internet, to server and then back down to your mobile app or through the web interface.  So there's several seconds of lag and performance issues, bandwidth hogging issues.  It also appears to have some issues with connectivity - mine tends to drop out from time to time, but can restart itself and keep recording.For the price of the cam and the optional DVR package, it is an excellent buy.  Just think, a few years ago, setting up a camera at home required all sorts of wiring, hookup to a recorder, power connection, etc and even then, very few systems allowed for a remote connection to a live feed.

Stuff getting knocked over, holes in my screen room, and BBs found regularly in the yard. We dealt with it for a few months. We just figured some kids were having some fun nearby and our house was caught in the cross fire. But once we put our birds out back to enjoy the summer air the damage to my property increased. My dog also got \"stung\" by something which left a large welt on his ass. Along with having a baby on the way this was my cue to look into a security solution and or baby monitor. Most systems were just too much hassle for what I needed.I heard about the Dropcam and it looked like a good fit. It's small, inexpensive, high quality, could be used a baby monitor. When I received the Dropcam and I was able to get it up and running in a few seconds. The only problems I encountered was that my WiFi signal on the far end of my house was too weak for the cam to produce a reliable stream. Fortunately, I was able to relocate my wireless router to my more central location in the house which is better for everyone. I then placed the camera in my laundry room window facing out my back porch. The wide angle lens does a great job of capturing the door to my screen room as well as the side yard and gate. Later that night I encountered the second problem which was that night vision doesn't work well at all through glass windows. But that isn't fault of the camera at all. It's just how inferred works.The Dropcam comes with a 14 day trial of the DVR service which I enabled immediately. A few days later we got a hit! We provided the video to the police and they saw it too. When I gave them a longer clip they even spotted a second shot that I didn't see. From their description I was able to go into my yard and find a BB right where they said! These shots were NOT accidental and the police are pursuing action! Needless to say, I now subscribe to the 7 Day DVR Service.I will be ordering another two Dropcams to add to my home. One I'll be facing out front of the house and a second one for the baby when it arrives. The only down side is the DVR service fee is per camera but you do get a 50% discount on additional cams.

They either would stop working, or had other problems which caused them to repeatedly fail. They were also extremely difficult to set up, even for an expert.ProsThe Dropcam is completely different by design and implementation. It's a brilliant product with setup that makes it so easy it's insane.- The quality of the video (compared to the previous cams I've had) is amazing, even in SD mode.- The two-way audio is a nice touch. Works like a charm. I already freaked my wife out while she was exiting the car by having my daughter say \"Hi Mom\" into my phone with the \"push to talk\" feature. She didn't know about the new cam and was looking around the garage for my daughter. She had no clue what was going on! :)- Mounting couldn't be easier. There were no screws supplied, so grab 3 of your own, drill them in and then the base of the Dropcam just snaps into place. Took me 60 seconds.- The software (the iOS app and the website) couldn't be better. The features are everything I need, and more.- I was pleasantly surprised at how fast and well the notifications work (the iOS app uses iOS's native notifications to alert you, which take you directly to the video event to watch). The location aware notifications system is a nice addition, although I haven't had time to test it.- The wide-angle lens on this thing is perfect. I have it mounted on the side in my two car garage, and it captures the entire space with a reasonable amount of distortion.- The USB cable included is very long! Actually for me it's a Con, because the outlet for mine is 2 inches away :)Cons- As many others have stated, there is some bandwidth usage for the DVR service. I did some tests using SpeedTest and here's what I found, using upload speeds as the basis of my tests. Each test was performed one after the other 1) Cam Off 2) Cam in HD mode 3) Cam in SD mode. The upload speeds are fairly consistent, showing the degradation. This is based off of a TimeWarner cable modem. I performed a series of the tests:OFF: 1.91, 1.92, 1.89 MbpsHD: 1.70, 1.73, 1.73 MbpsSD: 1.78, 1.78, 1.77 MbpsEven when in HD mode (using the most upload bandwidth), it didn't seem to affect other typical activities like browsing the web, FaceTime, etc. So while it's a concern, it's not a huge one. It's a necessary evil to have your video stored in the cloud, accessible anywhere, with such ease.- I've experienced intermittent buffering issues with the video streaming to the iOS app, even while at home. When this happens, the video freezes and you get a brief error message across the screen.- There's a Dropcam \"logo bug\" (watermark) which appears in the lower right hand corner of the screen. A nice marketing stunt by the developers, however no security cameras I've ever owned have done this and it's a bit annoying. An option to disable it in a future update would be greatly appreciated.- The back of the camera gets quite warm. We have 95F+ weather here during the summer, so I'm concerned about it overheating. Hopefully it can automatically shut off instead of exploding.- The night vision mode works well enough (again, in my 2 car garage space). It's nothing to write home about, but it's better than my Archerfish cams which didn't have any at all.- There's no outdoor version. According to their forums, they are working on it. You can always stuff it in an air-tight plastic box or pelican case with a hole big enough for the nose of the cam and another hole for the cable.In closing, this camera is so good at so many different things that the few things that aren't so hot are nothing to keep me from using it, and potentially buying a 2nd cam.", "Date": "May 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dropcam HD - Not Perfect but  a very good option", "Author": "LightSick", "ReviewID": "R1Z8W9VH7PO658", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my Dropcam HD for about a year now, since June 2012. And although I couldn't call it perfect, and there have been some annoyances, I've really been pleased with it overall. And I think whether or not one is pleased with it depends on what they hope to use it for (your expectations) and the quality and dependability of your WiFi network.  I would not recommend it's use for critical applications, life or death. For critical applications I would imagine a hard wired system or the need to pay much more for a wireless system.  However for general security, peace of mind and perhaps just broadcasting your life or interests to the world, I think it's a pretty damn good system to consider.  The Good (in my opinion of course);1) Ease of set up and use. After an initial connection with your PC or Mac, you're free to place your camera almost anywhere and begin using it immediately. The limitations are the need for power (DC adapter in 110 outlet, like a small iPhone charging block) and the limitations of your WiFi network (range and bandwidth). It comes with a 10' USB cable so you have some latitude in placement with regards to your outlet location.2) Your mobile / internet connectivity options. You can log in from any internet enabled computer. And mobile apps for either iPhone or Android phones make checking in and remote viewing very easy. I have an iPhone so I can't speak for the Android app. But my iPhone app works very well, even over cellular. It doesn't require a network / WiFi connection.3) The mounting platform(s) are well thought out. Not necessarily discrete but stable. You can simply set it on the table etc, or wall mount it.4) Video Quality. Very good. You have the option of HD (720) or not. The only reason I could think of for not shooting at HD might simply be your WiFi network is just not up to the task. And it's not a great task. I think the minimal required upload speeds necessary for HD use is ridiculously low. I just have a middle of the road level of internet from my ISP (Cox) and I have absolutely no issues with having the necessary bandwidth. You don't need a high end, blazingly fast, remote gamer type connection.5) Camera options control. I'm amazed at how much control options you have. HD or not, microphone on or not, sensitivity, speak remotely through the camera's speaker from across the country / world (\"get out of my house\", \"Hi Honey how was your day\", \"Hi Honey don't forget tomorrow is trash day\", \"Hello Fluffy how was your day\", you get the idea), IR night lights (on or off or auto), digital zoom in any of 5 zones (4 quadrants or center),\"On\" indicator light on/off, motion and/or sound notifications, recently added scheduled auto on/off, and of course the option of 1 week or 30 day DVR recording (I've got the week's worth and think it pretty slick).6) Updates, firmware and additional capability can be delivered, in the background directly to your connected camera. No downloads, re-connecting to your computer or any of that nonsense. Very convenient.7) I've found their customer support to be friendly and fast. I've never had any serious issues although I communicated with them reference #2 below. They were very interested and asked for video clips of the events. Much of the communication was via email which went very smoothly. I honestly believe they would like to develop the consumer \"go to\" solution and take seriously any input from you/me.8) I like the DVR option they offer. For me and my application it's ideal. I don't have to waste space on my computer or deal with added network complexities. It's just there for me to review when I want, as I need to. And although I've only got a week's worth of DVR recordings, constantly dumping old video for new video, I can easily save any video footage I may find of interest to me (or the police), even remotely.  The Bad (or maybe just annoying), again simply my opinion;1) Low light performance. The built-in IR lighting is not going to shock and awe you. After only a short distance it stops being particularly useful in my application. Since I'm using it generally for security purposes I don't even want the relatively bright IR illuminators to be seen and generally have them turned off and leave a light on in the room / hallway. But for other applications, where discretion isn't a priority, I'm certain the illumination may be enough.2) I have always experienced (sporadically) what I call a \"camera blink\". The \"blink\" does not affect the viewing or recording in any significant way. It's only a split second \"blink\" that's not even an on - off. It's simply a very momentary exposure change, a slight darkening then immediately the exposure returns to normal. My annoyance with the \"blink\" is because the camera interprets this as motion, and subsequently notifies me of a motion alert. Since no one else should be in the house I find myself logging in to see the \"burglars\". After a while it can be irritating if there are too many \"blinks\". The \"blinks\" are camera artifacts, not real conditions. But the same effect can be seen if there's a flash of reflected light or passing shadow. Better to be safe than sorry I guess but I'll hope the fine folks at Dropcam will fix this in some kind of update.3) Currently my one camera is near my computer / router etc, connected to my APS in case of loss of power (intentional or power outage). Certainly works fine from there of course. And as that's where my primary \"burglar\" concern is, that's just fine. I did play with placing it in the living room when I first got it. Tried to \"hide\" it amid stereo / TV equipment. I had spotty luck in that regard. Although my network provides streaming from any of the rooms in my house (like Netflix) I was a little surprised with what seemed like spotty performance by the Dropcam. I didn't really experiment thoroughly since I intended it to be in the bedroom from the first. Might have been my network (?) or it might have simply been it's being \"nested\" in the surrounding electronics that provided interference. So in all fairness this (#3) should be taken with a grain of salt since I really didn't conduct any thorough testing at all. Frankly I think it was the electronics surrounding it. Maybe I should just delete #3 but maybe there's some validity to cautioning against adjacent electronics (in my bid to \"hide\" the camera).  Alright, I shamed myself. Should never have brought it up. I just ran around the house with it and all rooms were easily within range and worked just fine.4) But perhaps #3 is a lead in for #4. There is definitely a lag in the video. As you're watching it remotely there is about a second delay. That's to be expected as signals zip back and forth over the network. But the lag is far more pronounced when turning it on. Enough so that you may believe it's not working. That may have been the case a year ago when I was trying it in the living room, amid the TV junk. Maybe it did work but I never allowed it enough time to turn on and connect remotely. I'm accustomed to the lag now. After turning it on when I leave in the morning for work, it will say it's \"off\" or \"not connected\". I'm accustomed to this now but it would drive me crazy before. I'd sit there, turn it on and off over and over, trying to get it to work, check the connections, etc. But it (at least mine) takes a minute or two to actually activate. Before I hit my car in the driveway I'll get the message (emails and notification) that Motion was detected. Seems to do that each time I turn it on. After a minute or so I'll get an email advising \"Motion\" detected. Just it's way of saying \"Hi, I'm finally awake and working\".  So this, in my experience, is just the way it is. There's no instantaneous turning it on. If that's critical to your application then perhaps the Dropcam is not your device of choice. For me it's merely reality and as such I don't really think I can \"ding\" the Dropcam for it. Let this instead simply be a advisory.5) The camera does get warm over time, especially with the IR lights operating. I raise this issue for a couple reasons. The first, and perhaps most important, is potential for a fire if it's not allowed adequate ventilation. I'd really advise against stuffing this into Mr Biggs the teddy bear for covert nanny cam application. I don't know what kind of testing in this respect the folks at Dropcam may have done. I don't know if the camera simply shuts down (and therefore cools down) if it reaches some specific temperature. And I'm not sacrificing or abusing mine to find out. I'm just suggesting that I feel uncomfortable with that scenario and I'd hate to see a flaming Mr Biggs dropping down onto Junior like a comet entering the atmosphere.  The second reason is because I have left mine plugged in for extended periods of time (weeks) and of course it's warm (not hot) to the touch. But a few weeks back I noticed the video image was kind of polarized or solarized (not sure what may be the correct term). The image was there but there were patches of pixelated color, splotches if you will. If I remember it wasn't even \"on\", simply plugged in. When I turned it on I saw the patchy colored image. So now I've taken to unplugging it while I'm at home and not plugging it in until I leave the house. I don't actually \"know\" what caused the image degradation but it hasn't repeated itself. Maybe it just needs to be unplugged every so often and allowed to \"rest\" and cool off. I know I do.  In reality I've had to nitpick a little to find fault with the Dropcam. Half the \"Bads\" really aren't bad, simply observations that I've made over time. I use it almost daily and for the greater part of the day. For my purposes and application I've been real pleased with the camera. To the extent that I am probably going to purchase another one in the very near future. Perhaps a more recently manufactured Dropcam hasn't any of these issues. I bought mine when there was a huge and long back order. What I'd really like to see is Dropcam HD ver 2.0.  I imagine the team at Dropcam is already contemplating a newer version that allows them to address issues that have been noted with the first HD version as well as add capability. That's also why I haven't already purchased a second Dropcam. I know as soon as I do there'll be an announcement that a new, improved Dropcam is shipping the next day.  One reason I've felt compelled to write this is because I've seen some rather flaming reviews in the Apple App store about the Apple app, if not the camera itself. Maybe I've just been lucky. But I have enjoyed the use and capability of my Dropcam HD, and any \"downs\" I've experienced and mentioned above are far outweighed by the upsides. I am less paranoid about someone breaking into my house (my primary reason for purchasing the Dropcam. And if they do, I'll have them on video which I can give to the cops if they don't get there in time to catch them in the act. And I can send the video clip(s) to them from anywhere and right away), And I like the versatility (like watching for a package to arrive and being able to call the neighbor and have them hang onto it until I get home, see whose dog in pooping in my yard (I hope it's the dog) and the list goes on.  Depending on your application, and your expectations, I think you'll actually like the Dropcam and appreciate it's usefulness.

Installed our Dropcam overlooking the baseball field at our local high school.  Now our fans can watch the games whenever they can't make it to the field (on their computers, tablets, or smartphones).I did quite a bit of research before settling on the Dropcam.  Chose the Dropcam becaused it didn't need a dedicated computer, it's wide angle lens, wireless capability (though it's not completely untethered), near HD quality, and above all, the ability for many people to watch all at the same time (well thought out apps). I couldn't find anything else on the market that had the same feature set.  I had the Dropcam setup in minutes, though getting it to work outdoors was a much greater undertaking and not an approved use by Dropcam.I built a weatherproof case and mounted it outdoor on the fence.  The weather in So. Cal is quite mild, so most of the time the camera is operating within it's temperature parameters. I probably would think twice if there were extreme temperature fluctuations.Some things to consider.* The Dropcam is only going to work as long as it can transmit a strong enough signal to your wireless router.  Even if you have strong wifi, the weak link is the signal from the camera. I had to move the router closer to establish a sold link.* You need sufficient upload bandwidth. With little activity, the Dropcam uploads around .2 MPS, jumping to around .5 MPS when the scene is changing a lot.  We're on dsl, so it does have momentary lapses in the picture when there's a lot of field activity.  Somehow the camera buffers video and transmitts when there's sufficient bandwidth so that there's no break in the video when watching on the DVR.*  It's on continuously, so be prepared to use around 60G a month.*  Lighting is the key to a great picture.  In low light, it will be grainy, however on sunnny days the picture is outstanding. Looks best when viewing on an iPad connected by wifi.*  Dropcam needs continuous power.  Though wireless, the camera needs power and so the placement is limited by the location of the outlet and the length of the power cord (~10 feet).* Nightvision is good indoors, say for monitoring your kids, but useless in your window to see outside at night.  The IR will reflect off the glass and obscure the view.For our purposes, it's worked great.  There are some short breaks in the video and occasional buffering issues, but that's part of the territory when using wireless and the internet. If you want to see how good the picture can be, go to the featured cams at Dropcam to see our field (listed as CdM Baseball).", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product but SHAME ON AMAZON", "Author": "chris", "ReviewID": "RLRL714D4UKHP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Shame on Amazon.com for selling refurbished products and not disclosing it to people.Knowing several people who have dropcams and knowing how happy they are with their purchases, I recently decided to buy one.

I ruled out professional installed systems due to cost and monthly monitoring fees. I looked at other wifi based cameras but they needed me to have more computer expertise. The Dropcam HD was the simplest and I think the best option for my needs.It is very simple to set up. Just plug it into your computer's USB port. It registers with the dropcam website and then you put it anywhere in your home you have a wifi signal. It constantly records/uploads to Dopcams site where you can view a live feed for free or pay a monthly fee for it to record and store your feed. We chose the 7 day dvr set up hat stores the past 7 days of recordings. You go to the dropcam website and can view the footage and save clips if needed to your PC/Mac.  It is 9.99 a month or $100 for 12 months prepaid.I really like the free iPhone app because it allows me to view the camera live from any location I have a cell or wifi signal. I receive email alerts when the motion detection is set off with pics.You have the option of hd or sd video. The sd takes up less bandwidth and is still of good enough quality to see what is happening on screen. The night vision is not bad but there is a bit of a glow to the footage.Overall, the Dropcam HD is worth the money and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for an inexpensive way to monitor your home.UPDATE 7/25/13:Recently, the mini USB port on my Dropcam HD broke as I was attaching the cord to it. It just popped off the camera. I called Dropcam support and was treated very well.

For that I give it 6 stars. After setting it up on 2 different routers I've determined that a really beefy router optimizes functionality.LOCAL HARDDRIVE SAVING: the camera does not afford free local access to the video footage, but I have screen capture software, so I can still store my own video on my hard drive. The capture software offers motion detection, so when Dropcam picks up movement - my hard drive will automatically start recording the video feed. I have it set to stop recording after inactivity returns. This saves space on my hard drive. This option however, requires a pc be running during the times at which you might want to pick up motion-triggered activities, and you need a pretty big hard drive or external flash drive. I have 600Gig Seagate. I mainly would use this when I'm travelling and disable it when I'm at home so I don't run the PC all the time.ROUTER:I have Win XP Pro on my laptop and iPhone 5 (6.1 IOS) and have AT&T; DSL. I have a 2 story house and the router is located in the basement (required for satellite tv hookup). The camera is in the kitchen which is one floor above the router. I first hooked this up to my Netgear WGT624 108mbps and it connected briefly but I could never maintain a feed. It kept dropping every 30 seconds, regardless of what channel I used. However, I expected this would be the case which is why I bought a new router at same time as camera. I then installed my new Netgear Nighthawk R7000 600mbps, which is dual band 2.4/5.0 AC (same location). It resolved the issue.SPEED TEST:Router speed tests are the following: in 2.4Ghz I get Ping of 80, Download speed of 1.28Mbps and Upload speed of 0.21 Mbps at my camera location. That is far under the Dropcam recommended upload speed of 0.50 but they *do* say on their website a typical upload consumption is around 0.20 so I guess I just skim the border. My router is on the floor below the camera so I realize these results could improve if I moved the router closer or used a repeater/range extender.HD vs SD:HD setting still made it hiccup and say \"Loading\" as soon as motion entered the room. So I reduced to SD and it resolved the issue. On HD the delay is about 2 minutes. On SD the delay is 3 seconds. Every other device in my house, even in the far corner of the upstairs (2 floors away from router) connect perfectly. But not the Dropcam. I switched most of my other devices to run on the 5.0 frequency to reduce traffic over the 2.4. I imagine the Dropcam Pro would be even worse as it requires more bandwidth with its higher resolution.DELAY:iPhone viewing live and laptop viewing live are about the same delay and image quality. Microphone delay in SD is almost real time, maybe 1 second delay (when I spoke into my iPhone app using the mic feature). Although the response time (from the person speaking into the camera mic) is about 3 second delay. Picture in SD is just fine, colors are great, detail is very good, but details degrade drastically beyond one room in SD. I can make out people, but not face details. But in HD resolution is brilliant across rooms. Since I cannot effectively run in HD I give the camera a 3 stars - and I am running on what is considered one of the most powerful new routers on the market. Overall I am pleased as it does the job I needed. Not exactly how I wanted as I would prefer HD, but it does the job.ALERTS:I initially had trouble with motion alerts and thought perhaps it was because I do not have the paid CVR. But I have now been able to get them to work for free. The issue was my office at work and poor network coverage. Evidently 2 bars of signal on a 4G iPhone is not enough to allow incoming push notification from Dropcam (although oddly enough SMS messages all came in just fine) even when I could see the dog walking all over the place. But as soon as I exited the office, the Dropcam push notifications popped up. I guess there is a different technology for push notificatio transmission than SMS, and it apparently needs a very strong signal to work.In terms of motion alerts delay - I'm fairly pleased, now that I have it working. The delay time on an alert to my phone is about one minute. And email/text both shos up almost simultaneously.11/6/13 UPDATE: I logged a feature request on Dropcam.com.  Currently, you can use the mobile app to manipulate most of the camera settings. However, they still require you to log in directly into Dropcam.com to access certain key features that cannot be accessed from the mobile app.  The issue with this is that when you pull up the Dropcam.com destop app on your mobile phone browser and try to accss the General Settings box as they instruct you to do - it's nearly impossible!! The box will initially appear in the center of the screen but it is literally the size of a postage stamp! I couldn't check any boxes, even with my pinky. So when you pinch to zoom a bit, the box then repositions out of reach. Dropcam support responded within hours (very pleased about that) and said it is a known issue that the webiste is not optimized to be viewed over a mobile device and therefore the General Settins popup box keeps trying to reposition itself out of view and reach of your active view window if you try to zoom in on it in order to change the settings. It's like chasing that little on-screen puppy that moves when your cursor moves!! Maddening! If you're going to be making any remote changes to your phone, you better be sitting in front of a laptop or computer or you are out of luck. I have logged a ticket with them and they responded the same day - so I'm very pleased with response time. They confirmed their website is not optimized for mobile view. It's an easy fix, speaking as a former web developer, so I have high hopes this quick win will be addressed. They can change the popup box to fixed position (if mobile browser is detected). Support is currently addressing this, so I will give them 5 stars for their response time!!!", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE MY DROPCAM!", "Author": "KrisPatt", "ReviewID": "R1W78NGF2JJQCG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We got this in preparation for our first child to be born to use instead of a traditional baby monitor.

A home alarm system is a first line of defense against intruders but, as any police department will caution, a burglar of even minimal competence can probably get in and out of a house before a police car, responding to the alarm, can get there.  A DropCam, however, gives one a video record of an intrusion and, moreover, can supply video of it in real time, which a DropCam owner can view on his/her smart phone.  A DropCam won't necessarily prevent burglaries (though a sign that warns of its presence might discourage them), but the video supplied to police will undoubtedly aid them in identifying and apprehending the burglar.  The long and the short of it is, I suppose, the added peace of mind that a DropCam can provide.  The DropCam, itself, is reliable, easy to install, and easy to use; it is essentially plug-and-play.  Moreover, DropCam offers first-rate technical support.  The company's staff members are unfailingly polite, smart, and helpful.

It also comes with screws/base for wall mounting.  Having a long cable is a must as I already had to return a D-Link camera because the cord was so short that I had to use props to get the camera high enough.

This camera senses sounds and movement, and will instantly alert you by text, alerts, etc (depending on your setup).Overall, this camera has all the features and complete mobile control I was looking for and definitely worth the price.

There are no port forwarding or other router settings to configure as required with the Foscam and DLink camera. After a major power loss this unit automatically reconnects and even sends an email stating the time and duration of the disconnect. That is assuming the camera is fairly close to the router.However after connecting I found that it has a limited Wi-Fi range, the poorest of any device tested.  All other devices including Foscam and Dlink cameras, an iPad, and several laptop computers all connect at least double the distance. Meanwhile the Drop Cam disconnects at less than 20 feet from the router, regardless of placement, and often as low as 15 feet even though my Wi-Fi Signal Analyzer measures between 4 and 5 bars (max signal).  This is most likely due to the design of the Drop Cam Wi-Fi client which has been squeezed into the small camera housing and is lacking any decent antennas. There is no way to increase the Wi-Fi range of this camera. My router is an ASUS RT-AC66u which reliably connects all Wi-Fi devices throughout the entire house and even outside, everything except the Drop Cam. Do not buy this Cam if you plan to install it at any decent distance from the router. Also unlike the Foscam you cannot use a direct LAN connection for this camera. It is either Wi-Fi or nothing and that is often the case - nothing.Be advised that you must pay $99 a year to access the 7 day recording feature and that will only work if the camera does not loose its Wi-Fi connection.

I researched this lag issue further and it seems like it was common and the fix was to buy third-party software (Blue Iris).  Sad.So, I ordered the Dropcam.  I got home from work and set it up within five minutes - just in time for my boy to go to sleep.  This thing rocks! The lag is 2-3 seconds whether I'm in the house, on my commute, or at work.The picture is clear and the camera view is excellent. (I had a little hesitation not getting a camera with motorized Pan/Tilt functions but my worries were unfounded.)Night vision is great as long as you take off the protective film (I was in a rush the first night).The interface on mobile and web is clean and very user-friendly.

I especially wanted to know what the weather was at any given time.

One of those cams is just the beginning of what you'll need to have a full time, on-line webcam that you can view....let alone share friends or family in other locations.Drop cam solves all of that in one very nice package.Plug it into your computer;  give it your network wi-fi information; unplug it.  Take it to where you want it to telecast from (indoors).  Plug it into an AC outlet via a USB/AC adapter and you are DONE!The camera comes with a very long cord,  so your mounting options are many....wall, ceiling, window sill (that where I mounted mine).  With an HD/720P picture and full screen capability,  you really get a great, detailed excellent color picture.All of the camera controls are fully functional remotely.  So I can sit at my house 200 miles away and zoom the camera, change from HD to SD picture, engage automatic night vision and lots more.Best of all, dropcam provides the web server where your camera's output resides.  There is  NO charge for it.  Set up your account and you have instant access to your webcam from wherever you are, and on nearly any mobile media you might be using:  iPad, computer, android, iphone etc.  You can send friends and relatives a link to your webcam and, if you want, you can make it accessible for public views by anyone.Best of all,  Dropcam provides the webserver that makes all this possible at NO charge.  It is literally Plug and Play with NO pay.If you get the impression I'm happy with this purchase,  you're right.

It's small, easy to power and requires no PC or appliance, instead recording video to a cloud service provided by the vendor.On the positive side, this is one of the easier products of its type to install and configure. You connect the cable to your PC, a configuration program starts, you enter your WiFi information and you're done. Really simple, and I'm sure just about anyone can succeed here - no technical skills needed.There's also a mobile app that gives you live view for free, and if you're willing to pay for it, there's a cloud-based DVR that records your video. The device comes with a two-week trial for the cloud DVR service, so you can get a sense of whether it's worth the money.Image quality is good in bright light - less good in dim or high contrast (that is, mix of bright and dim). It may be HD in the sense that it's 720p, but the video stream is so compressed, there's quite a bit of pixelation and muddiness, to the extent that you sometimes can't even tell who you are looking at from ten feet away. Motion is also somewhat jerky and the images tend to be somewhat blurry if there's lots of motion.Still, this is a great device for, say, baby monitoring or keeping track of when the kids get home. There are a few limitations, however.For one, you can't program in multiple WiFi networks, so if you're like me and you have multiple SSIDs where you want to use the device, you need to plug it into a PC to reconfigure and time you move between networks.Second, the device stand is fairly large and cumbersome given the size of the camera. Yes, you can remove the camera itself and find a way to mount it without the stand - but with the stand (as pictured in the product description), it's a bit too large to be unobtrusive. For example, although I have wide windowsills, the base of the camera is a bit too wide to sit on one of them.Also, the camera itself is not weather sealed and so it's pretty useless for outdoor monitoring. You really can't, for example, park it looking outside a window - the night vision simply reflects off the glass, giving you glare instead of clear outdoor pictures. It's very much an indoor only solution.I have mixed thoughts about the cloud recording approach you get with Dropcam. While the live viewing is free and easy to use from a mobile device, recording is expensive and error-prone, and you're locked into the Dropcam service. I suppose I'd pay $99/year for it if it worked reliably, but I'm not so sure this is the case. Although it advertises it keeps the last seven days of video online, my experience is that you get way less than 50% coverage within that seven day period.The cloud recording approach Dropcam uses is also dependent on lots of bandwidth. I have Verizon FiOS 50mb service - generally screams, but I still couldn't get reliable cloud recording with this device. When I go back and look at the recorded video stream, there are too many \"No recording available\" segments. As other reviewers mention, you will definitely need to be careful if you're on an Internet plan that limits your monthly usage. Plus, it's hard for me to imagine getting good results with multiple cameras on a single network.Unlike some other cameras that support various network and device standards, there's no way to simply run some PoE network cables to these devices and control them with your own choice of software. You're pretty much locked in to the vendor's apps and network services.There's also flaws in the motion detection software.Another vendor I tried was able to sent me an alert exactly as motion was detected - I could see the person triggering the event, and I really wouldn't have to search through the video stream to figure out what was going on.Not so with the Dropcam. In the first few weeks I owned it, I've had perhaps 100 motion alerts, and exactly zero have depicted the actual person or object triggering the alert. In most cases, because of the holes in the recording, it's rare to find the cause of the alert by reviewing the video stream online. I find this to be very frustrating: you get an alert that the camera detected motion, but you're not able to see what the camera saw.Bottom line is that the Dropcam offers great packaging, simple setup and a good solution for live viewing an indoor object, so long as you have lots of bandwidth.

You are left most of the time either with either excellent video quality and an impossible to set-up network configuration or just the opposite.  Try to add iPhone (or other smartphone device) for monitoring and you've just made your hunt nearly maddening.  Thankfully, Dropcam made a remote camera I was looking for...and possibly you.The first things that impressed me about this Dropcam was it's price, video quality, and iPhone app.  Based on the reviews and TWiT networks stamp of approval, I purchased one to give it a try.  I wasn't disappointed upon delivery.  The packaging is nicely organized and looks sharp.  It was easy to removed the camera and USB cable.  I quickly plugged it into my Mac and opened the USB drive image and was immediately configuring the camera in three easy steps.  In less than a minute, my camera was configured and ready to stream to the Internet.I moved the camera to the baby's room and positioned it pointing down in a very low angle.  The base held its ground and the camera didn't fall over.  Nice.  I then took out my iPhone, opened the earlier installed Dropcam app, and quickly logged into my camera.  In seconds, I had it perfectly positioned and left the room.  The test came when my wife put the baby down to sleep.We opened the app and took a peek at what was happening.  The video clearly showed our 10-month-old not happy with his nap time and the audio prefectly transmitted his cries.  Both video and audio were sharp and accurate.  He finally gave up his protest and fell asleep.  We watched for a few minutes and then closed the app.  Both my wife and I kept checking on him from within our home network and later my wife while at the store without ever having to make an adjustment to the Dropcam app.  A little over and hour later, we both received an alert message on our iPhones that movement was detected.  I opened my iPhone and there was my little boy sitting up, in a fresh awaken daze.  My wife went to get him out of his pen before he began crying to notify us that his nap was done like he previously would.  Now, we know before he knows we know. :)So why did I entitled this being shy of incredible?  Well, there are a few quirks that need to be resolved.  First, the zoom on the iPhone is very kludgy.  You must go into the Settings and then select a section (bottom left, center, top right, etc) to zoom into.  There is no way to zoom while viewing the video like you can from the website.  Second, when you use the built-in speaker to talk through the camera, you lose audio.  There is no two-way communication.  Third, and it's less than a quirk and more a complaint, is that the DVR feature is pricey.  You have three option: Live streaming only for free; seven-days of video per month for $9.95, or 30-days for $29.95.  That's over $300 a year per camera if you desire to use this for security reasons.  Ouch.  One other cavet is bandwidth consumption.  Most ISPs now cap your total usage and this camera will quickly get you closer to that cap.  Add a couple or handful to the mix and you'll be looking for another provider.That said, I love this camera and will be purchasing another one if not a few more.  It comes with a mount so I can easily snap the camera onto the ceiling or move it elsewhere at will.  Because it uses Micro-USB for power, you can pretty much power this anywhere with a simple adapter including from your car! (Road trips can become interesting if you're hotspot has a great plan.)Sleek looking, easy to configure, solid mounting options, and dream-like access from any internet enabled device, Dropcam is now pretty much my only remote camera.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "OK engineering, lousy business model", "Author": "Maynard Handley", "ReviewID": "R3EYKOH8CJE5OE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have to say, I'm disappointed by many aspects of this product, too many to recommend it.On the engineering side, my primary complaint is that it runs hot. Running hot was OK in consumer electronics of ten years ago, it is not OK in 2013. We have a world where companies like Intel, ARM, Apple, Samsung, or Microsoft are all working hard every day to reduce power consumption and excess heat. Then we have a company like Dropcam, who apparently feel they don't have to be part of this trend, they can slap together whatever random (cheap) electronics they can find, and if the result runs hot and wastes power, well it's not their problem.On the business side, you have to be aware that Dropcam are not interested in selling you a camera, they are interested in selling you an ongoing subscription (costing at least $99 a year) to their service. They have done everything they can to ensure that this product is useless without that service. So, for example, their appears to be no way (at least on a Mac) to register the device as a standard camera and run your own software which utilizes it. If you complain, I'm sure Dropcam will cry copiously about the expensive cost of running servers, and how they are losing money storing your video at \"only\" $99 a year. What they will not point out is that they give you NO CHOICE in this matter.On the combined engineering + business incompetence side, a byproduct of lousy engineering and the hostile business model is that they do no motion detection on the camera (and, of course, provide no way to delegate this task to one of the computers in your household). Which means that the camera is, every minute of every day, clogging up your WiFi connection and then your internet connection, sending out its stream to their servers. Just like energy efficiency, the attitude appears to be \"why should we care about efficiency --- you're the one who has to live with the consequences\".The crazy thing, of course, is that the camera obviously has to have motion compensation hardware in its video compression chip --- and it should be trivial to hook up that motion comp cell to report motion detection when the motion comp energy across a frame exceeds a threshold. With just the slightest concern for creating a quality product, they could have simultaneously somewhat reduced power consumption and substantially reduced bandwidth consumption, all using hardware that already exists in the camera!Unfortunately that's the problem with new companies. You often can't tell until after you buy if they're populated primarily by engineers, proud of the job they've done and anxious to do even better, or by MBA/marketing types who don't give a damn about quality as long as they have your money. Of course, sadly, you CAN tell once you have paid...One final thing should be added. An earlier version of my review complained about the lack of use of push notifications and geofencing on iPhones.Both of these features DO in fact exist, but Dropcam does not go out of their way to tell you about them or to make their use obvious. Should you want to use them, the best solution appears to be to run a google search for the feature of interest.", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera Horrible support", "Author": "J.

It does both infrared at night and color during the day.4. My husband who works out of state can talk to me on it from his phone... which is awesome because that means he can talk to the baby while watching the baby online while he's away.5. I will buy the $99 monitoring package for the year once the baby comes, but there's no need to have that beforehand.6. The Android app alerts me when there's either movement or sound and the sound sensitivity can be adjusted if you live in a noisy neighborhood or really quiet one. (we live across the street from a park, so I turned the sensitivity down so that it doesn't pick up the soccer team or the mail man).7. During the free trial period, I played with the clips of recorded video and sharing those, and it was easy peasy, I was really happy with that.8. I can give access to out-of-state relatives who want to see the baby for a day or whatever so that they can see, but can then take away access when I want the privacy, and the UI is all really user-friendly.9. Some reviews warned about how it eats up all of their bandwidth or something like that, but I haven't seen any slow down at all and I upload and stream video a lot.

My Brother also owns three dropcams. So this is the deal with dropcams: First of all, they are very high quality cameras for home security. The HD resolution has set a new benchmark in this area of home and/or business security. The camera setup is very easy and once you have completed it you can forever disconnect the camera from your computer because each individual dropcam will now \"recognize\" your broadband router. This is a huge advantage over other systems because you no longer have to keep your computer running 24/7 and the power consumption of each camera is quite minimal. The cameras run off of a USB power cube typical of the iPhone variety. The power cord is long enough that for most positioning applications there should not be a problem. My Brother runs two of his cams with extension cords due to the distance from the power source. He has not reported any problems with this setup. So overall, the setup procedure could not be easier. After a very short screen setup procedure, the average time from box to operation takes about ten minutes. In the eight months of continuous operation my two dropcams have not had any major issues as far as picture quality, night vision capabilities or sound quality. The motion detection capabilities and time bar marker have worked perfectly and have been quite handy in checking back to review video clips. My Brother and I both subscribe to the remote \"cloud service\" offered by dropcam. This gives you a continuous seven day loop of all video captured by your cams. Now for the only complaint I have about the dropcam: You absolutely MUST have a VERY STRONG broadband signal in your home or business to ensure continuous and consistant operation of these cameras. Of the five cameras we have in different towns the same problem occured numerous times. The cameras will NOT work properly if your router is not putting out a strong signal and is in CLOSE proximity to the actual cameras. It took us both a couple of weeks to figure out why the cameras broadcast signal kept dropping out. The issue seems to be with the cameras inability to capture a marginal router signal. Where other electronic items such as phones, ipads and laptop computers have no problem capturing the exact same signal strength, the dropcams just can't recieve it for some reason. At first I thought I may have a defective camera but all five of our dropcams have the same issue and all five are in completely different settings using different brands of routers. We finally solved the issue by purchasing new top of the line \"N\" routers and positioning the routers so that there was no more than a thirty foot distance between the router and cams. This completely solved the issue and aside from some momentary signal dropoffs from time to time we have had excellent service from these cams. So overall I am giving dropcam four stars. It has solved all our home security issues. They are available for viewing on our Iphones, Ipads and all home computers instantly from anywhere. The video quality is excellent and once correctly set up have proved to be very usefull.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Internet Based Video Camera", "Author": "Stuart H. Warren \"Reader1\"", "ReviewID": "REWU2XU68UMQK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received this product yesterday and found several issues.First, it works and is easy to set up. It is wireless, once you get it \"configured\" and authenticated on your WiFi router.It can't do ANYTHING without the internet. There is NO internal buffering in the event that it can't get to the internet...So, as far as security, get a $30 WIFI jammer and no video recorded...It takes a lot of bandwidth to run when the resolution is at its highest. If you want to use it as a babycam, with the camera in the other room, the video leaves the camera, goes out into the cloud where it is recorded and then you can see it. So you hear the baby crying a good 15 seconds through the wall before the computer.. Also, since you're using 2x the internet bandwidth, forget anyone else using netflix, hulu or VuDu to stream video.No way to set up triplines (zones that cause recording)No way to have it do motion detection without telling you every time it sees motion. If you turn off motion detection alerts, you also turn off the detection capability, and the web site does not show when there was motion. There is a big difference between detection  and alerts. In their simplification, they have bundled it on a single on/off button.No local storage in the event that there is internet congestion. The Mobotix is a much superior camera since it has local storage and can also send it offsite. (I know it costs 5x the cost but it works, except Mobotix has to heater...). it should at least have some local storage and cache the video in the event of an internet outage or problem.The big metal base is OK, except if you want it looking out the window, since the base is circular and the mount pivot is in the center of the base, it sets well away from the window and interferes with drapes, blinds, etc. There should be a way to mount it to the window glass (small cylinder of plastic with a flat flange and double stick tape) Stick the mount to the window and snap in the camera. I guess I could double stick tape the base to the window and fold the camera flat for a minimal depth mounting.Due to the bandwidth needed, we stepped the resolution down to the non-HD level and it still looks decent and doesn't hog the internet connection. There should be a setting that compares the average of 5 frames and unless there is a 5% or something configurable different, then skip recording the same image to the internet. To bolster that, add a circular queue and allow the system to back track 10 seconds before the motion event for no-loss recording.There should be some method of connecting locally to view the camera and there isn't. Apparently the video is encrypted leaving the camera and can't be decrypted unless it goes through their website. Why not use the same code as a java script download to view it locally?I had planned to use several but now think a more traditional camera would be better suited for our purposes. By the time you buy more than 2 of these cameras, and the annual DVR costs, you're in the same price range of many wired camera systems with local storage and internet access.If you have lots of internet bandwidth and it's rock solid, then you're probably OK with this product.", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "dropcam is the perfect name.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R5QXMGRBXJUXM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It (actually both of them that I bought) continuously dropped off the network.Support was slow to non-existent so they went back.When they did work video quality was good, but they didn't work well enough.", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not going to work for me", "Author": "Wildlife Watcher", "ReviewID": "R20F0N66WV8FTI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Dropcam definitely has an easy setup, but if you have other wireless devices in your home either the dropcam wont work or your other wireless devices wont work.

The interface is very basic as others have said. If you wish to zoom in you have to go into settings and your allowed to choose upper right, upper left, lower right or lower left as options and then the camera will be zoomed in on that area which I didn't really care for. If I was at the store which is a five minute drive from our house and went into settings I could reconnect with the server for some reason, when I was receiving video prior to entering settings.

Darn birds/rabbits/clouds/???.", "Author": "Wackadoo", "ReviewID": "R174JH96076FV5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this to monitor my front door and record/alert when somebody was at the door. I wanted to go back in the DVR to see who was there when I was sleeping (I work nights) and when I didn't feel like going to the door to see who was there (letting them know I was home).Positioning & false Motion Alerts:It's easily positionable to catch my porch area, however the camera doesn't have a feature to \"ignore\" certain portions of the captured image so as to not always send the constant and numerous false Motion Alerts that I was getting due to traffic on the road/sidewalk. I haven't played with the digital zoom feature to see if that would work to exclude those portions because the image from a CCD of this size is already grainy enough (although the image quality is generally OK). Also, I was getting constant false Motion Alerts due to birds, rabbits, and the occasional cloud shadow moving across the front yard. There were even times when a Motion Alert would come across, and try as I might I couldn't see a darn thing that caused it. For this kind of application, the DVR and Motion Alerts are of limited use.Night Vision:In order to catch the front porch through a window, since the camera is not rated for outdoor usage, the night vision IR emitters are conveniently reflected off the window. Modern windows are designed to keep that type of energy in. This turns the window at night into a mirror, making it absolutely impossible to see anything outside with the IR night vision turned on. With the porch light on, the camera works ok for the immediate vicinity that the light reaches. With the light from street lamps, the camera can barely see shadows and faint images but not any detail worth using to identify people. Once again, for this kind of application the camera has limited utility.The iPhone app works pretty good. Since nearly all of us have our phones on our person/within reach, when I'm home it's nice to take a peak to see who's at the door. When I'm away the app ultimately has limited utility since all the extraneous Motion Alerts at the front door forced me to disable that feature.Where it might work better:As a nanny cam or as an indoor security camera this camera would work ok. It isn't a large camera, but it isn't small either so placing it in a discreet location would work OK in some cases. If you have pets/children the Motion Alert would have very limited applicability. It would work great as a baby monitor and if you used the Motion Alert feature it may even let you know when little Timmy/Tammy was awake. The cloud-based DVR feature, being a for-fee service at $9/month for a single camera ($4.95 for each additional), would have to be something you really need in order to get any benefit from it. For a parent/family the iPhone app would have a few helpful uses I'm sure.Overall for me, this isn't the best solution. If it was outdoor rated or had a protective non reflective bubble to encase it in to protect it from the weather it would be more useful. Also, if I could crop the motion sensing feature to exclude certain parts of the image and decrease the sensitivity of the motion sensing it would work better for me. Since I've already paid $149 for it though I can't very easily drop this cam for something else (pun intended).", "Date": "June 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Useful Security Camera for Travel", "Author":

It takes a lot of trial and error to connect.  It's also very awkward to connect it when the cam is in the stand.

I have my camera pointed indoors in an office and the very slow moving shadow created by the light passing through the window as the sun sets will trigger half a dozen alerts in the evening .  I can't imagine using the motion alert if the camera is pointed outdoors, where the slightest move of the leafs on a tree is going to trigger an alert.  There is no way to adjust this setting (ignore a quick movements of small objects (e.g. leafs) but register movements of larger objects (e.g. delivery truck)). Hopefully this is a SW feature that will eventually be updated.  Until then, the number of false positive alerts has me ignoring the camera's emails, which kind of defies the purpose.  I also wish they'd offer a cheaper plan where you store the video for s a shorter period than the one week ($99/year) or one month ($300/year).  The camera will send you a photo when it detects movement, but in my case, that often is simply the door of my office being opened.

Somewhat frequent dropping off the network, but usually getting back on within a minute.Terrible pink ghosting in image with any brightish light from the lens (opposite from the center of the image from the light.  And reversed).What triggers sound alerts and doesn't is a bit flakey for me.  Sometimes a house creak will send an alert, other times even a minute of loud beeping from setting the house alarm in the other house will not trigger a sound event.One thing driving me a little crazy is even though I have sound  alerts turned off currently, for example I just got woken up from a deep sleep from the alerts from the other house when someone called that phone as a wrong number.  Not the first time it has sent sound alerts when supposedly turned off. At first I thought I was mistaken, but now it is very clear that this is buggy.Sometimes I receive the alerts right away, sometimes it takes up to 5 minutes, and some times I get nothing.  Haven't figured out the pattern yet to isolate variables like my different emails (google, msn, etc).Also I really wished they support alerts to a verizon w8 phone (just talking a text here) better, I get about 1/10 of the alerts directly to my phone.  Not sure why that is so spotty, maybe something to do with my specific phone (928) and carrier and the text format.  But all other emailed texts to my phone seem to work fine (I have other apps emailing the phone texts with no problem). This a problem for me, as getting alerts to my mobile is a major part of what I wanted.And dropcam says there is a 30 minute alert timeout between alerts per camera.  I am getting motion alerts often as often as 15 minutes for a single camera, sometimes at the 30 minute intervals. Another area that dropcam needs to spend some resources on, imo.  For any \"security\" system (which is why I bought it) needs to be reliable and predictable.So kind of flakey in the implementation, but I love the basic idea of the dropcam.  So handy to have the ability to get info on our other place while we are gone when it all working (currently camera has gone off line at other house, for example).  While wi fi connection is spottier than I would have expected, when working it gives good video although it does eat up alot of upload bandwidth which would make multiple cameras a problem for us at either house as we only have around .7 - .8 mbps upload.And I love the concept of the ability to view the stream at any time and see the sound and motion events, even with a subscription fee.  If it all worked a little more solidly, the cost would be well worth it to me.At some point down the road I think it could be a killer product, but not yet imo.  But still pretty cool and if I could I'd give it 3.5 stars.edit: I  heard back from dropcam support and they said the pink flare in the lens is considered normal in the dropcam. I consider this kind of reflection only normal in a poor quality lens.  For whatever reason, the dropcam pro does not have any of this flare under identical conditions.Also having a bit of problem keeping my dropcam HD connected.  Currently it had been offline for two days and we have not  had a chance to go there and get it reconnected.update 12/3  Camera is now dropping off network every few minutes and then reconnects (which results in a motion alert).  And then after a couple hours it quits entirely. Tried rebooting modem, camera etc and behavior is the same.  After I am away a few hours the camera goes offline (sometimes it seems to actually sbut off. So for me it's of no use and is going back. Also to work at all I had to put it the same room as my modems (same for both houses) with no walls between them at all.

I contacted drop cam and they tried to help me out by trying different solutions such as moving camera closer to modem ( which isn't always possible as in my case ) changing the channel on your modem to a less busy one which I did and then they eventually sent me a new camera.  Unfortunately none of these solutions worked.  I do not recommend this for a baby monitor which is one of the ways it is marketed.

The picture quality in HD (have not tested SD) is very good, the night vision can be a bit blurry but still good quality.  The dropcam app - you can access the app via I-phone and I'm sure via any Android as well. For the I-phone you have to  go  thru settings first in order to turn on/off the camera (one/two extra steps...could be easier). Once the camera is on you don't  have to be in close proximity to view it - you could be miles away.  The built in microphone picks up sounds very effective and the background noise (static) is minimal.  Tech Support: Overall the tech support is helpful and tries to figure out quickly how to resolve the issues ( I tested e-mail  only). The online help knowledge base is very limited in my opinion.Con: WiFi issues - this seems to be the biggest problem with my camera. I have FIOS cable so my internet connection is very fast  as is the WiFi. Unfortunately the camera doesn't work very well if the router is not within the same room or if you have a 2nd  story right above it. We had the camera upstairs above the router and the delay on the camera picture was about 3-5 sec.  on average. That's a bit long in my opinion especially if you're using it for your kids. Now that we moved the camera to  another room the WiFi is very spotty. I am constantly getting a message \"Camera disconnected....\" although we have WiFi in  the entire house without problems. We also bought a WiFi booster but for some reason it's not helping either - check back  for updates on this issue.  After the latest software update whenever I turn the camera on it shows a picture from the last time it was on and not a \"live\"  pic - solution is to close the app and open it again. Annoying!!!Final review:Overall the dropcam is a very nice good working camera, very expensive for just one camera, but the quality of the live streaming video is usually very good in either daytime or nighttime conditions. The biggest problem is the WiFi but maybe this can be solved via a WiFi booster - we are currently experimenting with it. Would I recommend this camera?I think overall it's a good product but I would research some more before I would buy this pricey one.Check back for WiFi booster experience update.", "Date": "November 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Cam but a Big Appetite for the Upload Bandwidth", "Author": "Road King", "ReviewID": "R2TGTVTV2FTFDJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The setup is super easy and the design, size, picture angle and quality is really good but this dropcam is a hungry little devil when it comes to upload bandwidth.  That can cause some issues for you.  I set the unit up in less than 5 minutes from box to view.  The remote view from my iPhone and Ipad was great but I soon found that my internet was cutting out... a lot.  I have just switched from TW to ATT and have the top speed package they offer.  I had noticed a slower browse speed with ATT than TW so with this new internet drop issue I decided to call ATT Tech support to see where the problem was.  They were extremely helpful.  I found out my router channel was not properly set by the install tech and they led me through a re-channel procedure that helped tremendously in boosting my download bandwidth to 18+ Mbps and upload to 1.6+ Mbps.  ATT is known for slow upload speeds but my speed test showed that I was back to where I was suppose to be based on the package I pay for.  Even with that adjustment it kept dropping out when the camera was connected.  Disconnect the camera and it was fine.  Dropcam Tech support (very good by the way despite it being all email based) took me through several iterations of moving the camera closer to the router and then farther away.  Distance from the wireless router makes a HUGE difference.  One floor up and almost overhead of the router and the internet connection drops frequently with 2 iPads and 2 iPhones also drawing signal.  Moving the cam to the same room as the router the signal is steady with no drops over a 24 hour period.  Moving the cam to the opposite side of the house (~40') and on the same floor and the internet drops a lot.  So if you are going to locate the cam over 30 feet away or on a different floor from your router you may run into frequent signal drops.  I am also sure that running more than 1 of these would bring my internet to its knees.  Bottom line, if your ISP gives you plenty of upload speed and you keep the camera located fairly close to the router you will be very happy with this Dropcam.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for spying on your kids.

(average delay is 15 seconds) This is unacceptable for a Baby Monitor, so is impossible to have a DropCam to monitor a Baby with this delay!!!!

Other than that the only real cons are that you can't remotely pan/tilt the camera and, for the digital zoom, the screen is divided into 5 pre-set sections rather than allowing you to select any centerpoint you want. A final, fairly minor con, is that the IR transmitters glow red rather than being invisible to the naked eye. Not a big deal, but a bit annoying.Then we added a wifi extender and adjusted the channel of our wifi network and everything changed. This now works perfectly.

Being able to intervene even though there would be a full time caregiver with him made me feel a lot less guilty about taking the very necessary trip I had planned. I loved the advertised idea that it could pan, zoom and tilt as well as having a conversation via the product.Sadly, it was not to be.I bought and installed it about 10 days in advance of my trip. First off, it doesn't really pan or tilt -- neither does it really zoom. It's all digital so you can't get the same zoom result as with the optical zoom on your camera, for instance. You can move it around, tilt it, hang it on the wall, set it on a dresser -- but I never found a way to alter the view from either my smartphone or from the dropcam website. So that was disappointing...Although it found and linked to our Xfinity wifi/wireless router, the connection was never great or consistent. And on the very morning that I was leaving, I woke up to a solid red-orange light. I checked on the website, read the guide(s) and found that it means it's trying to connect to the router. Or you don't have internet service. Or your router is broken. I tried 2 laptops, a tablet, a desktop and my smartphone and every one of them connected with zero problems. It wasn't our router. It was the dropcam.Here is a summary of the issues I found with the dropcam:1.  Zoom is digital so you can zoom to a particular area on the display, not zoom in on the subject itself.2.  Video is grainy even on the best day so you can't really see facial expressions, which for me was a big deal.3.  The audio is extremely delayed -- probably 3-4 seconds minimum and it was not good audio so hubby rarely understood what was  being communicated to him.4.  The camera (the black part in the center of the metal stand) is made of a plastic housing with whatever components inside -- it gets HOT... REALLY hot.If it were to work, here are the pros that I can imagine being important to buyers/users:1.  Easy setup via a provided cable, a quick account set-up and logging in to the dropcam site.2.  Sturdy stand that can be mounted in multiple ways.3.  Decent smartphone app to interface with unit.4.  Additional interface available at any time via the website.5.  Ability to upgrade to a paid plan that allows archiving of video taken by the dropcam.6.  Night vision feature.7.  Wireless -- plug into any electrical outlet after initial setup and you're good.Needless to say, I disconnected the unit the morning of my travels and, as soon as I returned from my trip, I contacted Amazon and returned it. They refunded my money immediately -- the return process was about as simple as it could be.After reading through many of the reviews on the Dropcam, I'm just not sure it's ready for prime time... I know that, for me, when I needed it most, it failed. I won't be replacing it or trying again. I may see what other types of cameras are available with our Xfinity Home Security and maybe that will be a better solution for us.", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Frances M.

There are only 3 things to do on the 5 by 5 setup card and it only takes about 30 minutes including installation of the apps on the phone. I am basically very impressed.I see that there are a lot of reviewers with big issues and my complaints here are very minor. First, after you complete the setup there is no desktop shortcut to the camera. You'll need to create your own link to [...] and login. You also need to look on their website where to find info for your Android app. It is obvious to most folks, but it would be nice to know just what app to look for and where to go in the setup. I also noticed that the camera gets warm. Not really an issue, but it does.  The difference between HD on and off is minor, but the video/audio delay is less. I noticed too that the images have a purple tint in areas similar to what other users have mentioned, but I think this is because of the color difference between incandecent and fluorescent(CFL) bulbs. And yes the nightvision isn't great. It is acceptable though. In the app, the \"zoom\" off button is off screen at the top. Scrolling up is not what I expected to do. After changing the zoom to center and then back out the camera changed to center zoom by itself. Am I nit picking?At this point the benefits far out weigh the minor things in my review. 5 stars easily still in my book. I went through the port forwarding issues with the Foscam camera I bought before this one which only worked for a couple of weeks before changing IP address.

It's advertised that you can speak through your phone (or miked laptop/desktop) through the camera's speaker) and from my experience you can, but it's really very sporadic and difficult.  Some of the words get cut off.  Don't expect to hold a conversation. There's too much lag (4-5 seconds)and that's to be expected with the software/hardware architecture and at this price.  The audio from the camera microphone to your phone or laptop is good to very good.There are two issues that you must be aware of.  Why there is no app for the iPad is beyond irritating.  There is an app for the iPhone and Android that works great.  This MUST be fixed.  And, after the initial 2-week trial period you'll have to subscribe to Dropcam for the recording feature. This is something like $10/month for 1 week history and $30/month for 30-day history. I'm close on those figures.  For now, I'm opting for real-time viewing only.

Also, I need to upgrade my 5-year old wireless router since occasionally, the driveway camera, which is furthest from my router (about 40 feet, through several walls), loses its wifi signal. But the range is pretty good (could be a little better) and with a longer-range router, it should be fine. I really like that I can monitor the cameras on my iPhone, even with just a 3G signal. Dropcam has been really good about updating their app with new features (twice since the camera was released six months ago). Plus, you can set up the app to alert you when the camera detects motion or sound (or both). That comes in real handy when I'm traveling. Once, I was 600 miles away and was alerted to the driveway cam and saw that the oil company was trying to fill my tank in the spring (and I only need oil for heat).

The video quality is outstanding. The produce design is great. The size is good and all the parts for mounting the camera are well designed and do the job. Set-up is elegant and simple. I placed the new Dropcam HD fairly near the older model I had mounted. My WiFi coverage is good in this location for any other device I own. The new HD keeps going off line. I returned the first unit and received a replacement. The replacement doesn't go offline quite as often. However, it does go offline. This is very annoying, especially if I am going to be away or traveling for several days. This last time when it went offline I did nothing and it came back on after several hours. This is my biggest issue with this device.Customer service is outstanding. I always get prompt replies to email or telephone contacts. Customer service seems very quick to offer a replacement, but not too interested in trying to find out what could be causing my problem. This doesn't help me make any adjustments with a new unit to try to figure out what could be improved. Now my unit is out of warranty.The web site is pretty but confusing. I could see a discount offered for a year's recording, but I could not find any way to get the discount. I finally called customer service. They again promptly solved my problem and gave me the discount, but I haven't seen any changes on the web site.I would like to see a more reliable product, or a better explanation of what to do when the DropcamHD goes offline. Does it have  built-in error correcting? Can I just wait for it to come back? Is there a way to get the unit to self-correct if it doesn't? Now, it isn't recording. Do I call customer service? Did they forget that I am paid for a year?

The cloud storage concept is excellent, (The burglars can't steal the images of their own burglary.) Pricing is fair.Problems:1) wifi range is disappointing. If the camera is not line of sight to the router, I get frequent cutoffs that require power cycling the camera to re-establish monitoring. Replacing the camera did not help, (although tech support was friendly, helpful, and prompt.)2) The video driver for android is pre-beta. Red/green/blue images are offset, making the image mostly useless. Also, the time line that is so handy on the pc website view is not seen on my android view.3) choices for being informed of video or audio events (email or text) are either all or nothing. Being able to limit messaging to particular times of day would be very helpful (I don't need a text every time my secretary makes a copy).4) a weather proof housing attachment/option would make the camera much more useful for home and office.5) the public cameras are pathetic: tired puppies or office window views.So, a promising product, but a work in progress.

Okay, good IP camera and high quality video. Now for the rough parts. Yes this is a good video feed, but it also causes my entire bandwidth to be sucked up and my Netflix has to rebuffer. Sure you say, fix your dial up! But I have a regular 7-12 MBps download and 1 mb upload. Well upgrade then?! Wait this should not be showing the outside of my house every 30 seconds. I only want real motion, cars, people and animals. Why do I have a time lapse of every minute? Not efficient use of storage or having to scroll through a days' worth of video. So, I made several adjustments to the video and it is still uploads way to much. So, the motion sensor is way too sensitive I think. The night vision is cool, but you have to be ready for the IR circular lights to be on all the time. Also, the video device gets extremely hot. Almost to the dangerous point if you leave it somewhere concealed and not enough air to circulate. So, I will have to forgo this device. I would rather have a timer that turns it on and off during certain periods I can choose. 24x7 is not my intent. Sure 8 could by a power supply with a timer, but I already paid 150 bucks for this thing only to have to spend 10 bucks to do something that should be simple.new review: 3 stars and getting better...I went ahead and turned the device back on. This time I turned off the mic.  Mmm this change seems to make a huge difference with every motion detected. Now trees can blow or cars pass by my house and I do not receive an alert. This is a good thing. I only want \"real\" activity. So, I will post more when I give it the whole weekend. If I only get the \"real alerts\", than I will be much happier. As for the heat, it is still hot. As for a timer? I can only hope the maker can invent a way to do this. If I can turn the device off, shouldn't I be able to have an app that can have a timer setting?

I've never written a review on amazon, and I've purchased over $50,000 in tech stuff on Amazon. I can not be more dissatisfied with this camera.Two cameras in two weeks, first one the image looked purple. The second could not keep a connection. When I was away from home and tried to view from my smartphone, I was not able to. I tried everything, purchased new Apple Extreme router (which is one of the most solid routers out there), changed the wifi channels and tried all of them with no difference. Keep in mind the router is 8-10 feet away, with no obstruction in the way. All of my other wifi connected gear have had connection issues.Every tech company has \"tech support\" right? Not this one. Call their toll free number, it will \"ring\" no one will ever answer, I tried at all times of the day on different days. Now what about web, chat or email support? They sure must have that right? The answer is NO! Submitted a \"ticket\", but no one ever replied. That was 9 days ago! So my last resort, was Twitter. If they saw this on their page they will have no choice than to respond right? NOPE, their twitter messages are controlled and filtered, so my message never showed up on their twitter page. They only show whatever they want people to see.One more thing, they want you to believe and force you that storing your recorded video online they force you to pay a monthly fee for \"DVR\" cloud services. I understand that my video is safer online but give me a choice. And the main problem with this camera is the fact that you are forced to stream your video straight to their servers, so when their servers are down (which is constantly, you can check their twitter account) you cant access your camera.

Easy setup, plus DVR capability in the Cloud, what's not to like.  I purchased 3 of these and placed them in a 2nd home about 2 hours from my primary home.  They continually go offline and register as disconnected.  Dropcam tells you it is likely interference, but another camera a few feet away does not go offline.  Once it is disconnected, my only choice is to drive 2 hours each way to the 2nd home to unplug it, then plug it back in, which seems to resolve the problem for a few days.  The cameras are virtually useless in low light.  If you have a bright light situation where you can easily get to the camera to reset it, then it is probably OK.  Overall the Foscam IP cameras are 10 times more reliable for staying online, perform excellent in low light, but are also 10 times more difficult to set up.

For many people, that isn't an issue, but for those who are more security conscious, they should allow customers to access it directly (and if you're buying a surveillance camera, you are security conscious - you should protect your network as much as you protect the rest of your home).  Also, there is no reason why a third party should have access to your video feed.  I don't trust them to keep it private, no matter what they say.This is not an inexpensive camera, it should have the capability for local management, without using their service.

If I can suggest onething to drop cam it would be to do more SEO on your website to make it easier to find you. Once I did find it I was sold. The only thing I wasnt sure of is if we could stream publicly so I sent a support ticket and within an hour had an answer. It does allow for public streaming directly from my homes wireless connection.I think that little tibdit would be useful on their website for people looking like me. I couldnt find if public streaming was available but once they said yes I was sold. I got the cam a few days after ordering. It is in HD, it has night vision, it has two way communication and it is exactly what people want. an easy plug and play streaming cam with quality video.I got it home and connected it to my laptop to set it up. In about 30 seconds it discovered my network and it was done. I placed it in my workshop and now have fully HD public or provate stream of my aircraft construction.I would bet if the company spent more on google adwords advertising or did more organic seo to make it easier to find in a websearch everyone would own one of these.

I tried moving the camera to a different location, closer to my router, without success, until I moved it upstairs and mounted the camera high on the wall.

At first, I got a quick response from Dropcam support offering to give me a \"complimentary\" 3 free months of service, if I would just provide them with the serial number of my camera.

I think the dropcam is set on default to send notification per 15 to 20mins intervals. For example, if motion detection triggers a notification now, then the next notification would be sent after 15 to 20mins. I assume that dropcam did this on default to avoid clogging up their servers. You are able to choose whether to receive notification via iphone, ipad, ipod, or email. The motion detection is quite impressive since I set it up in my living room that covers the front door which is 2 windows away. The camera still able to catches the motion even through TWO WINDOWS.I would rate the resolution as close to HD but not quite. It suffers quality problem when in total darkness but it is still very good. Though, don't expect true HD quality like you get in a hdtv these days.How far can you place this from your wireless router you say? I have an apple airport express, and the drop cam must be placed within around 50ft in order to use it without dropped connections. Initially, I had so much dropped connections when I put the dropcam from the router with a bathroom and a bedroom between them.Overall, this is a good camera but there are certain limitations in how far you can place it from your router, and depending on the floor plan of your house, you may need to buy a wifi extender. I am raising the rating from 2 stars to 4 stars after about another week of testing.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------SLOW or NO notification after motion detectionThe notification system through your email or iPhone or iPad is hit or miss. This is where the 'dvr' service comes in handy. If your place is being robbed, don't expect a notification to come through the pipeline, but a recording would be on the cloud. Overall, I am still trying out the camera, but the lack of notification might be a deal breaker. I will update after I use this more.

In this day and age two weeks seems really slow! Shipping was free, so that was good.False motion alarms: I have my Dropcam in my basement and I'm getting many false motion alerts, especially on cloudy days and around dusk. Sometimes 5 in an hour! It appears that the alarms are triggered when the outside light dims and the camera temporarily goes into night vision mode then switches back. I have opened a support request and turned off the night vision feature for now.

I think this is a big negative if you want to use the camera for catching motion events. I'm still getting false motion events even when the night vision is off. A cloud goes by = motion alert!

I simply wanted to monitor my front yard and driveway and maybe use one as a baby monitor down the road when we have a kid.Setup was very simple as other reviewers have noted and I was up and streaming live video in just a few minutes...very cool.  The hardware is very simple and modern, dare I say even Apple-esque and seems to be of very high quality.  First impression of the video feed was, \"this is HD??; Even with a very fast broadband home connection the video was somewhat choppy and the resolution was far from what I would consider High Definition.  It is quite acceptable but just don't expect it to look anything like the 720p cable you watch on your HDTV.The \"Purple Haze\">>> Once I got my 2nd Dropcam setup and viewed the streams side by side I noticed one of the cameras video feed was very \"purple\" as colors were not true to life.  Green grass looked gray, Blue sky looked not so blue, green trees were just outright purple = This is what people that do acid must see lol...To demonstrate this (see user attached pictures), I set the cams up right next to each other looking at the same view from the same vantage point.  I then went upstairs to view the video streams on my dual monitor PC.  One cameras video is normal (left screen), the other has aforementioned \"purple haze\"(right screen)  This ain't cool...I have seen other complaints about this color issue and it seems Dropcam is aware of the issue.  I have a support ticket in as I write this and will update this review when it is resolved.  Hopefully it is just a firmware/software update and not a hardware flaw that necessitates a return.Other than the color issue the camera is great.  The Android app works well and connects 95% of time within ~10 seconds.  A couple times it failed to connect and you have to close the app and restart, no biggie.  Odd issue that has happen twice...when viewing the app on my Nexus 7 it shows a \"live feed\" of my driveway during the day BUT it is clearly night time outside and dark.  I press the \"go live\" button and its says \"you are live!\" haha.  A restart of the app fixes this and displays the correct live feed.The DVR function works as advertised and is very user friendly, I am not sure If I want to pay the $10/mo after the 14-day trial period is over though ($5 for additional camera so $15/mo in my case).  The cool thing is that if you are using this as a security camera the footage is stored offsite not locally, so if someone breaks into your abode and steals the camera itself, your video footage is still safe.If Dropcam fixes the color issue I'm keeping both!<<<Update 1/31/13>>>Dropcam customer service got back in touch with me and explained the \"purple haze\" is due to an infrared film over the lens that allows the camera to work better in nigh vision mode and hence, there is nothing they can do to correct it!  That did not explain why ONLY ONE OF MY 2 DROPCAMS exhibit this \"purple haze\" and the other is perfectly normal (again, see user attached pics to see what I mean).  They both equally well in night vision mode too.  They didn't respond to that part of my question and just left me hanging.

Previously, I had internal and external Axis network cameras throughout my properties.  What attracted me to DropCam was the simplicity of the provisioning process.  For example, unbox, create a user account, plug in the camera, find the Wi-Fi network of choice, unplug, and find the right location for the cameras placement.  I must admit the camera was just that easy to install and relocate.  I really like the camera's mounting stand and long plug tail to place the camera in almost any location.  However, one major difference with the DropCam camera compared to the Axis network camera use case is the DropCam camera is configured to send ALL activity to the cloud at ALL times.  While that does sound great for motion alerts, sound alerts, and DVR playback, but it comes at a network bandwidth cost.  I have residential DSL service at the highest possible speed (6.0 MB down, 768 Kbps up) and the DropCam camera's constant Wi-Fi and internet traffic slams my home network making all devices negatively impacted.  The only workaround I have developed on my own is to shut-off the alerts and the camera at all times when not actively viewing the camera.  This allows for full bandwidth and high speed for all devices when at home.  When I am away, I turn on the alerts and camera because bandwidth doesn't matter since I am not home.

Even if you are at home, on the same wifi network as the camera itself, the device will stream video to the dropcam server, and then your iphone will connect to the dropcam server to pull in the video stream.  The instructions say it will upload up to 600kb/sec, if that is available.  That will saturate many upload links.  There is also the issue that I do not want video from my baby room loaded on somebody else's server.  They do promise that it will be secure, but they are not a large company and I imagine it could be an enticing target for someone looking for videos to download.

I then downloaded the app on my iPad and it automatically detected the camera.  And lastly, I downloaded the app onto my ANDROID phone and it started working automatically. Now, if you want to RECORD video for, say, an entire week, you do have to pay a fee (of course), which was $9.99 a month or $99 for a year to be able to record a week's worth at a time.  Then you can go to the \"DVR\" and click on the day you want to view and the time and it plays it for you.  I have already tested it and it works very well. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is the picture is not as sharp as the Philips In.Sight security camera I have, but I must say it provides a wider view than the Philips, and there is a slight delay of about 6 seconds when viewing realtime.  Not that big a deal.  And it may just be my internet speed, although my Philips In.Sight camera's realtime is excellent.  But it's a trade-off.

This why I bought the device, however it has turned out to be a product from hell. Set up was pretty straight forward and actually easy. That is where my fun with the product ended. After set up. I noticed a terrible quality picture, especially because this was HD, and my iZon (half the resolution camera) had a 10 times better pictures. I tried EVERYTHING , that logically would affect the picture quality. After nothing helped and a half day trying, I tried calling customer no support. After several calls and sending several screen shots, (3 hours process), they tell me I have a defective units and replacement would be shipped (something about old units being shipped that were defective). Then they hang up without even getting where to ship it. I tied calling back but no answer, so I then call back the next day. After finally getting through and hours on the phone , they make me start all over again, answering 10's of questions, sending NEW picture files all over again, which , I do with out complaint, even though I explained this was done before with a hardware issue verdict. So after going back and forth for 4 days , guess what , yep they say it is a defective unit and they take my address for replacements. Three days go by and I get a email from Dropcam, asking me all the same questions again and wanting me to start the process all over again!!!!! I explain I already did this 2 times in full now, and want  someone to call me in a position of management, who knows what they are doing. It has been a week and I have heard NOTHING!

Hooked it up in a few minutes and fell in love with the whole concept, the way it works, and the app.  Was given another one for my birthday, and had to get more.  Now running SIX (one a Pro) and have the inside and outside of my house covered.  When we travel, it is great being able to keep an eye on your property.  I did have to upgrade my internet/wifi service because of the number of cameras, and the iSmart Alarm system I also run on my wifi, but that has benefited everyone in the house because of the insane number of other things everyone has hooked up to the wifi in the house.  The one problem I have run into is the night vision, the infrared reflects off the windows and pretty much makes the camera blind.  The night vision works great in my living room, kitchen and hallway.  I found that good motion lights outside make up for the lack of night vision on the outside views. With everyone in the house having access to the cameras and alarm system via their apple iToys I don't miss having a $35 a month alarm service that took 30 minutes sometimes to alert me the alarm had gone off.  I tried other cameras and systems and could never get them to function correctly if at all over the internet, and usually ended up recording in home, which always worried me if someone stole the laptop or the recorder in a burglary.  Off site recording for $99 a year?  Big whoop. Well worth it to me. I picked the two most likely cameras to catch a thief, to sign up for recording and the rest of them are real time and still send me notifications of movement and sounds.  Having tried most of the other stuff out there, I got no complaints about the system.Ps ~ one of my cameras developed the \"purple screen\" people mention.  I contacted dropcam and they sent out a replacement right away.  However, in my case it seemed to be self inflicted.  Because of the location of two of my cameras, in the window, I had to cut and modify the base and couldn't use the mounting plate they provided.  While waiting for the replacement camera, I was mounting another camera in another window.  I drilled a hole in the base to hold the base upside down from the top of the window sill.  In the process of putting in the screw, I touched the back of the camera with the magnetic bit holder I was using in my battery screwdriver.  The picture instantly turned pink (purple) on my iphone.  Both cameras eventually cleared the pink screen, and I went ahead and had drop cam just bill me for replacement camera to add it to my system.  It appears that the cameras are sensitive to a magnetic field.

They speak perfect english and are located here in the states.  The software and the setup are very STRAIGHT forward.  It's like an Apple product.  You open it up set it up and good to go, that's the way it should be.

My router from Verizon is setup in a downstairs office.  The baby room is directly above the office.  There are no microwaves or audio equipment in between and the camera steam is glitchy.  I went ahead and spent another $75 on a range extender but it still didn't help.  2 months into it, it's still NOT a reliable baby cam for me.  Knowing what I know now, I would have returned it.  If the camera it hooked up directly to camera via USB cable, the picture streams pretty nicely.  When used wirelessly, the technology is just not there yet.  The most reliable thing for me is the old fashioned \"audio baby monitors\"  at least I can get a consistent signal and know if the baby is awake and crying.  Of course I cannot see or here here remotely from work, but from work I can't do much either.  So in conclusion, I would recommend, but only if you are going to use in short proximity from router.

The web and mobile apps are nice (I tried both the iOS and Android versions). There is good parity across the different clients, though some features and settings are only accessible through the web app. From a usability perspective, it pretty much operates exactly as you would want a cloud-enable video camera to work. One feature I wish they would add is the ability to adjust the threshold at which motion events are triggered. I have my camera pointed outside and things like swaying trees cause notifications to be sent, often spamming my phone.The Dropcam has one huge weakness that may prevent it from being a viable solution for many people: it has abysmal wifi connectivity. I had an incredibly difficult time keeping the camera connected to the Internet, and after doing some research, it seems like many others have the same issue. I tried two different routers (Apple Airport Extreme and a D-Link) and observed the same issues. It also seems very prone to interference. Using wireless devices close by seems to cause the problems to worsen. On occasion, it even seems to prevent other devices from connecting to the internet.Switching to SD video quality from HD and turning off the microphone seems to help. In the end, I resorted to relocating my router to within 15 ft of the camera.

What a great program Prime is.In the box were the camera and mounting frame, USB cord, and adapter (similar to iPad power adapter).  Honestly, I plugged one end of the USB cord into the camera, the other end into my computer's USB port, and it automatically found my router.  It asked for the ID number of the router (which is printed on my router), it verified it, and I was up and running.  That took all of about 3 minutes.  It did NOT ask me for 801.3 numbers, or WPA, WEP, WAC, or any other scary settings.  Plugged it into the computer, it found my Wi-Fi automatically, asked for the ID number that's printed on my router, and I was set.I took the camera to where we had decided to set it up, and plugged it into a wall outlet.  The 10' cord was long enough, but I think that if an outlet was farther away, you could probably just use a household extension cord.I had turned my computer OFF, so I wasn't sure if it would work like that, but I thought I'd give it a try anyway.  I turned on my iPad, downloaded the free app, and accessed it.  There was a button to turn the camera ON.  Immediately, I had a beautiful live color picture of our living room.  This easy setup convinced me that all the other features of the camera would work as advertised, and they did.  You can \"rewind\" the video 5 minutes, and with the CVR function (an optional added monthly or yearly subscription, but they give you a free 2 week trial) you can view any activity from either 7 days or 30 days prior.PROS*******EASY setupExcellent picture qualityOutstanding very low light (or no light) picture (infrared LED system)Two way sound!Simple, intuitive controlsRemote access via computer, tablet, or phone (Android or Apple)!  A fantastic feature.Can be set (EASILY...really) to alert you via email whenever there is motion detected, and allows you to \"filter out\" alerts for known moving objects such as pets.  It learns to recognize your pet's size, color, speed, etc. so that you can set it, if you wish, to NOT send alerts for certain things.You can make and save clips, and share with others.  EASYExcellent Customer Service (I called them just to see how good their CS was)One of those products that turn out to be FUN to useProduct performance and features exceeded my expectationsCONS*******The circular camera (about the size of a hockey puck) snaps into the metal frame.  When I opened the box for the first time, the camera had \"snapped out\" of the frame and fell out.  No damage, but they should print a warning to that effect on the box.  That's about the only negative I can come up with.SUMMARY***********I would (and have) recommend this to friends and family.  We used it to monitor our dog while we were on vacation.  But it can be used as a security device (it is for indoor use only, but you can sit it on a window sill pointing outward and monitor your yard, driveway, etc....remotely!)  We were on vacation 1500 miles from home, but whenever we wanted to, we d just pull up the app on our phone, and boom, the live picture popped right up.  Now that we're back from vacation, we've set it up to monitor our back yard, so that whenever we're out, we can turn on the camera remotely, and it will alert us to motion.  We're getting another one for the front yard too.  The nice thing is that you can move the camera to different locations, and no additional setup is required.There are other monitoring cameras on the market, but none compare with the ease of setup of the Dropcam.  No need to enter IP addresses, security codes, etc.In a word, this product's design, operation, and performance is ELEGANT.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Makes me want to buy another.", "Author": "JC", "ReviewID": "R2JQFN9B24YKKQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Text alerts, low level light viewing and 100% dependable.

I realistically had the camera setup and working in about 20 minutes (no hurry ) , app for phone setup was flawless too.  I had my doubts because of some negative comments but I didn't experience any myself. I have some hard wired cams and quality is about equal to what I'm used to seeing.  It's a little pricy I suppose, but depends on what your personal definition of pricy is.Good concept. Wish they made an outdoor version, but looking a window works fine in the day. Night vision doesn't work well through glass because of the or glare off the glass or screen.Cons: Camera gets hot and the plastic mount is absolute cr@p. mount needs a totally new design to hold weight of camera when mounted on a wall.Had to make my own mount.

It has never worked right for recording, but it can take stills and save them to a network drive, which is usually fine.  Would prefer if it could record video like it was supposed to.Long story short, I decided to go a different route when I wanted a camera for home and wanted to try this product.It is easy to setup (if you can get Wifi working - I could not initially) and uses a standard USB cable for power, which makes it easy.To view the camera, I just go to the dropcam.com website and login and the camera is there.  I can configure it remotely through the dropcam website.Now my biggest complaint involves the fact that recording requires an additional monthly or annual fee.  The recording is great because I can look \"back in time\" to see what happened - if UPS came or if someone was at the door, etc.  But paying extra for this feature seems kind of silly when you're already shelling out $150 for the unit.The unit should be, like, $30, and then I would not complain about the fee.  Or offer a lifetime subscription for the unit when you purchase it.  I don't see us keeping this, honestly, because of the fee.My second biggest complaint is that it does not work through windows at night.  The night vision light reflects off of the window and you can't see diddly.

We have ours on the dresser of his nursery, and for a room that's about 8'x10', we get a clear shot of his crib, as well as about 60% of the rest of the room. Dropcam works great both during day and night, the night vision is particularly useful since we can monitor our baby without having to turn on the lights. Using Dropcam made sleep training our son tremendously easier, and has given us a peace of mind we never expected. At night, we'll even leave one of our cell phones on just to have the live feed running, the mic is sensitive enough to pick up the slightest whimper.Dropcam comes with the camera, an adjustable stand, a USB cable and an AC adapter. While Dropcam markets setup in under 60 seconds, it did take several tries to get the WiFi up and running, so be prepared for a little frustration. Once on your WiFi network, it's portability shines--you simply unplug the camera, move it to any room you want, plug it in, and it just works. With the camera in one hand, and a smartphone running the app in the other, it's easy to set up a satisfactory shot.The DVR functionality is great--we've subscribed to the 7-day feed. The DVR feature is accessible through a web browser or mobile app, and consists of a slider with markers for when it detects motion (web), or a list of activities for when it detects motion (mobile app). Either method provides a slick interface with a simple learning curve. And while we're not exactly thrilled about paying a monthly fee, it's handy to see when our baby wakes, and when we go in to check up on him. This feature makes it a great device for other features. You can set it up in your living room to watch your home while you're away, set it up to watch your pets, or to keep an eye on your driveway.A couple of minor gripes, there is a slight lag from anywhere to 2-5 seconds from when action takes place and when you see it on your PC or mobile app. And, of course, there's the somewhat steep price and afore mentioned monthly fee. But for a slick device that's easy to use once it's up and running and provides an elegant solution to peace of mind, Dropcam is an incredible purchase that I whole-heartedly recommend.", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great!", "Author": "Marjorie", "ReviewID": "R1N7I4HI7SVAN8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great camera.

The image quality is marginally better than my EasyN and the sound quality of the mic sounds perfect for this sort of an application.I originally bought the camera to use with my Blue Iris surveillance software but quickly realized this wasn't going to be an option since the Dropcam video feed is proprietary and they requires you to set up an account with them and that you purchase a plan that allows 7 day recording for $9.95/month or $99/year or 30 day recording for $29.95/month or $299/year.  That actually doesn't sound like a bad deal if you factor cloud storage for 30 days of video into it.  Still I'd have been happier if I could have used the feed in Blue Iris for my needs.  If you haven't tried Blue Iris for your surveillance camera needs I would highly recommend it.  It's so robust and has so many features for so many cameras and the price is really affordable.

Once the registration process is complete...which doesn't take long at all, you detach it from the computer, plug it in an electrical outlet, turn  it on and wham! You are up and running! The picture clarity is most excellent, and the view is plenty wide to capture most of the area anyone would be interested in getting video of. We were also impressed by the clarity in the sound abilities of the Dropcam, and was pleased to see there was an adjustment in mic sensitivity. What we  didn't see much of,  in the many other write-ups, were comments concerning the notifications available to either android or iphone's. We were very interested in the Dropcams alerting us to activity in the area we were monitoring, and found that the system is very responsive in alerting to any sound and/or video...within seconds... if you have a clear signal to your phone! THIS WAS VERY IMPORTANT to us! The audio portion does have to be tweaked to get it to just the right sensitivity, so as not to alert every time someone just walks near the door!This system is WELL WORTH the rather small investment for the camera.

I had tried another that was in the $90 range and had to return it due to poor reception. I have been very hesitant to try another. Set up really is super simple. I accidentally found myself on their old activation site and it asks for an activation code which is no longer required.  I just signed off and back on, got to the correct place and the camera communicates its unique number automatically.  You just need to enter a name for your camera and your wi-fi password and that is it.  Unplug from your computer and plug into a regular outlet with the supplied USB adapter.  The 10ft cord was plenty for my application. I have mine looking through double pane windows in the front of my house and get a very good picture.  I get motion alerts from activity in the street.  I want these alerts, I am at the end of the street so have very little traffic.  I am really impressed with the sound quality in the room where the camera is installed.  The sound on the monitoring end is good but does have a little bit of a back ground noise with it.  I talked to my dog when I was close to home and it made him go crazy looking for me.  There is a tiny delay in what you see and what is live but only a split second.  I have read other reviews to turn off the infared to see out windows at night but am not sure how to do that with this camera (seems to be a newer version than their original).  It will double as a baby monitor when my grandson is over, it is so simple to move around and aim, it is no trouble at all.  If the camera is unplugged, you simply plug it back in and it automatically reconnects to your wi-fi. The actual camera is the round black part and easily pops in and out of the grey holder if you want to place it in something different.  It does say to allow good ventilation, the camera can get hot.  It comes with a disk to mount the grey holder on the wall, again, it pops in and out easily from the wall mount holder so it does not have to be a permanent placement.  I plan to install the wall mount to keep it out of my grandson's reach when he is over and set it back in my window when using it for surveillance.  To view the camera on computer you simply sign onto the website and you can make the picture full screen.  I have downloaded the app for my iPhone and iPad mini and you just open the app and have your picture.  The iPad shows spaces for 4 cameras and you just touch on the one you want to make full screen.  The camera comes with a two week free recording period which you can activate without a credit card.  Monitoring is very reasonable at $9.99 a month if paid monthly for saving 7 days of recorded material.  There is also an option to save 30 days of recorded material.  The nice thing is no DVR is required, Dropcam stores everything in the cloud on their encrypted servers. Each additional camera is discounted at 50% for recording services but recording is not required and live viewing is always free.  It is very easy to navigate the recordings and view motion detected events. You can even scan through the recorded material because it shows a picture of what is recorded during the time you are mousing over.

I've never used a different type of wi-fi camera before, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but so far I'm pretty happy with it.  There is one thing you should know about the night viewing function though.  If you are mounting the camera to look out of a window, the window will reflect the infrared lights that surround the lens back into the camera, making it impossible to see anything in the dark unless it comes right up to the camera.  You will still see car headlights and anything that comes within a few feet of the camera, but if you want it for night vision, try to mount it where the infrared lights won't shine right back into the camera.  I had to contact technical support because I had issues starting a subscription to their DVR service, and they responded promptly and were very helpful.

From the corner of a room, you can see all four walls and everything that is in the room - no room to hide.The software that enhances low-light situations (before the infra-red mode kicks in, automatically, for total darkness) is truly amazing.  (Samsung has similar low-light software included in its latest smartphone.  The software sets the new standard for cameras.)The mic on the camera is pretty good too.  I have turned down the mic's sensitivity to one third but I can still hear myself typing on the keyboard 15 feet away from the camera.The Dropcam delay is about 2 or 3 seconds.  The next best thing for baby monitoring is sitting next to the baby.With all this goodness, don't overdo things: Don't try to control the camera from two computers at the same time, the Dropcam software gets pretty confused.  When prompted in  the set-up phase, don't try to economize on buffer space, give it at least 20 or 50 MB.  Don't use Dropcam in places with marginal wifi strength.  And where wifi is average, don't use HD (although the sharpness of HD is a pleasure to look at).Without HD, you also cut back on the number of bytes flowing over the internet - you can lower the 60GB per month quoted elsewhere down to 25GB and still have the camera on all the time.Turning the camera remotely OFF and ON takes a few minutes to settle, and you may have to press Refresh (F5) if the \"wheel\" on the screen keeps spinning much longer - better, leave the camera ON all the time if you can.  (Mine has now been going for a week without a single problem, have not touched the camera one time.  Any intermittent wifi hick-up between camera and router is resolved automatically, in seconds.)Finally, at least in my situation there is no need for the DVR service so the subscription part of Dropcam can be dropped, no monthly fees.I am hard to please but Dropcam gets five stars!PS:  I also looked into the Foscam alternative.

If I had anything that needed improving, it would be the camera base.....it is functional, but it could be better.  Don't get me wrong, if definitely does the job....I just think it could do a better job.  Because the wire hangs down below the camera, it makes it somewhat awkward to position the camera (wants to twist in the mount slightly).  It has a good wall mount that works well....but the wire has to come off the side instead of straight down.  If there was a slot for the wire to go straight up then it would be perfect.  I would like to see a similar suction cup mount for the base in order to mount it on a window facing outside.

If you are willing to subscribe to the DVR option - this camera will probably be a 5-star success for you.  However, I will (respectfully) rate & review the Dropcam according to the way that it met and missed my requirements.I needed a camera that 1) Images in high resolution, 2) detects motion - 3) takes a brief video - 4) e-mials one (or more) of the video frames at FULL Resolution to my e-mail account and 5) does NOT require a \"subscription service\". The application is front door monitoring - with the ability to readily recognize the face of the visitor (or intruder). Here is how the Dropcam meets these requirements:1) While the digital array is generous (720 x  1280 pix, 30 fps) its effect is minimized by the very-broad 107\u00ba optical angle. (# of pixels devoted to a face sized area is minimal with the camera mounted <6' away)2) The e-mail alert works well, but the attached video image is a very low resolution reduction from an original and insufficient for facial recognition.3) Retrieving full resolution requires a subscription.4) The motion detection somewhat precedes video imaging. The image supplied in the e-mail alert occasionally shows a scene with NO human content.5) The motion detection is impractically sensitive, alerting with light changes or very slight foliage motion.6) Transmitting MB of video data all-day (and night) long when only video following a motion detection is required is inefficient use of bandwidth for my application.Positives:setup is dead simple - no tech savviness requiredthe camera is small and elegantly designedthe resolution is impressive (though the effect is somewhat sacrificed due to the wide angle optics)the e-mail alert is very fastthe Android app worked very well to control and monitor the video & audioIn the end I returned the camera (thanks Amazon!) because it did not meet my requirements.

After 3 days of experimenting, I determined that the Dropcam needs to be placed so that it is line of site to the router.  I have 2.4 MHz cordless phones and my wireless devices can \"see\" many neighboring Wifi routers.  The successfully placed drop cam is about 20 feet from the D-Link DIR-655 router.  The other consideration is having to pay to \"remember\" the recorded events.  On the other hand, once you pay, you can review event histories, capture these histories and download them to your PC as MP4's or JPG's.  Motion detection works great as does the \"night vision\".  The Hi Definition pictures are good, but facial feature distinction could be better.  The PTZ is not really PTZ but rather a way to zoom in on a portion of the field of view.  Another plus is if someone breaks in to your house and steals the Dropcam, it's too late.  You've already captured their image and it is on a California server at Dropcam Inc.  No way can the thief destroy the recording.  The PC, iPhone App and iPad Apps are all different presentations.  The iPad App shows live motion of more than one Dropcam at a time.

Especially impressive is that I receive notifications and can view video on my cell phone (Galaxy Note II), my Nexus 7 tablet or my PC - anytime / anyplace.  I have this installed in a vacation house in Mexico and pick up the video feed nicely from a US location - there is no blocking of URLs from out of the country.  I can even talk to an intruder and warn him off with the two way voice - right from my phone.  Everything performs as advertised.  A couple relatively minor things I would like to see improved are:  add dual-band WiFi for better wireless range - I had to move my WiFi router into the same room with the Dropcam to be sure it had a strong enough connection to stay reliably on; a little better mechanical mount - it could be tighter.  I will also note that running continuous video generates a lot of data to sift through if you have a problem.  I do get quite a few false alarms from occasional noise outside the house, but probably better that than not.

First I must say that after decades of experience with computers and electronics, I DO believe this item may work flawlessly in some situations. Other reviews are a testament to that fact.But it is NOT plug-and-play in all situations and certainly was not in mine. I have fast fiber optic Internet with a very recent top of the line Linksys router. I bought the unit two weeks before leaving on a vacation with the intention of having it remotely monitor a particular room in the house. I first set up the camera within visual distance of the router to make sure it worked. There were occasional problems with it spontaneously disconnecting from my network. These were always fixable by a reset using the button on the back. I also noticed that even when the camera was functional, Live View often showed a loading icon rather that the current scene.After a few weeks of tweaking, trying things like static IP's, etc. I finally set up the camera in the target area. The room has a strong and consistent wireless signal and can easily handle fast upload and downloads without problems. The camera seemed to be working for 24-48 hours, but again disconnected itself from the network. This time I tried just a simple power cycling and it came back on-line.I subscribed to the Dropcam web service and left on a vacation of over two weeks. I was able to use both a PC and iPad app to monitor the camera, although the same annoying \"loading\" icon appeared on Live View. After about two days, the camera disconnected itself. Obviously since I was gone there was no other network traffic originating from my home and also no way to do a power cycle or hard reset.I think the camera has good build quality, but must have some design flaws in either firmware, software or both that prevent it from delivering on the most important feature for a system of this type: RELIABILITY. I really have no idea why it cannot maintain constant wireless communication in an area that easily supports other devices. Although as another reviewer mentioned, it really requires lots of bandwidth. I would have much preferred a system that could record to my own home server, which is hardwired to my network.

It is really easy to use and it does a good job except one crucial (well crucial for me at least) thing which is that it does not have motion based recording. The motion detection they are talking about in the description is that it shows you where there was motion on the recording. This way you can go back and check out what was happening where there was motion very easily.But it keeps recording and using your bandwidth, even when there is no motion, 24/7 as long as it is turned on.

I tried again on a Windows based machine and same result. I called and left emails to Dropcam Technical Support and and they shipped a second unit to me and and afterwards sent me a shipping label for return of the original system (the replacement Dropcam quickly received before shipping defective unit back to them). This was my discouraging experience with the system and a one star deduction however the customer service was extremely good. Now for the positive experience.The second Dropcam was received and I hooked it up to my Macbook Air and within a minute it found my airport express router and I entered my security code and then unplugged from my computer and attached to the 120 volt outlet with adapter. I then logged on to the Dropcam cloud service and the video and audio was working perfectly. I was pleasantly surprised since there have been so many problems reported with wireless monitoring systems (including other manufacturers) with the airport express wireless routers however this one worked fine without a need for any of the complicated looking workarounds I have seen on the web for this router. I am using Mountain Lion 10.8.2 with the latest software update on my airport express. I downloaded the dropcam software for my iPhone 4 and audio and video worked perfectly with the standard 3g network. During the first day of use I noticed several dropouts where the camera lost the signal. I used the suggested method of changing my channel on my 2.4 ghz router from channel 10 to channel 1 and for the past 3 days this has no longer been a problem and camera has been working great. The wide angle lens is a great feature for my purposes on this camera since I have a shallow field for view needed and can get more subject matter in the screen. The quality is outstanding however keep in mind as with any wide angle lens those items far away may be harder to identify. For my situation the best part of this system (other than not needing your computer on or additional hardware) is the cloud monitoring software. I can quickly watch from work on my iPhone or away on trips the live video and for the $99 a year have the 7 day recording with activities identified and easily reviewed. I know many reviewers have been disappointed with the service fee however I believe the value after experiencing the system features for me is worth the upgrade. I highly recommend this product however had to deduct one star for my original DOA first unit.

I am currently using it as a baby monitor with the Dropcam iPhone app. You have to create an account through Dropcam.com(creating the account itself is free) and log-in with a user name and password if you want to see the video from either an iPhone or computer. (I know it has Android compatibility too but I haven't seen the app for the Android so I can't comment.) They do let you try out the DVR service for the first week but then you have to pay a monthly fee for this service or you can just watch the video live. I have noticed a slight delay on my Dropcam but I'm not sure if that is the case for all Dropcam users. I would say it's between 5 & 10 seconds, hardly noticeable at all. You can talk through the app into the camera (by pressing the \"talk\" button) and you can hear audio which seems pretty clear. I haven't noticed any lag on the video. You can login from any computer with internet access to watch the Dropcam. If you set the preferences the App will alert you on your iPhone every time there is movement.  The Dropcam is highly durable, I know this because I have unfortunately dropped it on the hardwood floor and it still works very well with no cracks or anything. Also you can remove the dropcam from it's base, it is probably not much bigger than a golf ball and not too difficult to hide if you are a creative person.

Plugged it into my computer, joined it to the wireless network.  That's it.  The camera's wireless radio seems to work well in my house.  Currently using it on my porch as a security camera.  The infrared feature works very well - lights up my entire porch and parts of the carport.  I opted for the 7-day DVR package and have been very pleased by the function of the service.  The sensitivity of the motion sensor seems about right.  I'm constantly amazed at how fast I receive notifications.  If I walk out on the porch my cell phone chimes with a notification within 3 seconds.

Both are plenty good for monitoring your house while you're away or keeping an eye on a business such as a shop or office or reception area.

The audio is good for most situations but can become distorted in some large rooms that don't have good acoustics.We have tried just about every feature including the talk back function.

We don't have a full-blown security system because we're home pretty much all the time.  All of the possessions that were not locked safely away are located in the living room (HDTV, router, DVR, USB hard drives, etc.), so I bought the Dropcam because it has HD picture quality, night vision, wireless communication to router for remote access, and DVR capability at the company's servers.  I set it up on the mantel, peeping through some garland there, ran the power line across the top of the mantel and down the other side to an outlet, and pointed the camera directly at the end of the room where the equipment is located.  We wouldn't necessarily prevent a burglary, but we would have a very clear picture of the burglars (at least until they unplugged the router).  I was very happy with the result.  I could check on the status of the house any time I wanted (even receiving event notifications on my smartphone when the mailman walked past the front picture window).  Of course, a major feature is that you need not have a PC in your home and booted all the time to monitor the camera.  We signed up for the 30-day DVR plan, and dropped it upon returning from vacation.  There is also a 7-day DVR plan, but we are always here, so we're not using (or paying for) any DVR capability now.  We didn't use the 2-way audio capability, but it would have come in handy if I had checked on the status while burglars were in the house.  I'm very, very happy with the unit.  There are many potential uses for it, depending on the layout of your home or office.  It has been working fine for 3 months now with no problems at all.

I have been using two iPhones to monitor my baby boy from time to time, but that doesn't work when it's dark. So when I saw this camera on Uncrate I thought I found the solution.But alas, the picture quality is terrible. In a day lit room, I set it up about 5 feet away from my boy swinging in a baby swing. Even with plenty of light, I was not able to make out details like his hands, or the toys hanging on the bar in front of him, on the iPhone screen monitoring.The other problem is the delay ... I understand the camera is shipping the audio/video up to the \"cloud\" and then back to the iPhone app or whatever. That makes for a good 1 to 1.5 second delay at best. I can hear him in the other room make a noise and it's that long of a delay or more, before I hear it on the iPhone.It's too bad, it's a nice design. But I guess I'm going to go back to something I know works better like a Vivotek or similar (which I have outside on my front porch, works awesome.)

I contacted CS and they replied within the hour. After troubleshooting several things, providing them with some data, one of the things they wanted to know was any other devices in the area. As it turns out, I have a Bose surround sound speaker system hooked up to my entertainment system. There's a large subwoofer that sits on the floor just a few feet away from the unit. I moved the unit to the kitchen and the problems ceased. So, I moved it back to the living room but put it on top of the entertainment center instead and so far- no issues.Even though I have Internet Extreme package (up to 50 Mbps) and a very good setup around the house, I have had some wi-fi dropping. To alleviate that issue, I went ahead and ordered a Apple Airport Express to extend my network. I'm not sure if that's the issue or if there's unknown interference. Either way, even with the drops, it's never been off long enough to notify me via email/text (every 30 minutes). Usually, it's just a few minutes and comes back on.Hardware is legit, video is great and the bandwidth consumption is minimal.I have read a lot of complaints about customer service. However, I wanted to let other know, my experience has been stellar.Thank you for a great product, professional and timely response from customer service.

Seemed like I was unboxing an Apple product.Setup - This was a breeze. Super easy and fast, as advertised.Build - Simple and sturdy. Feels very high-quality.Web Interface - Easy to navigate. Very user-friendly. Easy access to settings. Well-polished.Video Quality - Here's where I have to ding Dropcam. Quality is quite Impressive when viewed through a browser, but quite undesirable when viewed via the Android app. There's no point in making an HD camera if you aren't able to view the stream in HD. The pixelation is such that you can't even make out a person's facial features. I have found a workaround by logging into my camera via my tablet's browser (as I type this, this method is not currently working, so don't rely on it), but this shouldn't have to happen. I'll also point out that you need Flash to view the stream, so if you're on an iPad (I'm using the Asus Transformer Prime), you're out of luck. My guess is that the quality of the video via the iPad app is decent, and all focus was put into making that app, while Android got 2nd fiddle (as usual). One more thing I'd like to point out about the Android app is that there are no options to talk or zoom like the website offers. Don't know if these features are available on the iPad app or not.In conclusion, I'd probably be inclined to give Dropcam 5 stars if it weren't for the poor quality of video and lack of features in regards to the Android app. I don't know about other Dropcam users, but I rarely use a laptop or desktop computer as I always have either my tablet and/or phone with me, which is how I'll be viewing my Dropcam footage.
