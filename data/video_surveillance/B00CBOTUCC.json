You can't hear anything unless you are 2 or 3 inches from the speaker and that is not understandable.  I'm keeping it because when the doorbell rings I am able to see the person outside before opening the front door.", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Battery life short & difficult to recharge", "Author": "Richard Cunningham", "ReviewID": "R1RCRB52TYCP53", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera and display work well enough but the battery in the camera only lasts about 5 days before completely discharging.  After you have the camera mounted, it is difficult to remove it from the bracket it mounts in.  It has to be removed from the mount to recharge the battery as the plug-in charger plugs into the back of the camera.  They should have made it so you could plug in the charger without removing it from the mounting bracket.", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "does not work properly", "Author": "John T Stevenson", "ReviewID": "RM7D8W3OH5JZK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "can not pair the camera with the receiving units for more than a few minutes. also, camera battery only lasts 2 days on standby, not two weeks or months.
