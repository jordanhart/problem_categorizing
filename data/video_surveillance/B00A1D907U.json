{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Solid DIY system - EXCELLENT support", "Author": "Pen Nom", "ReviewID": "R32UY80HRZQQ8R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fortress S02-BThis system is packaged with care and is pre-programmed.  If you know nothing about electronics or security systems, but can read a manual (or three),you can have this system installed and tested in an afternoon.The most tools you will need are a drill (to sink \"mollies\" for mounting motion sensors and/or control unit)and a screwdriver. Since there are several reviews that go into detail on installation or talk about ease of installation, I will just give you a few random comments that may help you along the way.Pre-1 - The most important thing you can do is think through what you are trying to accomplish with your system layout.  I first thought about where to place devices to keep anyone from entering the house without an alarm. This is essentially your window/door sensor placement.  If you are going to protect every entrance, you are going to have to buy enough sensors for EVERY separate window and door, including FOUR for a two-window set if it raises from the bottom and lowers from the top. It includes bathroom windows and that 12\" square window in the basement. Lots of sensors (and consider broken glass sensors).Secondly, I assumed that somehow someone breached the outside sensors.  Once inside, I placed motion detectors in those rooms an intruder would have to traverse to get to another section of the house.  They are placed so that any window/door breached should be detected by motion no later than the next room entered.  So far all of this is for an empty house.Thirdly, I assumed the intruders were able to get past the motion detectors.  If no one is in the house, you just have to congratulate them on a job well done and hope they trip a sensor while moving around or getting out.  If people are inside, you must have a plan as if you had not installed any devices at all.  Dogs and guns for the \"poor\" like me, separate system sensors and safe rooms for others.The best security system in the world is useless if your plan is bad.1-There are multiple security items you may have in your kit.  The one I installed had the control unit (which is probably called something else<G>), panic button, key fobs, door/window sensors, motion detectors, indoor siren, and outdoor siren.  It is wise to test them several times  (antenna out, antenna in, near other wireless sources, etc.)  For that reason, I would suggest placing the items in the approximate place you plan to mount them, such as a window sill, and do all testing before mounting them.For example, by placing the window/door sensors on the window sill near where you plan to mount them, you can test the alarm function and make any needed adjustment before drilling holes or mounting adhesive.2-I know this is simplistic, but it is important.  A major reason for testing window/door sensors before mounting is to gauge the sensitivity of the two devices which work together. Since their proximity is a major determinant of how sensitive they are to disturbance, you should make sure you mount them at the correct distance.  The manuals say they should be mounted 1/2\" or less apart.  The closer they are mounted, the more \"opening\" or shaking required to set them off and the less likely they are to give a false alarm.  If they are mounted further apart, they are very sensitive (a window shake may separate them enough to alarm)and more likely to give a false alarm.3-As a part of the mounting process for any device that has an antenna, plan your mount with the antenna extended.  You may not have to extend the antenna to have a strong signal, but if you do not plan for it, you may have to re-mount in order to use the antenna.4-For the sake of your hearing, save the siren tests until last.  You can tell if any sensor/alarm is working by looking at the readout on the control unit.  Once all sensor units are working correctly, you can test the sirens from outside by using the key fobs to arm and disarm the alarm.5-The components are all white and fairly large since they have a battery and electronics.  If you have wood/color in the areas where you are installing the devices, using contact paper or non-permanent markers make them almost unnoticeable (to the male/husband eye<G>).  The only thing to watch is not covering the sensors or status lights, and they are clearly defined.6-You cannot successfully understand and install the system without three documents.  Inside the box are a one page \"Quick Start\" manual and an OEM manual, probably translated from Chinese for technicians.  The third document is a pdf in the Manuals section of the Fortress website.Location is  http://www.fortresssecuritystore.com/skin/frontend/base/default/images/S02%20system%20Manual.pdf7-The advice to put the control unit in the \"middle\" of your sensors is good, conservative advice.  In our case, a 2700 sq. ft. house with sensors in EVERY corner worked fine without even having the antenna extended. Moving it to the MBR in one corner of the house worked just as well.  I am not sure if this is common or not.  The frequencies used for communication are 315MHz and 433MHz, which generally allow more distance than devices in the GHz range.8-If you have an answering machine or other device that picks up your telephone line, you cannot arm/disarm the security system by calling in.  The ability to call in and listen to your environment through the control unit is lost in this case, but if there is an alarm and you have programmed the system to call you, you can THEN listen in.  And that is when you need it most.  If you have a fax machine that \"answers\" the phone and then passes the signal on if it is a voice call, all features will probably work fine9-I will not tell you the specific 3-4 times I misunderstood the docs and had to redo/recover.  Just make sure you read them fairly well before you start - all three of them. There are just enough \"oddities\" that you may miss something.  If you are the sort of person who does not read manuals, you will still make it work - just a little later.We have only used the system for a few days, but it has worked great in every test.  I hope we never get to REALLY use it.", "Date": "June 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazingly easy to set up and reliable! Read if you dont have Home Phone!", "Author": "S. Eckelberry", "ReviewID": "R7SRTKBV6BDLM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "EDIT 1/31/2014 - As user RP has commented below, the OBi will no longer support Google Voice after May of this year. I still love the OBi device and will look into changing to another service (they say these will only cost a couple of dollars per month with one-time fees available) when the time comes and will update this post with the best solution. For more information, look here: [...]------ORIGINAL REVIEW------Let me preface this by saying that I was suspicious of the 30+ solid 5 star reviews. Surely SOMEONE found something to nitpick, right? Anyway, I originally thought I was going to be the one to reduce the average but I'm pleased to say that, for the price, this is easily a 5 star product.In general, there is one major downside to installing your own security system: if someone breaks in, chances are that you are only going to know when you return home. The most competitive feature of these Fortress systems is the ability to call preprogrammed numbers when an alarm is triggered at home. In fact, for this reason, we did not even plug in the siren - when we are on campus, we could easily be home in minutes if there was an alarm.The whole system took about 45 minutes to set up, including the amount of time I spent developing a plan for where to put the various sensors. It's a good idea to put the motion sensors in areas of your home where an intruder is unlikely to avoid. That said, the sensors are already programmed to the base station, so it's really a turn-on-and-go type of deal.Originally I was upset that the auto-dialer would require a home phone line to operate, but I've found a no-monthly-fee solution. This OBi100 VoIP Telephone Adapter and Voice Service Bridge will let you use Google Voice (a free service) to route your alarm system over the internet. We don't even use the OBi to call out or anything - this forty dollar adapter is just for the alarm system. And with no monthly fee, I can be assured that even when we aren't home we always know the house is secure.Lastly, the key fobs are nice because training my roommate to arm and disarm the alarm from the keypad every time would probably not work. The alarm is \"tested\" every once in a while because we will forget to disarm it and within seconds of opening the door our cell phones will start ringing.I'm looking at upgrading the system at a later date for a couple more motion sensors, but all is well so far!UPDATE 12/5/2013 - I have recently completed the security system install for the house, and I still love this product. If you need more motion sensors or door alarms, I recommend checking out e bay, as you can buy inexpensive (like ten dollar) motion sensors that will easily pair with this system. The only downside is that they are shipped from overseas, so it might take a few weeks to get them. Pretty much any 433mhz security products will work with the FORTRESS system, so simply run a search for \"433mhz [window sensor OR motion detector]\" and various local or overseas sellers will appear.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredible customer service | Easy to install and effective security system", "Author": "EarthlyPawn", "ReviewID": "R18IZ8YYAECWSQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just recently we had 2 separate break-ins in our neighborhood, and even though we had never had problems here before we decided it was time to do something to help stave off the potential of falling victim to these guys. We didn't want to get locked into a long contract that would have us paying $30-50 per month to a security monitoring company, so I looked into how I could set one up myself.After searching high and low through every local store in our area it became very clear that the only way I was going to do this was to buy something online and pray it would work since it's such a pain to buy something online only to find out that what you bought is no good and you may or may not ever see your money again if you try and ship it back. After reading all the reviews regarding various wireless security systems and seeing that this company had rave reviews (which at first I suspected could only be written by the company itself), I finally took a chance and purchased the Fortress S02 A security system after calling them to see if they could deliver it in time before we were suppose to go on vacation. I spoke to the owner Michael this past Friday and I received the system yesterday which was Monday. When he heard my concern about how long it would take to get here he went above and beyond what his delivery schedule states of 2-3 business days and had it rush shipped from Washington state to North Carolina.When it came to installation I couldn't believe how simple it was to install, and yet how effective it was when I tested it. All the windows/doors sensors and motion sensors came preprogrammed so all I had to do was put them where I wanted them and program the phone numbers I wanted it to contact into the base unit and I was done in less than 1 hour. The instruction manual was incredibly simple to understand so everything went like a charm. When testing it I couldn't believe how loud the alarm was so I have no doubt that not only will all my neighbors hear it if somebody tries to break in, but the thieves will most likely retreat as quickly as possible when they realize that they are not as stealth as they thought.", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "WATCH the installation & operation videos. Very Good.", "Author": "Greg Goodman", "ReviewID": "R3VLASBM9II8OI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With alot of choices out there, it requires major homework as to what works best for you. Having a wired/monitored system installed by a pro is still probably the preferred system, but most require a contract with a small install charge ( $99 ) & monthly fees of $30-$50 depending on what's being monitored, ( smoke/fire etc.) More & more systems being sold to the DIY's are the wireless variety. Once you install the system, programming & operating are fairly strait forward. I basically chose the Fortress SO2 system, mainly because I have an Amazon acct. & the system seemed to have good reviews. ( which we all know can be slanted ) You have have to feel out each review & decipher the wording/phrasing etc. & decide for yourself if the review is authentic. Which is what i did & felt pretty comfortable. Also, at $130.00, it's three times cheaper than some iphones. Anyway, I bought it & got it & started to map out where each sensor would go & start the programming (which is not much as the sensnsors come pre-programmed by number. Here's where I stumbled a little. I think that the manual had some verbage that did not jive with the panel, so I cussed just a little & finally called the Support number. I'm sure you've read of  \"Mike\" the ownner. He personally answers most calls & knows the answer before you ask the question. I'm fairly competent, but I got stumped again on a couple progamming issues. Boom....called Mike & he walked me through some zone issues. Again........WATCH THE VIDEOS. Even prior to purchasing. They are very good. I had to watch a few over & over, & soon it all comes together. Knowing what I know now. I could install & program the system ( I have 8 window/door sensors & 2 motion detectors ) in an hour. It's a little complex at first, but work through it & nothing else can touch this system. A couple issues: 1} I have had one motion detector have three random trips. Mike suggested swapping it out , which I will. 2) When alarm is tripped, you cannot dial out on land line ( 911 etc. ) because the system is dialing out to stored number. Suggest call 911 on cell, ( I do not have mine programmed to dial out to police ) 3) I recently discovered that when my system trips (testing etc. ) it opens my neighbors garage door.

Since we get up at night to get a drink or go to the bathroom, it doesn't set it off and we rely on the door/window sensors that work 100% of the time. The away mode makes it impossible for a burglar to rob you without setting off the alarm. For us, just having the loud siren go off should deter, 99% of thieves without having to place calls to a security company.

If I had it to do over, I'd do some additional shopping around before jumping on this.  Other retailers market this same kit with better written instructions. Who wants to be compelled to call the retailers cellphone for instructions?  To his credit, the retailer does work hard to support the product after the sale.

It was starting to give false alarms so twas time to replace.This system is a very nice system, already programmed and easy to install and set up. The alarm/horn is VERY loud. So, as the instructions say, do NOT put this near where you sleep or normally sit (such as the living room). It truly is LOUD! It's easy to hear the arm signal when you \"arm\" it from the outside. My older system was sometimes difficult to hear from outside after locking the door and arming it.One thing my old system had that this one doesn't, that I became used to, is a chime whenever the doors were opened and closed. There is no signal at all to let you know if someone has opened one of the protected doors. Convenient if you're at home and do not arm the system while inside.One thing I'm disappointed in is that the instructions say that it will not work with any phone line other than a land-line. I wonder, however, if it will work with the new wireless home phone systems that Verizon Wireless and AT&T; are selling ($20 per month unlimited calling) that your normal phone plugs into (corded or cordless). They give a dial-tone, which is what kept home alarm systems (and satellite boxes) from working with cell phones as they do NOT give a dial-tone. The device, such as an alarm system or satellite box, needs to detect dial-tone before it would attempt to dial out). These new land-line replacement systems do give dial-tone when you go off-hook with your \"normal\" phone that you plug into the wireless box.

There wasn't much info on doing this, so I will pass on what I learned. If you don't know much about electricity you may not want to try this.My wife was against a wireless system because she didn't want the wireless sensors hanging on our doors. Sensors on windows can be hidden by curtains, but they were just too noticeable on our doors. We had already ditched our worthless alarm monitoring company, and still had the system in place with nicely-hidden wired sensors already on the doors.I originally bought the $199 S02-B system from Amazon, but it arrived used. The sensors had obviously been taped in place somewhere, then removed. Many of the batteries were dead and the manual was underlined and scribbled on everywhere. I figure someone paid for a used system and got my brand-new system from Amazon by mistake. I returned the S02-B, and bought the smaller S02-A from Amazon.Mike from Fortress was really helpful. He apologized for the used system, even though it was Amazon's fault. He also provided useful info on hooking up  to the wired sensors. The installation manual from Fortress was helpful, as was a manual I downloaded from the PiSector website--they are essentially the same system.I took the old alarm system board out of our utility/electronics cabinets in our master suite closet. Using a battery-powered continuity tester I determined which wire went to which sensor. I just connected the leads to each two-strand wire and had my wife open and close doors until I had the sensors mapped out.As Mike told me, hooking the wired sensors to the S02-A was plug and play. The D-BUS bar provides 12-volt power for the sensors--I measured it at 11.4 volts, close enough. Using red and black 18-guage speaker wire  and some small, gray wire nuts, I connected the sensor wires to the positive and common terminals on D-BUS bar.When I switched the system on, it immediately recognized the wired sensors, and assigned them zone numbers starting with 9, such as 90, 91, 92, etc. We tested the sensors, and they worked perfectly.I only worked with door sensors, not the old motion detector. Since the wired zones started with 9, I don't believe they can be programmed to turn off when the system is in home mode. I  would also have to figure out how to connect all four wires to the D-BUS. For an extra $25 bucks I just kept things simple and bought a third motion sensor from Fortress.I did figure out how to connect my old wired siren to the S02. I didn't like the siren provided by Fortress because it had a short cord, and would have to be located very close to the alarm console. I figured that would just lead someone to the console so they could smash it. The old wired siren was located in another part of the house.The siren hooks up to the console using a mono 3.5mm plug. I purchased a 3.5mm mono cable from Radio Shack for five bucks, cut it in half, connected it to the old siren wires, and plugged it in. I didn't want to cut up the new siren to use the mono plug, and the cable from RS was much beefier and easier to work with anyway. Set off the alarm and the wired siren worked great.I purchased the black wireless siren from Fortress to make extra noise in our garage.  Worked great, but had one drawback. I couldn't hear the old wired siren from the driveway, so I couldn't hear the chirps telling me the alarm was set or disabled. Unfortunately, the wireless siren does not make those chirps, it only makes noise if the alarm goes off. Oh well. It would be nice if Fortress added a wireless status light to the kits so we can tell if the system is on or off.If I had to do it all over again, I would have bought another of the S02-B systems. But the time I purchased the S02-A, an extra siren, key fob and wireless sensor, I had spent more than $200.

This is very useful regardless as to wither you use the alarm (which you will) or not.  Basically if your line is dead it starts beeping.  This is great to alert you to call your phone company for a problem you would not even know you had.Small touch #2  Two key chain entries.  Other systems only come with one in the set.  I ordered at extra one for $12#3 Modes to remind you to set the alarm of a door you regularly go out of#4  Defeats the old baseball bat smash the unit trick and here is how.  Keychains let you put the unit somewhere secure.  We have a locked office where my phone line is.  Which is perfect.  Another system I looked at has a separate base, which is supposed to solve this problem, but think about it.  If a robber see's the keypad and smashes it, he thinks he has defeated your system.  By the time the police arrive he is long gone.  In this system you HIDE the keypad and use the key chain and then he hears the alarm gets scared and runs away.  Basically what I am saying is that the robber will THINK the brains are in the keypad even if he hears an alarm.  I.E. He will think that is a local alarm, and nothing to worry about.  But in this system because you get two keychains you NEVER use the keypad at all, and you just hide it or lock it somewhere.  To do that with other systems you need to order MORE keychains.#5 Support is great. Quick, and easy, call and they answer. The manual is pretty clear but there is a lot to read.  Don't skim like I did and you will have no problems installing.#6  Keypad is solid.  Buttons push well, not junk, high quality.#7  Wireless sensors tops pop off for EASY battery replacement#8 Home alarm mode turns off motion sensors.  Very easy to work system with keychain, disarm, arm away, arm home, panic#9 Love the included dedicated remote panic. Put it by the bed.  Now lets say My wife is at home and I am shopping and she has a problem, she feels sick or fell, and can't really use the phone.  She hits that and walah I get a call.  Or if someone comes to the door, she hits that and the alarm goes off and I get a call.  I really LOVE the fact that YOU decide who gets the call. I want the call not some monitoring site, where I have to pay lots of extra money, and also have false alarms where the irritated cops come out.#10 You can dial in and control the system.  And when you get the call * lets you HEAR what is going on.  Say maintance comes over,  I can listen in on what they are doing.#11 Price,  you get 8 sensors, two key chains, and a panic alarm for $120 that is CRAZY, half the price of the completion and the ONLY thing this system doesn't have is cellphone calls.  But we have a real phone line, so it works for us.  If they added cell also it would be practically perfect.basically I love this thing.  I love the fact that it solves so many MORE problems than just security.  Like the my phone is out problem.  Or the  I can't dial a phone problem, You think I am nuts about this, but let me tell you I have had a concusion once in a car crash and I was not able to \"think\" well enough to use a phone, even though I could walk around.  If that happened at home I could hit the BIG RED button and my wife would be coming home, or visa versa.  That is a REAL BIG PLUS.One tip.  Don't install the sticky tape on the back of the sensors before pulling off the silver number sticker and putting it on the front of the sensor.  This makes remembering which sensor is which easy.Seriously BELIVE the good reviews on this.

My system uses the two battery-powered motion detectors that came with the kit.  I had requested \u201cpet immune\u201d sensors from the seller (via email) just after ordering thru Amazon, and the seller replied \u201cyes,\u201d but while the sensors that arrived have no marking to indicate that they are in fact the \u201cpet immune\u201d variety, the cat has never triggered a motion sensor.- My configuration isn\u2019t typical.  The wireless system replaced an older wired system, and I was surprised to see that the new system includes connections for up to 7 wired sensors.  The instructions state that the new unit requires 12 Vdc to take advantage of the wired connections.  I asked the seller about requirements for current and regulation for this 12 Vdc power, but he pled ignorance (and didn\u2019t offer to find out).  At my own risk, I bought a 12 Vdc regulated converter for this purpose ($7.89 from Amazon) and connected the existing wires that led to three existing door sensors.  Fortunately, they all worked and it is possible to program the control unit to add a delay to any of the wired zones. I was able to add a delay to the front door circuit.  (Instructions state that the a delay is fixed at 30 seconds but it is 18 seconds on my unit, and 18 seconds sometimes isn\u2019t enough in my case).- There are a number of drawbacks to the system, as you\u2019ve no doubt read elsewhere.  The biggest, in my opinion, is that the system doesn\u2019t tell you if any doors are open when you attempt to arm the system.  There\u2019s no reason why it couldn\u2019t have been designed that way.  The wireless door sensors all report when a door has just opened, but they also could have been designed to report that a door has just closed \u2013 that way the control unit could keep track of all door zones and let you know that a door isn\u2019t closed when you try to leave.  The designer\u2019s intent may have been to maximize battery life of the door sensors.  However, the system also ignores the fact that a wired door is open when you attempt to arm the system, and wired doors don\u2019t use batteries.  In any event, there\u2019s no fix for this.- Another well-known problem is that the control unit can be smashed by an intruder, and that would silence both the small \u201csiren\u201d that is part of the package and it would also silence an external wireless \u201csiren\u201d that you can add to the kit (for a whopping $49).  The small but very loud \u201csiren\u201d that comes with the kit is connected by a short (maybe 3-foot) pair of wires, and that will help an intruder quickly locate the control unit.  The control unit will attempt to call one or more programmed phone numbers upon triggering, but the call may or may not be completed if the control unit is destroyed first.- However, the kit comes with two small wireless remotes that can arm and disarm the system, so you won\u2019t normally need to use the control unit\u2019s keyboard after it\u2019s been set up to operate with the other wireless devices.  Instead, you can hide the wireless remotes in an easily accessible place of your choice near the entry door (behind a flower arrangement, behind a curtain, etc.) and use the remotes to arm and disarm the system.  You can then put the control unit in a cabinet or behind the couch to keep it out of sight, but you\u2019ll also need to splice a pair of extension wires between the control unit and its \u201csiren\u201d so that the \u201csiren\u201d doesn\u2019t reveal the control unit\u2019s location.  Put the \u201csiren\u201d where it isn\u2019t easily found, such as behind a bookshelf or on top of a tall cabinet.  (And hide the control unit where you can still hear it when it beeps to tell you that it has responded to commands from the remotes.)- My kit came with an instruction booklet that was intended for a different system.  The kit included a single sheet of instructions to quickly set up the system, and the first instruction was to download the correct instructions.  The downloaded instructions were written very poorly, in my opinion, and are made worse because they are obviously a translation by someone whose native language isn\u2019t English.- The control unit contains a chargeable battery pack that is supposed to keep it operational for about a day if house power is lost.  The external (optional) \u201csiren\u201d is powered by 12 vdc from an AC adaptor and there is no battery backup for it.  Finally, in my situation, battery backup is required for the wired door sensors.  To provide my own battery backup, I bought a 12 volt, 5AH sealed lead-acid (SLA) battery (around $15 at Costco).  To keep the battery charged, I connected it to a \u201cMini-Box picoUPS-100 12V DC micro UPS system / battery backup system\u201d ($27.33 from Amazon).  The picoUPS is powered by an unregulated 16 Vdc adaptor that you plug into a wall receptacle (under $10 from Amazon).  The picoUPS unit in turn automatically controls a charge current, as needed, to the battery.  The battery supplies power to the control unit for the wired sensors and to the external \u201csiren.\u201d  The charged battery\u2019s output is about 14 volts, but the control unit and the \u201csiren\u201d normally use a 12 volt source.  To lower the battery\u2019s normal 14 volt output to about 12 volts (not sure this is necessary, but it typically prolongs the life of the items that use this power), I put a pair of 1N4001 diodes (Radio Shack) in series with the battery output to lower the voltage seen by the control unit and \u201csiren\u201d to about 12 Vdc.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "varry nice", "Author": "BBhBhfBhfsBhfsfBhfsfgBhfsfgjBhfsfgjfBhfsfgjfd...", "ReviewID": "R3SEGUBSD2Q2NV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can't say enough good about this product.

You could stick the magnet on this type of door frame as is, but it would be highly improbable that a good bond would be created, and you are limited by a maximum 1/2 inch spacing between the magnet and the detector.

That one also only came with two door/window sensors and this system includes 5, plus an extra key fob, and the Skylink has only one motion detector and this system has two.

I expected to have to purchase an extra phone cord but one was in the box.  Two, from the graphic on the sales page it didn't appear that any signage/stickers were included that would indicate that the house is protected by an alarm system.  Two large stickers were included in the box, which is great.  Perhaps as a separate sales item on the company website or here on Amazon you could offer an option for a yard sign as well. Any extra deterrence helps.It took about an hour to install the system and with the siren disconnected I opened a door while the system was armed. Within about 30 seconds my cell phone rang and the message I'd recorded was played. Pretty impressive.For those about the install this system, I'd suggest that you switch the arm/disarm notification tone on the main panel from 'chirp', which gives off an obnoxious, jarring little blast from the siren - to beep.While there is a wireless siren available, my only real concern with this unit out of the box is that the siren simply plugs into the main panel.

I need something that will work when I need it to.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not for me.", "Author": "motorcyclemamma", "ReviewID": "R2ISHMMTQ1DRTX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Didn't work for us.

Was a bit confusing until the email with the link to videos arrived. Then it was a breeze. The alarm is loud inside the house, but cant be heard outside (I think). It dials both phone numbers, but having some trouble setting up the message. Having some issues with the telephone line and whether it interferes with the internet in the house. Working on resolving it. Otherwise great product, particularly the motion sensors etc. Like the key fob remotes as well.

I returned the faulty alarm to Amazon and they gave me a full refund.  I ordered the Fortress Alarm and it works great!

I spent four hours setting up the system, mounting units into the walls, door and windows, seemed to work fine. Noticed problem if a window was already open, system wouldn't arm; this can be a problem in the summertime, and I didn't understand why if the window sensors keyed off of the magnets being moved, but whatever. Only downside, and I was going to figure something out as I NEED the windows cracked occasionally. However, the next day, the main unit stopped working altogether. Display was constant \"88\" or \"66\" or something unintelligible, and was completely non-responsive. Even removing power didn't help. Packed it all back up and shipped it back. Very upset for a system that says right on the box, \"Security that just WORKS\".Be aware, I then purchased a similar item on eBay, from China, that looked JUST like the fortress system. WORTHLESS. wrong power supply, not the same features, cheaper electronics. stopped working, also. Sent it back, too.I'm very disappointed after reading the reviews here, and to be honest, with the features, it was well worth the cost and I was going to recommend this to all my family; not a small number of units I could have sold for Fortress :) Now, I don't know. I'm going to order the system above this one (I still think it's better than the other systems, if it would just work. I need more window sensors and another key fob, also, so I ordered up) and give this company another chance..
