To begin with, it isn't exactly easy to install.  Be prepared for some planning and drilling, since the cameras are all wired, but it is all worth it.  The DVR is nearly silent, so you can place it just about anywhere.  I used an old computer monitor with it, but it has an HDMI output, so you could just connect it to your TV.  After setting that up (which is super easy), you need to mount the cameras.  The tilt and pan camera is amazing.  Once you mount it, you can control it even with the smartphone apps (I used the iPhone one).  The other cameras mount in a fixed position, so I put the pan and tilt in the center of my main living area, placing the fixed ones down the hall, and one outside facing the driveway (yes they're weatherproof!).  After setting up the system, I decided to play with the clarity and night vision.  If you've seen Ghost Hunters, you know what you're working with.  What amazed me was the clarity of the night vision.  I wrote \"can you read this?\" on a piece of paper and placed it on the table about 15 feet from the main camera.  I turned off the lights, and I could read it easily in the complete darkness!I don't live in a high crime area, but I like being able to check on the home while away.  This added just the right amount of security for me.  I cannot recommend this more highly!", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is the one.

I was scared of throwing away hundreds on garbage so I spent days reviewing DVRs and cameras (BTW I notice there is a (assuming) competitor of Q-See that writes all-caps bad reviews on other QSee products--look at his/her comments and the wording is all the same, copy paste on multiple items with no specifics).The software interface is a breath of fresh air, very clean, not just on the box menu system itself, but through the web interface as well. I am using Chrome and it is working great. Remote viewing of my home security cameras, good to go. Some of the options available on the DVR are really nice. One example is the very well designed screen to block out areas you don't want to trigger the record-on-motion-detected.Instructions are written by a native English speaker (can't take that for granted nowadays). The instructions for getting the system connected for remote access are thorough and cover both UPnP and DMZ for the router setup. The cameras work as expected, no complaints there.So far, very good. Will post an update if there are any developments otherwise.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent product...however", "Author": "JS Lurkin", "ReviewID": "R1BU8GY27R7S9H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I read documents for 4 days prior to attempting installation and setup. I worked and read for 2 more days during setup. When I called for help, the agent was snippy, anxious to get me off the phone, and sent me something else to read.Your documentation ( and you certainly have plenty of it ), although written by a native English speaker, certainly wasn't written by someone with a sixth grade knowledge of punctuation or grammar.It appears as though product development, your technical writers and software development have only limited communication with one another.During the setup process I was prompted to enter \"the\" IP address in various and sundry locations. Which IP address?  I was working with 3 of them: One for the router, one for the computer and one for the dvr.Setup for the iPhone was accomplished as a result of reading a user review. iPhone automatically changes the \"a\" in \"admin\" to upper case. Upper case \"A\" doesn't work. Software development could have resolved this in advance.Functionality for the ipad was accomplished by trial and error and limited help from the same software review. Again, software development failed. Further, I couldn't find a solution while performing a search in Knowledge Base. Your technical writers failed.Once you back up a file, you can't back it up a second time. It's still on the hard drive. You can see it. But you just can't copy it for police use. Their IT guy needs your hard drive for that which means your security system is shut down until it's replacedHard drive replacement as outlined in the most current downloadable instructions for QT series says a standard desktop, SATA, 3.5\"' 1 TB, 7200 rpm hard drive is required. Further tells which screws to remove and electrical precautions.Damned if they didn't forget to tell you it needs to be AV rated.  Damned if they didn't forget to tell you the disk then needs to be formatted after it's installed.All of the things their technical writers forgot to tell me throughout the setup and maintenance of the  system have overshadowed any pleasant experience for which I might have hoped.Still...great hardware. Plug and play it ain't.You have an excellent product with marvelous capabilities, durability, packaging....  I couldn't be happier with those issues. Your customer support, technical writers and software development really suck, however.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "pretty good (features, performance) vs price", "Author": "Vance", "ReviewID": "R2GS4WV7H7SJEJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I coupled this with 4 Q See night vision cameras and it is simple yet functional. I was hesitant about those systems that were clean and slick to look at but I found out the only way to access menus and control was either from the all in one remote or the mouse. God forbid if the remote got lost or broken then how do you even turn the darn thing on/off. So I admit I am a bit of a traditionalist/hybrid when it comes to electronics. The performance is good, it provides settings for qvga or vga (good/better) images. The unit is lightweight but shell feel solid enough, I put my flat screen monitor on top of it without denting the top of the shell. The back has options for output (VGA, HDMI) which I used the HDMI into a 19\" led TV that I found on sale. The menu setup is not as user friendly or intuitive as I'd like but once I played around I kind of understood where/why they put it under what folder.Pro:-Price was usually less than other if not comparable/cheaper than generic no names-Build is better than most I explored-Q See is a name I know of-Compatible with my Swann nanny cams too! In the works for patching them in somehow, if I need to,  I have no problems buying another Q See DVR-Can access menu through optical mouse (included) or button.-Playback remote included w/ batteries-Can be usb backup via external hard driveCons:-The buttons on the unit do not light up...non contrasting scheme makes it somewhat difficult to read.-Menus/software not as user friendly but still better than most I can say that!! Still easier to use than zmodos menusTIP: in menu when searching for recorded files and/or images (in file management) if not sure about time, leave search empty - select the day and just click search. It will pull up the whole day's records.-Remote and mouse feels cheap but it serves its function well. The mouse is USB and optical FYI.-There is no separate manual on/off switch. If you want to shut it down you must go through the menu and it takes longer than I thought to actually shut down or use the stop/esc button on DVR and hold it for 2 secs. The on/off that is supposed to work which is the left button with the red does not turn ON the unit. With no manual toggle..I literally have to unplug it and replug it for it to turn on. Don't know why that is but I see common complains about the same thing and I thought maybe I would not get a buggy unit..I think it maybe design. It is still not enough for me to return it though.Overall, I am pretty happy with it. I will stress that you should couple this with a set of decent cameras though. More tvl means clearer pics so the qsee cams I bought are pretty good considering the price. They are the bullet style cams 600 tvls. Decent detail and fairly accurate color at 30 ft give or take. A few of my indoor mini cams are 450 tvls and u can seen the difference. Generally the safer bet for outside is dont go below 500tvl if that. I didn't need the detail indoors so that's fine. Outdoors I say spring for the better details so u have something substantial for police reports. Decent lower res cam can run about 30 to 60 bucks. The decent tvl res cams will hit about the 50 to 100+ range. Then u have pro which can get insane with pan tilt room etc 150 to hundreds more. I will tweek some of the settings some more on a later date but for now, I see my mailman/UPS dude tossing my mail around like bocci ball and neighbors that don't clean up after their pups..WTH!UPDATE: 11/1/2013 - I expanded my system and purchased a zmodo 8 ch dvr. I am using both just separated them by duty. I will say compared to the zmodo, I still like the functionality of the menus on the qsee more. The Qsee allows to search files by events i.e. motion, power loss etc. The zmodo - it gives a time grid as well with blue range markers to narrow the time frame but unless you have an idea, it seems you maybe replaying the whole day when you were gone. I also noticed that real time display seems clearer from the qsee dvr than the zmodo and I checked the advanced settings. The qsee was running either HDMI or VGA - the zmodo I tried coaxial/RCA and VGA (the zmodo has no HDMI). Eitherway the results were the same and yes, I used the same 600 TVL qsee cams in NTSC/D1.", "Date": "September 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "A worthy first step into a pro-style security camera setup", "Author": "Bill Nicholas", "ReviewID": "R1UBN082THNI6Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have tried numerous consumer-oriented IP cameras, but this is the first pro-style model I have tried. I know from experience with multiple other cameras that these cameras usually start out as professional models, or are made by professional surveillance companies, and are adapted for the consumer market. When that happens, the packaging and marketing text makes it sound like it is easy to get them up and running by the average user, but it is a veneer that wears off once you start trying to set it up. Q-See does fall into that category, but they executed the setup process better than most I have tried. The bottom line is, I ended up getting everything to work as advertised with less frustration.Pros:1) They try to make it easier for the average user with large installation posters with a lot of photo illustrations2) The automatic setup software actually worked, for once3) Cameras provide a nice field of view4) Appears to be well made and designed to weather the elements5) Night vision is usable6) Overall, they succeed in avoiding requiring the user to buy a networking dictionary, but you still need to dig a little to understand some terminology7) Viewing IP cameras on a smartphone has been one of the biggest challenges I have had with IP cameras. Some I have tried simply never worked, even though the manufacturer says it's possible. Others I have gotten to work for reasons I cannot explain. The best thing I can say about this product is that I can view the cameras over my smartphone, so I'm not going to push my luck. However, the apps they provide apparently give many peoples issues (see Cons below)Cons:1) Instructions are still not as easy as I think they need to be for the average user. While parts of the instructions were easy to understand and follow, they did not necessarily flow from one thing to the next. I am really not sure how I got everything working. Seems like I jumped around between instruction sheets and steps. I also had to do some searching on their web site. I had to install several pieces of software and drivers, but I'm not quite sure yet what they are for, or how to work them. I doubt I could guide someone else through how to set it up. Still, somehow, I got it to work2) While the automatic setup software worked for me, if it doesn't for you, then you are thrown into the daunting world of port forwarding! This is something all other IP cameras I have used I have had to deal with. Digging into your router's settings is not the most user friendly process3) The consumer friendly veneer wears off the deeper you go. The more you go into the settings sections, the more it looks like territory only a security or network professional could love. Still, like I mention in the Pros section, they do abetter job of explaining than other products I have used4) There is no wireless anything on this product. For the sake of security, everything is wired. This means you have to figure out where you want your cameras and then determine if there is a place for the dvr to go that allows all the wires to be connected. Of course, you have to run the wires to and fro, meaning you may need to get on the roof. The dvr also needs to be hard wired to your network, otherwise you need to connect it to a TV or monitor. I think most people are going to want to use it on their desktop and/or smartphone, though. This, then, requires the dvr to be connected to the network. I ended up placing the dvr in the loft space in my garage. I connected it to the network using powerline adapters. It worked5) When setting it up, you need to see a screen of some sort. The way I did it was I temporarily moved my dvr to near my desktop and plugged my computer monitor into it. This allowed me to follow the setup screen instructions to set up port forwarding. Once that is done, you can move the dvr back to where you want it. Then, I was able to use the viewing software on my computer to continue setup and monitor the cameras6) The smartphone software they provide is confusing. They have a lot of different versions and it is hard to figure out which one to use. The only way I figured it out was by going to their web site, searching for android apps, inputting some info and finding the exact app for me. The only other issue with the apps is that the viewer ratings for most of theirs is very poor. It worked on my phone, but it looks like many people have some major issuesSo, basically, I can say this: So far, so good. These cameras look and perform like high end security cameras, compared to the plastic cased, over-styled consumer IP cameras I have been using. Despite a lot of little things to assemble and setup, I did actually get the system to work as advertised with a lot less frustration that other IP cameras I have used. As a first step into a pro-style security camera setup, I believe the Q-See system is a good start for the average user, as long as you are willing to invest the time and effort needed to set it up, i.e., it's still not simple and easy.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good, comprehensive home surveillance kit", "Author": "Sibelius", "ReviewID": "R2QEWXDEQCP1OT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After a month of use I've come to appreciate the peace of mind that this particular Q-See kit provides.  Functionality is fairly robust for domestic usage with a 1 Terabyte DVR (8 camera inputs), 3 stationary bullet cams and a nifty pan-tilt camera all enabled with remote viewing capability to allow monitoring through phone/tablet/computer apps wherever you may be located.Some thoughts on this kit:+Setup is fairly easy with better than expected instructions.  However, because I use this set in a 1900 square foot, 2 story home most of the 50 feet cabling was not adequate for my needs so I did purchase nearly a thousand feet of additional cabling in order to place the cameras in my desired locales.+Wired cameras > Wireless.  Trust me, I've used several other wireless kits in the past and while I loved the ease of setup and lack of cabling hassles I often encountered battery/power issues and inconsistent connectivity.+The image quality of the included cams = Great!  The resolution is plenty sharp and the night vision modes are sharper than I expected with ample range illuminated in view.+Really appreciate the weatherproof cameras that allows for greater placement options (eg - outdoor patio).+Love the remote viewing capability.  The iPhone app works great and I find great joy in being able to peek at my dogs and children whilst away from home.Overall a very nice set with very well made and thought out components (they even include a mouse and remote control for utilization with the DVR interface).  My only wish is the inclusion of longer cables because as it is right out of the box the kit seems designed for small, 1 room type businesses and will require a bit more investment for proper placement in homes.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "do not buy", "Author": "edward lind", "ReviewID": "R3ONQ93AH6INIM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the product is pretty good.

Recently when we had visitors at the cabin and some noises were heard outside. I was able to check it on my smartphone and able to actually see that it was just a few deer that were foraging for food.Setup of the cameras is simple, the software is downloadable from the website and took very little time.

If I am away from a PC, I can quickly look at the pictures in the email on the Iphone or log into the Qsee app to watch the video of the event.The only downside to this package is the quality of the cables.

Of course it's not Full HD... but given the use of these cameras, it is unlikely you'll need more than that. The night vision capabilities is IMPRESSIVE... you really can see perfectly at a large distance. The manufacturer claims 100 feet. Although I did not measure, I must say those cameras allow me to see (in darkness) as far as I need and probably more. I'm totally satisfied there!The wide-angle lenses are a good compromise giving you a good angle of vision without the typical distortion of wider angle lenses.

It didn't miss minute of its scheduled delivery time, the shipping and factory packing were intact, very organized and easy to unpack, installation took about 2 days (My house is a ranch style with 1200 SQFT of shop) eight channels/cameras are not enough for my property but good enough.FUNCTIONALITY CHECK: Don't waste a minute of your time to start the installation phase before you will check its functionality, simply it will be waste of time to find defective item after compilation of installation and end up sending back the whole package, remove all the cameras and connect to DVR and see day time and night time before attempting to permanently install them, it's not that sellers will intentionally ship you defective product but it happens.INSTALLATION: as mentioned it took me 2 days to run the wires due to concrete drilling and low crawling in the attic in about 100 degrees heat. Even though the wires are long enough to reach from the camera location to the COMMAND  center, any installer must expect getting additional video/power cable and (MALE) connector, sometimes you just cannot run it straight line, two of mine each took 100 feet cable luckily I had 4 50ft extra cables in hand. (This is a plug and play) or simply easy to install thing, you don't need to be what they call (professional?) I don't think so! make sure you identify which side of the cable goes to the camera and which side goes to the DVR, if you just pool a 50ft cable in a attic and end up pulling it back, it just feels like bad day! NOTE: Please DO NOT leave the cable wrapped make sure you UNWRAP all of it, even when you don't need the whole 50 feet to do the job! If you leave it wrapped the cable heats up and can even caught on fire, this have something to do with electric current circulation in the wire, I had two of them left wrapped and when I went inside the attic and check they were both smelling like burned plastic and really hot, I am luck I didn't do this the 2nd day or hour, this happened in 7 to 10 minutes.SETTUP: After you are done with installation grab your favorite drink and take 10 to 20 minutes rest to refresh yourself, now everything is plugged in and your TV is set to display your cameras, \" POWER ON\" your DVR and follow onscreen instruction to change your default USER NAME and PASSWORD (CREATE YOUR OWN USER NAME AND PASSWORD)  because all the default ones are default for many other models.  in my case the 1st thing I did was run the RJ45 from my secure DVR room to my router, this is done as part of the whole installation (THIS SYSTEM DOES NOT SUPPORT WIFI)  you cannot connect it to your LAN using wifi, you definitely need free network port on your switch/router. Insert the CD into your pc/laptop and install the software (mine didn't work with win7 64 so I went on their website and download the latest version. Now your remote monitoring from the PC/MAC side is done. go to app/play store and download the app that is made for your specific model, you will find an option to scan ( A BARCODE)  located on top of your DVR, scan it and it will give you an option to login.

The QT model series in particular is easy to work with, and has better app support than some others.  It even has a PTZ control, in case you want to add a PT or PTZ camera.2.  This particular model of camera, as I later learned, is inferior to current Q-See cameras with similar features.  I have installed this model before, and usually had to deal with nothing other than washed-out color images (a trademark of this model).  My luck on this transaction was worse.  Of the 4 cameras, all had out-of-focus, fish-eyed images that could not be corrected.  On 2 of the cameras, the night vision pictures were too dark.Conclusion:  Because of the particular model of cameras, your purchase is a gamble.

When the DVR restarts it makes a loud beeping noise which is rather annoying, in addition to your recording being interrupted.Based on one bad camera and the seemingly unreliable DVR i decided to return immediately rather than risking having to pack it back up later on after a painful installation process.An additional note for people wanting to install any of the cameras indoors: Be advised that the cameras will make a relatively loud clicking noise as they transition between day and night vision.

So I ordered it.I wired it before it arrived at my house. I bought 4x4x2 crylon boxes and after I had all the wires in place (6 exterior, 2 interior), I mounted the Crylon boxes outside and mounted the Cameras to those. It looks really sharp. I have already gotten compliments o how it looks.I then bought a nice little 16 inch flat screen dedicated for my DVR. (It was 80 bucks). I set the DVR up which was mostly straight forward. A few options they put into places I'm not used too but no big deal there. All manufacturers have their own scheme. I really like the interface though and how it looks. BIG name brands like Samsung have clunkier schemes. I hooked it up to the internet and was viewing these bad boys on my phones and computers in the house within minutes. Easiest Network setup I have ever done.The only real \"complaint\" I have it that the 2 interior cameras have a really hard time staying in their color/day mode. Ill check at 3pm with ample light and they will be in dark/black and white mode. Kind of annoying but I will move them around and see if I can get better ambient lighting for them. Not really a big complain....just something I need to work on.Overall, I recommend this.

WOW. The Playback also works well for me, despite me using Windows 8 and IE 11. If you have an older QS, this will work with the CIF cams, but don't expect it to be perfect. In addition this will work in conjunction with other QSEE boxes. It also has a low hard drive warning, sends and email with defaults of disk space left. This would REALLY be useful for my mailbox/package cam. I get a package and camera senses movement, send me an email. Not sure what else to get excited about, there are 2 audio jacks, you need to buy another mic for that from what I understand. I use a Static set of IPs, so I can just make a static name on the internet like XYZ.mycompany.com, but you being a home user most likely can use the dynamic DNS feature on the box.

My tv does have an HDMI port, but is not hd.  I have an earlier tv, which is enhanced definition.  The problem is the resolution on the dvr I received was set up from the mfg for an hdtv, so I could not see a picture due to my tv not recognizing the resolution.  After several online chats with a pretty much useless rep, I figured out I needed to buy bcd-rca adapter from a well known electronics store so I could hook the output to my rca inputs(my unit came with only  a hdmi cable).  After this, I was able to see the set up menu, change the resolution so I could hook it up to my hdmi jack.The cameras were very good quality with the exception of one, which looked very hazy during night vision mode.

I had been using a high dollar alarm company installed system that cost five times more, and the QT5680 surpassed its older technology for waaaay less. FYI alarm companies still charge five times more for basically the same thing.The cameras included in this system are 600TVL resolution which are very good compared to other packaged systems that come with 420TVL. The cameras provide a clear and true color representation with the IR cut filter. At night the IR LEDs provide just the right amount of light within a reasonable distance.The DVR is very compact and doesn't take up too much space for an 8-channel system. It records at Full D1 resolution for all 8 channels which I believe is today's minimum standard compared to older outdated systems that record at CIF resolution.This DVR also included an option to connect cameras that have built-in microphones so that you may record audio as well. The DVR has user friendly menus and is pretty simple to setup with or without the easy to follow fold-out instructions.Accessing the DVR from an outside network didn't present any problems after properly configuring the router and setting up a Dynamic DNS account.I was impressed with the software ability to access the DVR from my smartphone. The quality of the live feed viewing of the cameras was high as expected. I was very impressed by the feature of being able to search and play back files stored on the DVR from my smartphone. Playback of the video files was very fast with no lag and was very smooth.Overall, I would highly recommend this system for anyone looking to install a decent system on a budget.

One was that I needed wider angle cameras on the side of my house as it is a bit close to a fence. The specifications did not indicate the size of the lens which determine the viewing angle. These cameras seem to have come with 5 or 6mm lens. I had to place these cameras further away from my original intended locations to make up for the narrower views.The other was setting up the mobile app on the network was a pain, don't gorget to set your network security settings to allow things to setup as they should otherwise all will be blocked. Will have to put in some settings into your router if its more than three years old most likely. Most the new ones are plug and play, your mileage may carry in this aspect.

As it turned out, we both read the instructions and they were easy to follow. Written in plain english, everything made sense and was not even remotely confusing. I connected  this to my flat screen through the HDMI port. We planned where the cameras would be mounted. I observed and handed him tools,etc. while my husband attached all the cameras in strategic places around the house again following the manufacturer's easy to follow instructions.The DVR is unobtrusive and slides in easily with all the other home electronics. It is also super quiet. When we were ready to test this out we set up an iPad, iPhone, and computer to access the DVR via softwear provided by Q-SEE. The pan and tilt camera is easy to use and provides great coverage. Ditto for the bullet cameras provided.The night vision capability of the cameras offers a clear picture without additional light sources. Overall, I am impressed by the Q-See's modest price given its performance. It does what you want a home monitoring system to do without costing big bucks. Whether you are monitoring your home for theft, covering the nanny or babsitter's activities, or checking up on the teenagers, this is a great way to know what's happening. While I have a professional home monitoring system which I pay a monthly fee for, this unit is a welcome addition for extra protection.My only gripe is that my home is on the large size at 2600 sq. feet so I wish this particular configuration came with more cameras. I am thinking of looking into buying additional cameras to cover the upstair areas.

The wizard blew up for some reason after I set up the wifi/local network settings so I had to go manual. Some notes so you don't have to go through the pain.  1) If your intranet (local wifi) web interface stops working it might be because your wifi router changed the ip of the dvr, so make sure you go into your router and assign the dvr a static ip.  2) If you use the PnP (plug and play ha-ha-ha, RIGHT! Plug and play my a$$) DDNS option on setting up the box for remote viewing, you have to log into the myq-see.com site and get your own url by setting up an account. Then, to see your system on the internet you address it like this  mynetwork.myq-see.com:85where 85 is the port you forward from the box through your router to the internet, which you have to set up and mynetwork is what YOU have named your network when you registered. A little detail they seemed to have missed on the not so quick startup guide.  3) Whether you're using the myq-see network you signed up for, or you are just using the external ip of your own network YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT THE INTERNET SEES OUTSIDE OF YOUR FIREWALL. Important point missing from the instructions. In other words, you might have a loopback problem seeing the system if you use an external url. Instead of setting up a loopback adapter my advice is to go see it from your office or neighbor or use the Q-see QT phone app which uses the same url and port (and make sure your phone is NOT connected to your home wifi system, but using 4g or something) to check the remote internet viewing. One more time, because this is a killer: you might not be able to check the internet remote viewing from within your own network. Go outside your network to check it. If you want to use the system with computers within your wifi system, use the wifi assigned internal address of the dvr. This will be something like: [...] where 85 is the port the DVR is sending on, unless yours sends on another port.

The setup is very easy, you set the date, mount the cameras and the cords you use have both the video and the power attached together.Since my house has a lot of trees (making it hard to get a bird's eye view), I mounted them low, kept the DVR in my basement and ran the cables out of basement windows (easy to run cable in your basement)The video quality is good even at night (when it is black and what); like watching a VHS tape.  But if something major happens to you, you will wish you had HD.  My car was broken into during the day time, I was very happy to have video of what happened, but if I had HD instead of high resolution I would have had a better look at his face and most importantly, I would have gotten his license plate number (this guy drove to our area to walk around and look in car windows)For the money, it is worth it.  These are the negatives:One camera went bad immediately just from me unplugging the DVR itself.  Even though the power is separate, I guess that sent a surge that blew it out.  Q-See sent me a replacement.A 2nd camera went bad 2 months after having it.  I sent it to Q-See and I hope a replacement is coming.  I was able to see when the camera stopped working and nothing happened to cause it.  It went from recording to being a frozen screen to just dying.So will these last long term?  I tend to think they will not and I don't want to be buying replacement cameras periodically.If you video constantly and use the best quality on all cameras (as I do) you only have 6 days worth of history before the old stuff gets written over.

The fixed cameras are great but it always seems there's one or two spots in the room you can't see. But with the pan/tilt camera nothing is out of your sight. And the fact that they include one in the set for this price is fantastic.And the night vision works fantastically!The really cool thing is you can view your cameras when you're not at home using your Smart phone.

You can easily make out faces and identify people though so it gets the job done.It takes some getting used to the controls and whatnot and I still have not figured out how to save a particular clip from the recording though I am sure I will figure it out.Setting up was easy, though it did take some time.  There was point when I was over thinking things and actually made it harder to view the feed over the internet.

Recently we had our home alarm system upgraded and activated and the company showed us a video surveillance system that is exactly like what Q-See offers here. The thing is if we had the company install their equipment there is an equipment charge and labor installation plus $30 a month for video monitoring including use of a mobile device or PC based viewing system (just like what Q-See offers). Thus my interest in this product was as an add-on to our existing home security system which has professional monitoring.The QT5680-4E4-1 is a wired product so installation and use will require drilling, running wire in walls and some ladder climbing, just be forewarned. You supply a video monitor such as a 19 inch or larger PC monitor with VGA cable or a TV with an HDMI cable and a BNC to RCA cable or adapter. They also recommend the use of a surge protector. I'm sharing these things to explain and so you can equip yourself with what you need when you are ready to install it.The product comes with a poster sized large font quick start installation guide with full color photos. A CD is included with all the fine print for the owner's manual.Some things that make this set remarkable is the fact that it is weatherproof and has night vision as well as DVR abilities that capture 30 frames per second. These are in color except the night vision of course! Unlike a different camera we tried, this does not capture a frame every few seconds which gives a ridiculous stop motion film type quality.I think it's really cool that you can monitor your system while away from home using a mobile device such as an iPhone. We have our security system in place which is professionally monitored and if something happens, no matter where I am I can look to see what is happening from afar. I can also peek in on the house while I am away in case I am curious about what is going on.Q-See offers some other products such as wireless cameras and full color cameras as well.I am impressed to say the least. I rate this product 5 stars = I Love It.The product info here on Amazon is exhaustive and lists the many features and compatibilities. The Q-See website gives a ton of information. I found some customer tutorials on YouTube so you can watch other people using the system and see how they chose to install it in their homes. Q-See also has official videos on YouTube that explain the product. I hope all that information is helpful to you as you shop and compare products.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Product, Well Made", "Author": "Robert Stone", "ReviewID": "R20GI8921C2YVO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm very impressed with this item. I have looked at a number of security cameras including many at a bricks and mortar store and most have a very plastic feel - you can tell that out in the weather they will not hold up. Not so with the Q-See cameras. They feel sturdy and well constructed. Lots of metal.The non-tilt cameras are small enough to be unobtrusive near a front door (which is where I have elected to put one) - and the larger pan-tilt camera is perfect for a back yard with the ability to look all around. A camera aimed at the driveway is a must, of course.Once you have selected locations, get ready to do some drillin' since these are wired cameras. Although there are wireless solutions out there I would not recommend them since, of course, you need to run a wire to them for power anyway unless you want to spend all your time replacing batteries. The included cables are good and they wisely packed them in such a way that you can access both ends - makes testing out the system before installation easy.System set up was also easy and the directions are well done - clearly they were written or corrected by someone who is fluent in English, something that is not always the case in products of this type. I followed the directions step by step and was checking out the quality of the video in just a couple minutes. (Installation of cameras has taken a bit longer of course!)Overall, I'm very impressed with this item which is well made and functional.

It was easy to install and  the instructions are clear. The resolution is acceptable even though it's not HD. Ever watch surveillance footage on TV, like on the news when a crime has been committed and the authorities need the public's help identifying the perpetrator? And the video is terrible and you wonder why? If the victim had one of these systems installed you'd look at the footage and say (for example) \"Hey, that's my brother-in-law\" instead of \"Well, we might be able to help if you hadn't cheaped out on you security system...\"Seriously, there's no point in installing a system if it doesn't provide usable video. You might as well install dummy deterrent cameras and keep your fingers crossed. You can pay more and get HD but it's not really necessary.This is an excellent choice for either the home or small business user. The night vision is rated to 100 feet but realistically  is most visible in the under 50 foot range but that should be adequate for most users.Everything you need is in the box. It's expandable to 8 cameras if needed, and has audio capability if needed. The 1 terabyte hard drive provides plenty of storage and it has streaming ability.This unit also comes with a remote control if you prefer to use the unit that way instead of using your mouse or one of the free mobile apps.Q-see has a pretty good name in the  industry, I'll admit that I wasn't familiar with the company until I started researching them. They have an excellent website with support tips, installation help, and contact information readily available if you need further assistance. They seem to be committed to quality and in the business for the long haul.

I can know view from my smartphone from anywhere I am, as well as my computer.  No charges for viewing this way except on your data plan or better yet if you have access to wifi then it's free.  Comcast, or other services charge you $30 a month and you can view it for free.  That is a savings of $360 a year.  In 2 years the system pays for itself.

That said, if you're planning to DIY, take his words with a grain of salt because--well, he's a professional with all the right tools, equipment, and patience.Setting up the system was easy enough--using an old 24\" LCD computer monitor and a powerline network adapter (otherwise you'd need to hardwire it to your router or modem)--though their user interface could stand to be a little friendlier. That said, once acquainted with the system, it's rather simple, straightforward, and quick to administer. Their iOS and Android apps aren't the shiniest I've witnessed, but they function and allow the system to be administered remotely.The image quality is good, certainly better than some of I've seen, though not as crisp as others. Basically, image quality is above average. My only disappointment is with the night-vision, which doesn't provide as much detail as I anticipated, but it's certainly adequate--you'd be able to read a license plate from some 30 ft away, but beyond that it gets rather grainy.Overall, this is a quality budget surveillance system if you want something to use alongside your home's security/alarm system.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "As advertised but the system failed to function", "Author": "New Favorite", "ReviewID": "R2QGXK6ONECTB3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The dvr failed to work I was pleased with the look and the size but I got a repackaged item that must have been returned because of the failure.

Once you have the cameras mounted and cable run, you should place the power for the DVR unit on a UPS system along with all the cameras so that if there is a power outage you will continue to record video during the event.OperationThe bullet cameras are 700TVL which is the highest resolution that the BNC video interface supports.  Combined with the DVR unit which records at 30 FPS, you will get very high quality recordings from this system.  Many other systems that I have installed over the past 5 years offer much slower frame rate recording.  When watching vandalism or burglaries, you want to see every split-second of the event.  This kit comes with a Full D1 DVR to ensure you can get all those video frames when it really counts.Aside from the four cameras provided, you can also add four more video cameras and two audio inputs if you decide to.In conclusion, the Q-See QT5680 surveillance kit provides everything you will need to start recording video from 4 different locations at your home or office.  The self contained recording unit gives you the flexibility for installation in a closet with just the monitoring cable coming out to a television or even just remote monitoring over your phone.
