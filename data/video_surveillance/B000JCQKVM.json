Also the tuning knob is really a 4 button channel selector.  And why did they ship it with 3 nine-volt connectors and no AC adapter?  But hey, its amazing it works at all for this price.  And the receiver DOES work with a 9-v battery as does the camera.  I was able to get a decent picture more than 20 feet away behind a wall, more clear in the center than the edges, as long as it has adequate lighting.  I plan to use it for impromptu audience interviews and already have a wireless microphone I can tape this thing to, so it will do for now.  Pro-grade wireless cameras or bluetooth streamers sell for 10-x as much, so until prices drop, this is an OK product.", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "really easy to use, didnt last long though", "Author": "RSV", "ReviewID": "R1268ULDBEEB26", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i had it hooked up to look out the front window from inside my house. it was really nice clear picture, good sound but after 3 months of use it started making loud crackling when you had the tv sound on, and the picture started to go fuzzy too. eventually couldnt even use it anymore. Great cheap product if you arent planing anything long term", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nooo", "Author": "Rymer", "ReviewID": "RJD486FM4ZF8B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ok, i got it, what about now?? pssssit is not what i expected, i really don't like it.X", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Does not work for me", "Author": "J.

Also, I could not tune in a picture (well, I could, but it was very noisy) and this is with the camera and receiver about 4 feet apart.  I tried all 4 channels with identical results.Also, it seems flakey that you have to \"tune\" the receiver.  It has a tuning knob you have to adjust for a good picture - just like an old analog radio.  Does not seem appropriate in our current digital electronics age.Does not work for me.  It is going back.  Your milage may very.
