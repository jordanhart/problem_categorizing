The cameras that came with it were terrible to say the least. I wanted to see what else I could get. I purchased one of these to see how it compared. I figured out that I wanted something 700TVL, Dome, White, Wide-Angle, Day/Night. Looking at prices/reviews it didn't take long for me to find this one.-This has the best resolution you can get without going to IP cameras (which my system isn't set up for).-The camera itself was easy to install.-The difference in image quality (both day and night) between these and the 480tvl bullet cams I had, is amazing. Color and resolution. From across the room, looking at the monitor for my DVR, you can tell which channel the new camera is on.-It's white and a dome, it blends into my soffit much better than the black bullet cams that came with my kit.-No problems so far with any of them, they all worked right out of the box.-Wish it came with a power supply plug, seems these are usually sold separate though.Basically, this was a major upgrade from what I had and I will buy enough for the rest of my DVR channels in the near future, as budget allows.", "Date": "September 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "amazing upgrade", "Author": "BillyETX", "ReviewID": "R1K0Z0F5V0GSN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This being my first 700 TVL camera to purchase I can't judge the quality much To other 700 tvl except comparing it to my stock zmodo bullet (Supposed 480tvl) cameras.

The quality is far superior, ir-cut filter gives true colors and the night vision is amazing even in places where there isn't any light.

The stock Swann PRO-530 cameras are adequate to good quality - however, I wanted to see if image quality could be stepped up. This camera is a noticeable improvement in both day and night quality, more accurate color reproduction, and a slightly wider field of view, which is generally desirable. I don't think consumer-grade CCTV can be much improved beyond this camera at present- $51 for a state of the art is huge value.

I wanted this camera to be mounted same height  as my door bell getting a direct view of the face or license plate.  Camera is made of metal, can easily be painted with latex house paint not making it so noticeable.Lens is held on by bottom ring that unscrews left to right, remove ball lens, mount base held on with screws, position camera ball  as needed, tighten ring will secure camera.  If you plan to mount in an area that has a porch light or some sort of landscape illumination, works perfect. Most night vision cameras are black and white with limit viability but in complete darkness, this camera viewing is good. Tape or use shrink tubing on connections to assure they won't come undone, I use a T25 Arrow Stapler Amazon sells for $30, with 9/16 staples.  Wire not long enough? Purchase  BNC Female to Female Coupler Adapters Pack of 10 - $4 allowing additional wires to be connected with no loss of signal or camera quality. CCTV wire 65' - $6.  Need longer runs, VideoSecu 150 Feet Wire $14 excellent wire.  Wire can be painted with latex house paint for better installation look.  My neighbor thinks I'm paranoid but I installed a camera about 3 feet off the ground in my landscape area near sidewalk pointing in the direction of vehicle travel so I can have a direct view of vehicles pulling into my property or driving past able to see perfectly license plates.  Next time my Christmas UPS packages are stolen, I'll have video to see who the creep was.For $38, the camera works perfect, I purchased two more.  Only CON would be the ring that held the lens on was very difficult to unscrew from the factory.  I  had to use a pipe wrench and place in vise to get it unscrewed.  I did scratch the finish but I planned on painting the camera same color as my house.  Two other cameras I purchased did not have this issue and unscrewed perfectly.Consider mounting this camera at face level and this is the perfect camera to buy.  Criminals when they see these cameras mounted up high only need to wear a baseball cap, look downward and the camera will never capture the creeps face.You won't be unhappy and if you are for some reason, Amazon makes it very easy to return.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT", "Author": "Animalover", "ReviewID": "RA8S5OMBV8JXB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Item function as described, clear image qualities, easy to install and very affordable.

Therefore I started shopping around for different cameras with a higher TVL, my first purchase was a GW 600 TVL CCD camera with an above-average picture but still not quite what I was looking for, the Evertech was my second camera I purchased and I am very impressed so far. The picture quality is much better, the night vision is a touch fuzzy yet still better than any other I own. installation was simple, and of course with Amazon Prime I only had to wait two days to get it which is great. After purchasing this, I decided to try a very similar looking and priced camera however had an 850 TVL in a CMOS image sensor, this Evertech outshines the newer camera in every way. In fact I will be returning the 850 TVL and purchasing a second one of these and will eventually replace them all wish this model its just solid value. Also, I see a lot of reviews about bad night vision on alot of camera models, the reality is simply that good outdoor night vision cannot be expected from a camera with only 24 LEDs, i know this because I have 4 different models/brands and none are really \"great\". If good night vision is important to you than you'll simply need more LEDs .", "Date": "April 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "works great", "Author": "Joseph A Kantola", "ReviewID": "R1YUC98C9SD87W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "1-23-2014  -  I have bought 4 of these cameras, which seem to work well with my system.

I think this camera is probably my favorite, despite a lack of any kind of OSD, and its fixed lens.  It's well built, has very good image quality, and has a small footprint.  There's not much else to ask for. I can't say for sure but I strongly suspect that this a rebranded Dahua camera based on its design and specs.The image quality is incredible when hooked up directly to my monitor.  I can't comment if it's truly 700 TVL but it absolutely transmits video at a higher quality than my DVR supports.  Something to keep in mind is that his camera has a 3.6mm lens, which is a wide angle, so the further away you get from the camera, the fuzzier the image.  The lens is fixed, so there really isn't anything you can do about this.  If you get a non wide angle lens camera, you'll bet a cleaner image but the downside is that it can be like looking through a paper towel role when it comes to the field of view.In terms of video quality, it will be hard to find anything better in an analog system.  What you'll pay for is the on screen programming (very useful if it's kept in a shadow and is directed towards sunlight) and adjustable focus.  If you're looking for your first camera, do yourself a favor and run cat5 with baluns, in case you want to go digital in the future.Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase.  It's exposed to the elements, so I don't know how long it will last.

These are noticeably better than the \"700 TV line\" Zmodo cameras that came with my security camera system.  This Evertech camera's color day light mode stays on longer after sunset and kicks in earlier in the morning. The camera angle is wider (about 90 degrees).  The night viewing mode is decent and able to see people (not faces) out to about 30 feet. The housing is metal and round, so it should be able to take more abuse.Be realistic and don't expect HD quality from this $43 camera.  The spec says 508 vertical lines. This means you can't read a license plate or clearly identify faces unless it is within 10 feet of the camera.  You will see people, pets, and cars but not in great detail when they are beyond 15 feet from the camera.  Night vision mode provides even less detail.My first camera has been operating for 4 months without any problems, so I bought more.My zmodo dvr records up to D1 resolution, which is 720Hx576V in PAL mode at best, so a better camera is just not justified.  Check the maximum resolution capability of your dvr before buying a better camera.  If you want better resolution spend more on IP cameras.Balancing price and function/construction, I don't think you can get a better deal.
