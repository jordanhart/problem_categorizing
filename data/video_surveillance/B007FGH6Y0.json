{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Handy House Cam", "Author": "B. Schwarzenbek", "ReviewID": "R20NME9OFFT0BW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The IP651WI is indeed a solid camera to own. It is well-built, looks nice, and records a very good picture on your computer. It is a bit bigger than I thought it would be and is a little noisy when panning the room, but all-in-all it was a good buy for my first IP camera setup.In terms of installation, if you intend to simply view your camera from your house (i.e. your home network), then the setup is a piece of cake. You connect the camera to your computer and follow the software CD prompts. At the end, they will ask you to click a link that brings you to the web-based display. Make sure you bookmark that link and write down the IP address (i.e. number before the :6500 in the URL). You also have the option of downloading the SecurView software, but that is mainly for multiple camera setups and more advanced options.Please note that the previous paragraph is ONLY for viewing the camera in your own network. If you try entering that same bookmark in your phone in 3G or anywhere away from your network, you won't get a live webpage. If your intention is to check in on your house when you are away, then do the following:Find the no-ip website using a search engine. It is a .com site. Sign up for a free account (I think they call it ManagedDNS currently) and pick whatever address you want. For example, you can take your own email user name and then have a no-ip .org designation after it. Doesn't matter what you choose. Why do you need to do this? Because your cable company doesn't use a fixed IP address. It changes and unless you want to change it manually every single time they change it, then you should do this. This address, called a Dynamic DNS, will now point to your home network IP no matter whether it changes or not.Now, if the Dynamic DNS is working correctly, you should be able to go into your phone's internet browser while on 3G and enter the same bookmarked camera link mentioned before, but instead of the IP address you had in the address before, replace it with your Dynamic DNS address (yes... it is okay that it doesn't look like an IP address). And make sure you don't erase the :6500 in the address either. Just the numbers before that. You now should be in business, BUT if you are not, then there is one more step to take.Log-in to your router and find the port forwarding area. If you don't know how to get into your router, ask Google using the model name and number. You could also ask Google about the .com site portforward. There you can find your router model and follow the directions. Once you are in, make sure that you are forwarding port 6500 (both TCP and UDP) from the original bookmarked IP address. Also make sure that IP address is static in the router. It will probably have a button that says \"reserve\" or something like that. Each router is different, so providing directions will be meaningless. In 99% of cases, you should be able to see your camera from anywhere now using the original bookmarked address with the DNS address instead of the IP. You can even download iPhone or Android apps (TrendNet's or other ones) to view your camera, rather than having to go through a web browser. The apps will just ask for your IP (use your DNS address), the port (6500), and your credentials. The other 1% of cases are usually software firewalls, router issues, the need to restart everything, etc.Good luck!!!", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Seems to work good after a lengthy set up", "Author": "Pankaj Patel \"Watchdog\"", "ReviewID": "R2NY9PYSDQX3J0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall camera is great but as other reviewers commented, set up can be painful and many hours wasted.Camera would not work in wireless mode.

I am an IT guy and so the idea of configuring ip addresses (even on a variable subnet for the Foscam pos...) was not intimidating to me.  That said, some of them are incredibly hard to set up or have a pretty poor image quality (again...talking about you Foscam).  The TRENDnet... very easy to set up - pretty much just worked.  Image quality is great once I realized that there is a manual focus ring.  You can turn off the bright LEDs which is nice and it has a 'privacy button'.  Also IR and color both are great quality.  Two small complaints - it drops the connection from time to time and has to be re-setup and the TRENDnet phone apps...pretty bad.  That said, if you are looking for an IP cam...I bought something like five trying them out....this was my favorite.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Read the Reviews", "Author": "Rick K.", "ReviewID": "R1025FPJBZJK0Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Read the reviews and educate yourself.  If you do and still go with it, you will be happy.  This is not a plug and play, but all those reviews that say, \"I'm an IT guy and can't figure it out.\"  Well, he's not an IT guy then.  I am not computer literate, and though it did take about an hour or two to set up 2 of them (one for the baby's room and another for his play room), it is very doable.  Just read up a little ahead of time, read these reviews and watch the [...] videos.  I had them up and running and even forwarding photos via FTP to a Network Attached Storage device.  The main thing is port forwarding your router.  Just look up a YouTube video for your specific router, as I did not have a Trendnet router, and that's really probably the hardest part.  And for as those that say the video quality is bad, probably didn't realize it has a manual focus on the lens that you have to adjust.  The focus is way off out of the box, but once you focus it, it's absolutely fine. Overall, being informed and knowing that it wasn't plug and play, I love them and am looking to purchase one or two more.", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice hardware but setup is painful!", "Author": "Historian", "ReviewID": "R16I8E61R598UW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After researching countless wireless IP cameras for home security, I decided on this one.  It has a nice combination of features at a fair price.  Ironically, the price of around $125 puts it into the \"consumer\" realm but the setup is anything but... you had better be a certified network engineer to get it connected to a mobile device outside of your home.The hardware features on this camera are pretty good.  Night mode works OK but I find it better to leave it in day mode, which is less distracted by glare and reflections if you are viewing through a window to the outside.  If you are viewing a pitch black room at night, then night mode is OK.  The audio is so crude that I leave it off.  The image quality is OK once you realize that this isn't a 12 megapixel camera.The software is rudimentary and the documentation that comes with it is cryptic.  As one other viewer reported, you will spend HOURS trying to get this device working and may not be successful.  My biggest problem was getting through my web browser security to view the video feed.  The documentation does not help with these issues.  I'm a serious and experienced computer user but I gave up trying to use Internet Explorer because I could not find the right ActiveX settings.  At first, Firefox would not work either until I enabled the Java add-on.  Unfortunately, when you do that, Firefox tells you that Java causes stability issues and leaves you wondering if you are doing the right thing.  So far, I haven't had any stability issues (I'm running Firefox 17).If you don't have WPS set up on your home router, then the setup instructions are painfully unclear about the sequence of steps needed.  You will have to run an Ethernet wire (included) from the camera to your router to get it on your network.  Once that is complete, you can cut the cord but, again, the documentation doesn't specify exactly when you can do that.If you want to view this device over the Internet and outside of your local network, like from your office or from your cell phone while traveling, then get HELP from someone who know what dynamic IP addresses are and what port forwarding is all about.  It took me a day and a half to work through this on my own, even though I'm very comfortable going into my router and changing security settings.  The latest TRENDnet cameras apparently do this configuration for you in their cloud, which sounds appealing.  Unfortunately with this model, you will need a subscription to a dynamic DNS service to connect it over the Internet.  This process involves programming BOTH the camera and your router with your new dynamic IP address and new port to make everything get through your firewall.  To further complicate matters, my Netgear wirelss N router would not support a free DNS service like no-ip.org so I had to buy an address from DynDNS.com.If this sounds Greek to you, then move on to another camera.I was eventually able to get this camera running through my iPad and iPhone from a remote location outside the house.  The Securview Pro app is not the best but it will let you view the video feed, listen to audio (very scratchy) and move the camera position.  The laptop version of the software allows you to setup video recording of multiple cameras but the software is so awful, I removed it from my computer.  You can configure the camera through your web browser to send you an email photo at regular intervals or set it to detect motion and then send you photos.  Be careful with this setting as you may find 50 emails in your inbox if the sensitivity is too high or the motion is constant.I'm just not sure it was worth the two days it took to figure this camera out, not to mention the worries of messing up my router and fears of making my browser more vulnerable to virus attacks.  Right now, its a curiosity piece around the house that hasn't brought peace of mind.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works great!

There are a few other points worth mentioning though:* Video quality was good.  Note though that you need to manually adjust the focus ring.  If you have a blurry picture out of the box, try adjusting the focus.* Pan and tilt speed was good as long as the signal was good, and the camera was easy to control.  The mechanism also feels smooth.  I've had Foscam cameras in the past, and their pan and tilt always seemed slower and jerkier.* The Foscam cameras I've had in the past had really flaky firmwares.  While I haven't had the TRENDnet long enough to say, it definitely seems like a more solid device.* The zoom appears to just be a digital zoom, so don't expect to zoom in to see extra detail.  At this price point though, that's expected.* Setup was a slight pain.  It didn't want to connect with WPS to the Linksys router I have, and if I connected it via a wired connection, the camera setup program on my laptop wouldn't find it when my laptop was connected wirelessly.

I found that Internet Explorer was better to use to navigate the camera options. The included manual was a little sparse on directions, but the installation CD had the instructions needed to setup. The webcam is approx 50ft from the router but the signal is sufficient, but I would first set it next to the router, then move into position as per the instructions.
