I wanted to have the installation done quickly so went on Amazon the same day and located the PKALL Encrypted Key Data Transponder Bypass Kit. It had excellent reviews so I ordered it with one day shipping. Got the unit the next day and had the alarm system installed. The bypass kit connects directly to the brain of the Python alarm system as well as the brain of all the major brands, so no special connections were needed. Since the installation, my vehicle starts, on queue, every time I press the remote start button on my alarm system's remote. Once started, I am able to drive off without shutting off the car and restarting with the key, just by putting the key into the ignition and turning it to the start position. It works so well that the company that installed my alarm, uses the PKALL bypass kit for most installations and recommends it to their customers. This is an excellent product and I highly recommend it.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Annoying programming", "Author": "Balien", "ReviewID": "R2N8GP4HN72TFA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Make sure you get the printout for your specific vehicle directly from their website it will show you your vehicle only. the instructions it comes with are less detailed although they do cover all vehicles. The pkall is supposed to flash 10 times when programmed and mine either didn't or did it so fast I didn't see it while i was putting the key in the ignition. I ended up wasting 3 hours ringing out wires, checking connections and reprogramming because it wouldn't flash. After all that I found out it was working. The programming sucks you have to hold a button while hooking up all the connectors hidden up in the dash. Given all that it works perfectly with no wasted key.

These vehicle specific instructions showed the pinouts, but, not the wire colors connected to the connector. After installing in my Ford Ranger with an experienced installer that used to own a Ziebart where they installed tons of remote starts we could not figure out why the bypass would not program. The next day after installing I ran some tests with with my DMM and determined that the diagram showed the connector upside down of how it was actually mounted in the vehicle. I rewired the connection opposite of our first try and it programmed. Works great after a correct install/program, but, as others have posted, there is no customer service for DIY installers. The phone number was useless and the websites are for dealers only. The only thing I did find indirectly online for anyone seeking help is a directed(mfg of xpresskit) knowledge base (google it/your problem) it showed some known problems/solutions in a q&a; type setup where administrators would give a possible solution.
