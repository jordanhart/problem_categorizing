This is necessary to eliminate the tiny PC-formatted boot partition on this drive that will confuse your Mac upon start-up.

The drive I received arrived well packaged and in excellent condition.  I decided that before I open the static guard protection bag that I would register the drive on Western Digital's website.  To my surprise, WD would only cover the supposed 5 yr warranty for 17 months.  Their explanation is that the drive was sold as a \"REPLACEMENT\" drive for another customer and that the warranty would not be covered for the full 5 years.  I brought this to the attention of the reseller and they told me the drive only had a 90 day warranty but he would be willing to cover the drive for three years. I told him that what I purchased was a NEW drive that is advertised with a 5 year warranty and that's not what I was sold.  I demanded my money back in full and a call ticket to return the product.  After a brief negotiation, that resulted in my agreeing to keep them nameless in any reviews, they agreed and waived the 20% restocking fee and paid to have the drive returned.To make a long story short, if you're not purchasing direct from Amazon, look elsewhere.

Moncure", "ReviewID": "R39H320IPGFAIW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just purchased this WD 500GB Enterprise HDD from Amazon, and had it delivered Amazon Prime. Out of the box, the drive worked excellent and after a full format the drive is serving excellent as a secondary storage drive, running next to my 64GB SSD.Windows 7 64, my motherboard, and my PC had no problems identifying the drive. Like any new HDD install, I had to go into the disk management menu and create a new partition / drive. After that I started transferring my media collection and downloads that I don't run from boot (or on an everyday basis) to the new drive.As a secondary drive this product should be excellent. So far it effortlessly streams my 1080p media and provides me fast and accessible storage for my extensive photo and music collection. Having 64MB in cache, as I understand it, allows the HDD controller to grab information before it's needed based on past actions. Assume you're streaming a high-bitrate video - the extra cache allows the HDD controller to grab and then store or \"cache\" the information that will be needed before it's needed by the video program you are running. I am sure this explanation is rather simple, and certainly the amount of cache is probably overkill for what I do - watching media and running typical Win7 programs - but it's nice to have.Certainly the strongest benefit of owning this drive is its \"Enterprise\" classification. What this means is that you have business-grade or enterprise-class quality and a five year warranty. While others say that this drive is not for standalone, single-drive (non-RAID) configuration, I don't see anything anywhere that indicates it cannot be used for this or does not perform perfectly as a standard workstation drive in a single-drive-access configuration.It's as easy as plug-and-play should be to get this drive going - and the comfort of a five year warranty is a big plus. The 7200 rpm access speeds are perfectly adequate for my needs, and the SATA 3GB/s standard is probably much faster than the actual read/write speeds you'll get with the drive. What I'm saying is that the drive exceeds the standard by its SATA interface, but the actual drive data exchange between the PC and the drive will probably never reach that 3GB/s in normal everyday use. In other words, over-engineering is not overkill but a strong benefit!I anticipate minimal problems with this drive - I have had much success with the WD Green series of 5400 rpm drives in the past. Also all I get from my Lian-Li PC-A04 case is a quiet hum when it's running - pretty quiet considering it is a magnetic drive.In short I see no negatives other than the price premium - which really is offset by the following benefits:1) Five year warranty by directly registering the product with WD.2) SATA 3GB/s interface3) 7200 RPM4) WD reputation for quality5) Enterprise-quality build6) 64MB in cache7) immediate visibility and seamless install in Windows environment", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Weapon of choice for whitebox RAID deployments.", "Author": "Joshua G.

In big RAID systems you must use hard drives manufactured to support RAID operation, particularly in regard to error recovery timing.  Desktop hard drives take a long time to perform error recovery - which causes problems in RAID systems leading to data corruption and premature flagging of a drive as bad.  These WD RE4 drives use a feature called \"Time Limited Error Recovery\" to prevent a drive in error recovery from being dropped by the array.  Supposedly enterprise drives are built more vibration tolerant to handle the stresses of being operated in a drive shelf.In any case, over the past year one of the Vtrak shelves loaded with 16 RE4 drives behaved flawlessly and the other one lost 4 drives in a single episode over a 48 hour period about 6 months into deployment.  My experience is, thus, mixed.  However the price per spindle is dramatically better than using branded drives from HP, Dell, or the other major storage vendors.  My advice is to use RAID 6 and designate 2 hot spares per shelf.Other than this single episode with 4 drives dying in short temporal proximity, these drives have been fine.  Their performance is good.  In the large array they provide large storage at a decent price with acceptable performance.  Prices have risen dramatically because WD's Thailand operation was damaged by the Fall 2011 flooding in Thailand.  Prices will probably go up further until production levels are restored sometime in mid 2012 or so.UPDATE - after the subsequent review warned about getting a pulled drive I looked at my last one (purchased 12/11/11).

AND another RMA and the replacement lasted two months and a day later one of the other drives failed. You know it takes about a week for the drive to get to WD, then they fool around with it for a couple of days, then send a replacement 3 day air, so about two weeks a drive. Something like 60% fail rate? The big money for five drives and a backplane and time spent setting up this RAID only to have a system that is NOT reliable at all. By the way, the backplane was taken out of the loop and drives connected direct to motherboard for troubleshooting, SATA and power cables also switched out and checked. A good indicator is when drives sound like someone clearing their throat.Conclusion: THIS is ridiculous.

Last week, one of the drives failed, but thankfully I had the RAID 5 which falls back to RAID 0 in this situation. I didn't want to just replace the 1 drive, since they were all getting old, but I couldn't afford to purchase multiple drives for a new RAID setup.  The \"new\" RE4 500GB wasn't sold by Amazon. I'd have to pay extra shipping and I wasn't sure how fast it would get here. So, I settled on this WD RE4 500GB (\"used-like new\") from Amazon Warehouse Deals because my Prime membership never lets me down.The disk arrived in 2 days, as promised, in a plain brown WD box--but much to my surprise it wasn't wrapped in a static guard bag and the drive itself had been marked with a permanent black marker with the number \"1\". And, the manufacture date on it was 6 months old. Hmmm... this doesn't look good--not exactly \"like new\". I downloaded and ran the Western Digital Data LifeGuard Diagnostics test and it passed. I then went to wdc.com to register it. After plugging in the serial number it said \"Limited Warranty\" with 4.5 yrs left (based on the manufacture date). I was afraid of that. But I decided to complete the registration and when I entered the purchase date, it changed the warranty to 5yrs + 1 month (61 months). Sweet! I did a final backup that night of the old RAID OS volume and restored it to the new drive the next morning using Acronis True Image.  I did this instead of \"cloning\" because it can be done within Windows 7--recreating the active/running OS partition--without interacting with it. The restore to the new disk took less than an hour. I adjusted the BIOS settings for the new OS disk and it booted right up. Flawless.The take-home message #1 is: if it's essential to your livelihood, you need redundancy like a RAID 5 or a mirror setup AND a backup system (mine is Acronis True Image setup to backup every night). Now, I feel a little insecure because I don't have the redundancy anymore which means I could lose whatever work I do since the previous evening should the new drive fail. But, I think the RE4 disk is still a good choice if you're using a single disk. I will probably get 1 more when money isn't quite so tight and at least have a mirror.The take-home message #2 is: Don't jump to conclusions. Things aren't always as bad as they might appear. You can still get the full 5 yrs from WD buying from Amazon Warehouse Deals and their packaging is just that: packaging. It might not look good, but it's how the product performs that matters. I got it fast, saved a few bucks, got the full 5 yrs and it works great. I would buy another \"like new\" drive without hesitation.", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "E.

They are running on a 3Ware 9640SE raid card fine.  In my case, they run about 91 degrees F, your results will vary obviously depending on your case set up.  These are a tad noisier than the previous drives, but not enough to be a concern, hard to hear them over the case fans which are not super quiet on my system.All the drives ran when I received them, no DOAs but 1 did fail the WD drive tool test.  I contacted Amazon and was cross shipped a replacement at no cost, received in 2 days.  This is one very good reason to buy drives from Amazon vs other online computer hardware companies which will charge shipping for replacements.  I highly recommend using the WD drives tool on any WD disk you buy prior to setting up on your system.  Use the short and long test.  My drive passed the short test but failed the long test.If you are upsizing an array that will auto rebuild, just replace 1 at a time letting it rebuild before replacing the next drive.  This worked great for the RAID 5 drive on the MB ICH10R.  Using the Intel Raid Management tool (free download) I resized without losing any data after all 4 drives were in place.  The RAID10 on the 3Ware card would not upsize using 3DM2 tool so I contacted LSI who wrote a script to upsize the array.  Ran the script as directed but it only upsized half the array, so it became corrupt and I lost the array.  Fortunately I had just made a System Image on a single disc (2TB WD Red) and was able to quickly restore the image using the Windows 7 disk.  If you have a RAID card, there's a pretty good chance the Win7 installation will not have the RAID drivers included, so make sure you have those available on a USB or floppy before getting into a position that might require you to restore an image after losing an array.", "Date": "February 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "WD RE4 500 GB Enterprise Hard Drive", "Author": "R.

Normal lifespan of mechanical hard drives is 5 years. I've had quite a few 640 GB drives fail after only a year or two of normal use, no RAID, and suggested maintenance like periodic defragmentation.

I never use a drive larger than 250 GB for the primary OS boot drive. Monitoring the drive's health from time to time using a free software program like CrystaldiskInfo seems to support my theory.

Yes, shame on me for not reading the fine print (the information was NOT in the title when I purchased these), but who in the *%&$# is still selling Sata II drives these days?!  That should not be something I need to pay attention to, especially when the EXACT SAME RE4 SATA III DRIVE IS THE SAME PRICE.  So... DO *NOT* BUY THESE DRIVES.  Buy the faster SATA III for the EXACT SAME PRICE.I'm pretty ticked off.  I was sent a resold drive that has NO WARRANTY.It annoys the heck out of me when I order from Amazon, using the same link, but I get two different products (from two different vendors, especially when one of the products is from a SHADY VENDOR SELLING ITEMS THEY SHOULDN'T BE SELLING).Two weeks ago I ordered a 2TB WD enterprise RE4 disk from Amazon.  It was shipped by SERVERTECH INC and the model number on the drive is WD2003FYYS-02W0B1 (this is a valid product with a proper warranty).Two weeks later I ordered the EXACT same drive from the EXACT same link, but it was shipped by Aeon Micro, Inc., and the model number is WD2003FYYS-18W0B0.Not only did the second drive have a different model number, but it DOES NOT have a Western Digital label.  Instead, the label looks more generic and states \"Enterprise class certified by Dell.\"  When I entered the serial number to register on the WD site, the information showed that this drive is a NO WARRANTY drive.  The exact wording from the WD site is: \"Product was originally sold to a system manufacturer. Please contact the system manufacturer or the place of purchase for warranty service.\" I'm ticked off to say the least.I am still giving four stars because these drives are solid and amazing and I believe these reviews should be about the product, not Amazon's failures, but hopefully Amazon works harder to provide the same item instead of switching vendors for the same link every two weeks or so.  If I am given ANY flack about returning this drive to receive a PROPER one, I am going to be REALLY angry.  I will already be out the time taken to ship (and now ship back and receive a new one), not to mention the effort to repackage, go to the shipping facility, and ship the drive back to Amazon.ALWAYS GO TO THE MANUFACTURER'S SITE TO REGISTER YOUR DRIVES IMMEDIATELY UPON RECEIVING THEM. This is the quickest and easiest way to find out if you have been sold a legitimate drive (I wasn't).***UPDATE: It should be noted that Aeon Micro was extremely quick (less than 12 hours) to remedy the situation.  I was sent an RMA and postage paid shipping label, and they actually over-nighted a brand new drive (manufactured in March of this year) with the appropriate WD label even before I returned the drive that had been manufactured for Dell builds and resale.  I'm still not sure why Aeon would ship out drives sold specifically as \"system build\" drives for Dell (and thus carrying NO warranty from the manufacturer), especially as fulfillment from an Amazon link showing original WD-labeled OEM drives, but they were quick to remedy the problem ONCE I POINTED IT OUT.  I'm not sure every consumer knows to check their drive on the manufacturer's website upon receiving (I only knew because I had read about a similar problem in another Amazon review).

I bought the 1TB version for about $110, which I think is a pretty good value considering the drive's five-year warranty and performance ambitions.  If you're looking for negatives, the only one I can come up with is noise.  Most drives today are nearly silent--this one is not.

When the drives arrived, one was working and the other one had numerous bad sector errors (according to WD's drive evaluation DOS utility). Both had been well-packed for shipment: each OEM drive was packed in foam in it's own box, and then each of those boxes were surrounded by bubble-wrap and then packed in another carton. Since these were supposed to have been ultra-reliable \"enterprise-class\" drives, a failure rate of 50% wasn't what I had expected. RMAed both of the drives and instead bought two WD1002FBYS RE3 1 TB 32-meg cache drives. The RE3 drives have been working fine since installed.On a more positive note, when tested against my 3-year old Hitachi HDP7250GLA 500 GB drives with a 16-meg cache, the WD2003FYYS drives (in a Raid 1 configuration on my system) had a 90% faster average access time (19.8 for the Hitachi HDP7250GLA vs. 10.4 for the WD2003FYYS).  Most of that difference likely due to the 16-meg vs. 64-meg disk cache -- along with improvements in hard drive technology over a period of 3 years. Comparing the RE4 WD2003FYYS to the RE3 WD1002FBYS drives, the WD1002FBYS drives' average access time is about 18% slower -- although still 56% faster than the two older-model Hitachi's that they replaced.", "Date": "August 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "High Performance , High Quality", "Author": "PoultryLogistics", "ReviewID": "R1R9MD0U62Q32S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "29 June, 2011Having hovered on the fringes of 3D CAD long enough, I recently purchased a used Dell Precision T5400 workstation (Xeon quad core 3.16 Ghz, 4GB RAM, 1TB Hitachi, Quadro FX570 video card) to get the best performance I could using AutoCad Revit 2011 and Inventor Pro 2011- both very demanding 3D CAD programs.  I upgraded the T5400 to 12GB RAM, and from Vista Business 64-bit to Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit, and today I'm adding an NVidia geforce GTX 285 1GB that will configured to emulate a Quadro 5800 CAD oriented card- (and thereby saving about $3,000 on the card). Because I'm not very disciplined with backup and always worried about HD failure- though I've only had 2 failures in 18 years, I decided to set up- eventually -a RAID 1 that would have a pair of HD's that continually mirror each other.Having had good luck with Western Digital drives and read many HD reviews, I chose a Western Digital RE4, 500GB. Another contender was the single platter Samsung 500GB which is also very fast. Early on during research, I was planning to buy a pair of WD Caviar Black 1TB, but WD has arranged that only the Enterprise series can be configured for RAID- some sort of error correction is not present in their other series, so an RE4 it was.  Instead of having to learn how to set up the RAID, for the time being, I decided to take the 1TB Hitachi out of the T5400, mount it in a USB HD enclosure (Sabrent eSATA to SATA aluminum) and for now this external drive would become the backup drive. The external drive will only run when backing up and I'm hoping that will extend it's life substantially.  By the way, the Sabrent aluminum enclosure is brilliant- very nicely made and has a extremely quiet fan which keeps it very cool. The blue lights give it a serious, almost military hardware quality.The Precision T5400 has a wonderfully convenient HD carrier assembly that unclips and swings out and the drives are held in caddies that can be unclipped and draw vertically from the carrier. It's possible to change drives in less than 5 minutes. Having had a disaster while using Paragon Suite 10- during which the 1-year old WD 750BG disk from my XP machine (Dell Dimension 8400) became a door stop, I set the RE4 in the second drive caddy on SATA 1 and cloned the Hitachi (on SATA 0)to the RE4 using Easus ToDo 2.5 which is a free version, and excellent- you can be cloning in minutes. I recommend that anyone contemplating an HD upgrade spend an equal effort in carefully choosing utilities- the software I bought ruined a HD and created many hours of frustration, while the free product sailed through.  When cloning the partitions from the Hitachi to the RE4, the transfer ran initially at 3.87GB/min and at the end, at 3.2GB/sec. In all it copied about 120GB in four partitions in about 29 minutes. I used the Easus to copy a backup of C: to another HD partition in a Dell Optiplex 740 (Athlon 64 dual core 2.4Ghz, Hitachi 500GB) and the transfer rate was about 2.4GB/min- still seeming quite fast.  The 64MB cache of the RE4 is something that improves read/write rates, and that may be a lot of the difference- it really works. Checking at the end of the cloning session, the RE4 was running at 89F and the Hitachi in the enclosure at 110F.  At the moment, the RE4 is at 82F- only 10 degrees above the room.  I was surprised that with the RE4 my Windows Experience index for the T5400 disk remained the same at 5.9, as the startup, application speeds, and transfer times seemed very much improved.The RE4 is very quiet- and the T5400 has a heavy case and cover that probably assists this, and it seems to me to have less vibration than any drive I've had. Looking at it physically, it seems more substantially made, and I can see that the base of the platter spindle is large diameter.  WD touts this extra rotational stability as a reason they can offer a 5- year warranty- and it must be effective. If you are using CAD, a good video card is essential in combination with fast read/write drive speeds. And, if you're on a budget as I am, consider high end gaming cards that use the same GPU as CAD-oriented cards. There are several NVidia geforce cards that can act as extremely expensive Quadros. Wikipedia has a fantastically useful table of quadro cards with notes on which geforce uses the same GPU. You can use a utility to simply rename the card as the CAD version and using the CAD drivers, save, save, save while having very high CAD performance. That's how the GTX285 can emulate a Quadro 5800 costing 10 times as much (note: the 285 is 1GB and the 5800 4GB).  If you use Autodesk products, you can download optimized drivers for their recommended cards. Gaming cards concentrate on fast frame rates- abbreviating shading and rendering while CAD cards shade and render every frame fully. In these applications the combination of fast disk and fast video can transform the 3D CAD use.  Newer software is increasingly taking advantage of multiple cores as well- if you have AutoCad 2007 or newer, type WHIPTHREAD in the command line, choose one of three configurations, and it will optimize core threading.A word about HD size: When contemplating my needs for HD space, I determined that all the files I've created since 1993- excluding many GB's of audio files on my recording computer (HP Elite quad core 3Ghz Q6600, 8GB RAM)- is only about 25GB and that includes 9,000 documents, 600 AutoCad drawings, and 11,000 images. When I set up the Hitachi drive- which was a 1TB,  I created a 100GB partition for the OS and Programs, 100Gb for active files, 100GB for archive files, and the remaining 700GB for a backup copy of C:. Adding it up- 45GB in C:, 22 in D:, 18 in F: and 45 in G:, at this rate I could theoretically use something like a 160GB drive with room for 10 more years of work.  Message- have a look at your real storage needs.  Also, consider a reasonably compact partition for the OS/programs- because the tracking arms then have a shorter distance to travel, the access time is noticeably reduced and of course, partitions are virus resistant.  With the RE4 \"short-shifted\" in this way, except for the huge 3D applications, starting applications like WordPerfect X4 and Corel Photopaint is more like \"snapping\" them on- they just appear instantly. I changed the video card in the Optiplex 740 from onboard shared 1GB ATI Radeon 6150LE to a Quadro FX 570 (256MB) and the Windows Index for gaming graphics went from 3.7 to 4.9 and the important for me graphics index from 3.0 to 4.6- a 60% percent improvement. By the way, over the years, Dell computers seem to have a consistently high synergy with NVidia cards.Overall, the Western Digital RE4 500GB, is a very satisfying product that seems a good step above in quality and performs better than any drive I've had. 3D CAD is very read/write intensive and the 64MB cache of the RE4 is surely helping- and can properly support the speeds of a high performance video card.  The RE4 may be the beautiful swan song of mechanical HD's- and my last mechanical HD purchase. When 320GB SSD's are $100,...Summary: The extra cost for the RE4 is one of the best uses for $20 I can think of! Consider carefull, disk utility software, using compact OS/application partitions, and a video card that in combination can utilize the capabilities of the RE4.  Amazon as usual did very well, and the RE4 was sent in a fitted box with formed plastic end holders.Cheers,PoultryLogistics", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "As Advertised", "Author": "J. T.
