{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Beware of a hardware problem introduced on newer Foscam cameras", "Author": "J Den", "ReviewID": "R30GQV3F3C8KGX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Summary: Foscam is manufacturing and selling cameras with a known manufacturing defect. If the camera is pointed at a scene with too much detail (trees, grass, wood grain, window screen, etc) the camera will fail by either freezing, displaying black or rebooting. This defect was introduced as the result of a sensor change in December 2012. It was first reported by users to Foscam in May of 2013. Foscam publicly confirmed this manufacturing defect as the DSP in December 2013 and they also put a repair procedure in place. This procedure involves shipping the newly purchased camera to a distributor in Texas for repair. I've personally sent two cameras in for repair; the first repair took 15 days and required a significant amount of effort to process including a BBB complaint. The second repair took 18 days to turn around and was processed easily. Oddly, the serial number of this second camera changed before/after the repair so they seem to have sent a different camera instead of repairing. Regardless, the camera now works. Other users have reported varying amounts of friction when attempting to process these repairs.This DSP problem is widespread among Foscam cameras. Many users potentially have cameras with the defect but do not observe the effects because the camera is not pointed at a scene with enough detail to trigger the fault. Other users may observe the defect but incorrectly identify the problem as cabling or other networking gear. At last check, 423 faulty cameras have been reported in the Foscam forums. These forums detail this defect extensively, and also offer a DIY solution for users brave enough to open the camera up and fab a custom USB cable to interface with the DSP. This forum thread can be found by doing a web search for \"MJPEG Cameras hanging rebooting based on image data.\" The defect is reproduced by many users with a variety of Foscam models.A review has been posted to each of these confirmed models. This includes Foscam models 8904, 8905, 8906, 8910, 8916, and 8919. However, be aware that the defect may exist on additional models as well. Amazon is aware of these details being documented on multiple reviews for different models. Please see the update at the bottom of this review for more information regarding this.Foscam currently claims that all cameras purchased from specific retailers as of November 2013 have the issue 100% resolved. Unfortunately, the forums show 111 faulty cameras reported from 11/1 through 12/10. To be fair, some users have reported purchasing non-faulty cameras and hopefully this will continue. But other users (as of February 2014) continue to report new cameras from these specific retailers with the defect. Unfortunately, purchasing a Foscam camera continues to be a gamble.There is a relatively simple way to verify if a specific camera has the DSP bug. The Foscam web GUI has the option to capture a snapshot. Faulty cameras that have the DSP bug are not able to capture a snapshot greater than ~60K. If a camera is able to capture a snapshot above this threshold then it does not have the bug. If the snapshot is smaller than 60K then the current scene does not have enough detail to verify if the bug is present. The camera will need to be pointed at a more complex scene and tested again until a snapshot greater than ~60K is achieved or failure is observed. Faulty cameras that have been repaired by Foscam can also capture above the ~60K threshold.I do not recommend buying this camera, or any other Foscam MJPEG camera unless you want to gamble with this known and confirmed freezing/black/rebooting problem. Based on the quality of support I recommend staying away from all Foscam cameras in general. They are inexpensive, but your time and sanity are worth a far greater value.:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Foscam posted a response to this review. If you are seeking additional information, my comments on the response are below::::Foscam US, thank you for the response. I have been close to this issue since the defect was first brought to Foscam's attention in May and this is the first public acknowledgement that I am aware of. Previously this had only been acknowledged privately through email/phone. As there are currently 62,997 views on this topic in the Foscam forums and over 400 reported faulty cameras I'm glad that there is now an \"official\" acknowledgement of this defect.I do contend with some of the statements you provided as these statements do not match the current experience from actual users.----------------------------------Foscam US - \"all cameras currently sold by Foscam US through the Foscam US website as well as through Amazon.com direct and the Amazon store \"Foscam Digital Technologies LLC\" have the issue 100% resolved as of November 2013\"----------------------------------This is simply not true. Users continue to report faulty cameras from these sources. It is also worth noting that several times over the last 7 months Foscam support told users (privately over email/phone) that the defect has been fixed and newly purchased cameras will function correctly. Regardless of these statements by Foscam, users continue to report defects. Data from 11/01 through 12/10 shows that 111 additional faulty cameras have been reported since November 1. Time may show otherwise, I hope it does, but currently this statement is simply not true.----------------------------------Foscam US - \"Furthermore, Foscam US (not the manufacturer which is Foscam China) is willing to replace any cameras free of charge (shipping cost covered both ways) which are suffering from this defect\"----------------------------------This is also simply not true (unless this policy very recently changed). I have 50+ emails back and forth with Foscam support detailing exactly how difficult it is to process the repair. My experience was not unique, as other users have reported similar experiences. Since 8/23 there have been 7 BBB complaints; overall the BBB gives Foscam a D rating. However, if these policies have recently changed then I applaud the decision to reverse Foscam's previous policy. (Amazon Review Update: Credit where credit is due, my second repair was processed smoothly so this process may indeed be getting easier)Bottom Line:1) Foscam's response claims that cameras sold from specific retailers have the issue resolved as of November 2013. This is simply not true based on consumer reports.2) The response also claims that Foscam US will replace faulty cameras free of charge. If that is true, then that is a change in policy and a step in the right direction. However, many users outside of the US are also reporting faulty cameras. Unless the manufacturer (not simply a US distributor) steps up to repair the cameras, then these international users are still without a repair solution for their faulty cameras. Foscam the manufacturer needs to assist users in correcting this defect.--The referenced data and user experiences above are detailed in the Foscam forums and from the BBB.--::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Update Regarding Multiple Reviews ::::On 2/17 a version of this review was pulled-down from the Foscam 8919 listing. I asked Amazon to review the removal. Amazon performed a review (Megan, Kath and Kai specifically) and relisted the review unmodified on 2/20. In an effort to preempt any future problems I have modified some reviews for other affected Foscam models to point to the full details on this review. However, to be clear, Amazon approved the relisting as-is. Thank you to Amazon for taking the time to have humans evaluate this review in the context of my other reviews and to relist. It is always good to see a system/process that works as intended.", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Features for the Price", "Author": "R. Tickle \"RATickle\"", "ReviewID": "R3M2OVTPNBM4HQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Considering that you are paying less than $100 for a wireless IP Camera that provides PT (no Zoom), infrared night vision, motion detection, and automatic email of alarm photos, there is very little one can criticize about this camera.  Yes, it's tricky to set-up if you have never done port-forwarding before and yes, the frame rate and resolution are both a little low, and the audio is crap, but remember that you paid less than $100 for this thing.  If you need audio, higher frame rates and better resolution, you should buy a more expensive IP camera.As far as setup goes, if you understand networking and port-forwarding, these are my recommendations:1) Do NOT install the software on the CD.2) Connect the camera by Cat-5 wire to your router.3) Login to your router (via browser) and find the IP address assigned to your camera.4) Login to the camera at that IP address (via browser) and IMMEDIATELY turn OFF the DHCP.5) Give your camera a fixed IP address on your network and fill in the subnet mask with what you normally use.6) The Gateway and DNS fields should normally be the IP address of your router.7) Fill in the SSID, encryption type, and share key used by your wireless network.8) Pick a 4 digit number to use for the HTTP port number.  (I have no idea what \"Network Lamp\" is so I left it checked.)9) Disconnect the Cat-5 cable and re-boot the camera.10) Re-login to the camera at the new fixed IP address to verify that everything's working.11) Login to your router and set a port-forwarding entry to map to the fixed IP address and HTTP port you gave your camera.12) Use the \"What's My IP\" site to find your outside IP address.13) Enter your outside IP address and HTTP port number into a browser and verify that you can get into the camera from outside your house.14) You're done.UPDATE #1:Under the Mail Service Settings there is a checkbox named \"Report Internet IP by Mail\".  If you check this, when you ISP gives you a new external IP address or when the camera reboots because of a power failure, the camera will email you the current external IP address and port!  A very nice feature for those of us who prefer not to use DDNS services.UPDATE #2:The best app I've found for viewing IP camera feeds on a smartphone or tablet is IP Cam Viewer by Robert Chou.UPDATE #3:While I am still pleased with my FosCams, two things have happened recently that make me wonder about the business practices of FosCam.  First, out of the blue they have raised the price $10.  Second, FosCam.us is given me the run-around about an RMA to return a camera I purchased directly from FosCam.  If you do decide to purchase a FosCam camera, buy it through Amazon.  Amazon will not give you the run-around over a return.  FosCam seems to be money-grubbing and anti-customer.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great inexpensive security cam", "Author": "Roger H Gray", "ReviewID": "RC7S8V0GCHED2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Foscam F18910W camera is operating quite well.  I have 3 F18918W cameras and have been pleased with their operation and function as well.  They are very stable cameras - images always available whenever I link to them- and easy to set up.For setup, I have found it easier to just plug them in using the Ethernet connection, and then log into my router and find their IP address, and set them up from there.  The only thing you have to remember during setup is that the new camera's port may be set the same as an existing camera.  In this case either shut down any existing cameras, or use the FosCam install software and let it find the new camera and port number.I have the FosCams mounted in our business for security and their range of motion and quality of images- including infrared- has been invaluable. Also the sound quality is good from the camera. Talking through the cameras to someone is weak, but there. I am replacing older D-Link DCS-900 cameras which are fixed position only provide picture- no sound or two-way communication capabilities.One feature that would be good in my case would be the ability to zoom in on an object.  Zoom is not a function of any of the FosCam models I now have.I monitor the cameras from my IPad, my Droid 2 and 3 phones using an excellent app - IP Cam Viewer from Robert Chou. I also use IE and Chrome browsers.You do have to use port forwarding on your router so you can find the cameras via your business/home location's IP address. If you don't have a static IP address, you can use dyndns.org to track your dynamic IP address.", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Value Wireless IP Camera", "Author": "Amazonian 2082 \"Amazonian 2082\"", "ReviewID": "R3VFZSXX7JKSQW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Summary:This camera, and the company itself, clearly has some shortcomings.  However, at this price you'll be content, if not ecstatic.  It works well as a security camera and baby monitor.  After using it for 1 week I've bought 2 more.  Details below.Research:After researching Wireless IP cameras for a few hours I concluded that this camera is the best value.  I compared it to all other wireless IP cameras including TrendNet TRENDnet TV-IP422WN SecurView Wireless Day/Night Pan/Tilt/Zoom Internet Surveillance Camera Logitech Logitech Alert 750e Outdoor Master Security System with Night Vision Foscam 8918 Foscam FI8918W Wireless/Wired Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with 8 Meter Night Vision and 3.6mm Lens (67\u00b0 Viewing Angle) and the high end ones Panasonic Panasonic BB-HCM531A Outdoor Pan/Tilt PoE Security Network Camera (Silver) and this amazing one from Axis Axis 214 Ptz Network Camera Pan Tilt Zoom Day/night 2 Way Audio.  Not to mention this camera is light years ahead of a TrendNet camera I bought a few years ago for the same price (Newer Model) TRENDnet ProView Wireless Internet Surveillance Camera TV-IP501W (White).Setup: I couldn't find the software available for download on Foscam's website so I actually had to use the CD (People still use CD's?).  Once I installed the software, I hard wired the camera to my router Linksys E2500 Advanced Simultaneous Dual-Band Wireless-N Router, opened up the software, read the manual, typed in the default use id and password, read the manual again, played with all the setting and then set it up to connect wirelessly.  Then I closed the software, unplugged the camera from the router, unplugged the power to the camera, plugged the power back in, opened the software back up and everything worked fine.Pros:The rotation works great.  If you set the speed to 0 it moves fast.At far distances, the lens itself is decent enough to get more than just general idea of what is going on.  At close distances it's sufficient.Works great with the iPad.According to my Kill A WATT P3 International P4400 Kill A Watt Electricity Usage Monitor it only uses 3 watts.Camera Cons:Either the quality control is off or something got mixed up because I ordered this camera in white and it came with a nice multifunctional mounting bracket.  However, I ordered the silver/black version of this camera and it came with 2 antennas, but no mounting bracket.  I contacted Foscam about this.  They apologized, didn't question me, and sent me a mounting bracket for free.The body of the camera fees a bit cheap, which maybe it is. For example, the top half of the camera does not fit snugly into the base.  However, I have not had any problems rotating it.The edge of the picture has a slight bow to it.The resolution is not HD.  You couldn't make out a license plate from more than 20 feet away if that.While transferring a large file wirelessly from one laptop to another using my E2500 router, the camera would pan erratically.  As soon as the file transfer stopped the camera worked fine.I couldn't get the speakers to work even with a microphone NADY SP-4C Dynamic Microphone plugged directly into the unit or into my computer.  (Not sure what to do here.)I couldn't get it to play/record any sound either.  To improvise I bought a baby monitor NTM-910YLW - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor.Runs hot, but it hasn't affected its performance and again it's only using 3 watts.Supposedly you can't use this outside.  I may test that theory.  If I do I'll let you know.Software Cons:You can't change the size of the camera view.You can't digitally zoom in on one spot.If the alarm triggers it records for 1 minute.  The only thing you can adjust is the sensitivity.You can't adjust screen size, which is really annoying when you use the multiple camera view because the screen size of each camera is tiny.Tips:If you have multiple monitors, double click on the picture and it will open up a full screen view on one of your other monitors.  This is especially helpful if you're using the multiple camera view because the picture is small.Camera Suggestions:The company details the limitations of the camera, but you don't realize how nice it would be to have some features until you use it.This camera should be able to turn 360 degrees instead of just 270.  It's quite annoying to not be able to see behind the camera.Software Suggestions:The alarm settings need to be much more adjustable.The screen size needs to be adjustable.You need to be able to click on an area of the screen and zoom in.Anyone else have a sneaky suspicion that someone in (guess where?) is looking at what I'm looking at?  Maybe that's why they're so cheap?If you figured out how to get the sound working or have a solution to any of the other problems leave me a comment!UPDATE 1:I was able to get the sound and microphone working.  I had to add the camera's IP address to my trusted sites.  The manufacturers website has a forum with answers to questions like this.UPDATE 2:I have 4 cameras total.  2 black, 1 white and 1 silver.  The silver model appears to have some problems.  I have a tripod that will easily screw into all but the silver one.  Also, after about a month of use the IR filter will not turn off on the silver one so the green grass looks like a purplish gray.  I've just started the RMA process and will try to update.UPDATE 3:After a phone call to tech support, an email to the sales department, and about 3 weeks of time I have a new camera in black.  They didn't have a silver one and I don't wonder why.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R20RTO2B6N9JNM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do not buy this Foscam camera if you are interested in the two way audio. There are other vendors with less expensive products if you don't need the two way audio and the two way audio on the Foscam is horrible (actually doesn't work). The microphone on the Foscam works, but there is a lot of static when you use the camera wirelessly. The speaker in the camera is totally unworkable for me so far and I work with computer technology for a living. To make matters worse, their technical support is horrendous. I work in technical support myself, so I sent them a very detailed email outlining the audio problems I was encountering and everything I had tried to remedy the problem. I got back a three line email suggesting obvious things that had they read my email they would've known weren't applicable or I had already tried them. Moreover in their reply, they told me that there was no problem with my camera and it must be something else. How the lazy support technician could unilaterally decide that my camera wasn't possibly broken, was an amazing display of ignorance on their part. Although it is possible that the unit I got is defective, I now am more convinced that it is a flawed product design. I determined that by digging on the internet and found out that these audio problems have been discussed many times, including in Foscam's own technical forum's yet the Foscam technical support people claimed ignorance that the problems even exist. I've since seen posts going back over more than a year talking about these problems in various Foscam models. So I have the camera up and running and as far as a the video goes it works fine, but I've had to accept the fact that there will be no two way audio. Being in the computer industry myself, I know technology like this can have its quirks and require some work to run smoothly. So the fact that the audio didn't work out of the box as advertised didn't bother me nearly as much as the crappy support from the company did. Moreover, from what I read on Foscam's own technical forum, it appears as though there is no solution for this problem. So now I must buy another camera for the two way audio application I needed and it WON'T be a Foscam.", "Date": "June 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "This camera has a defect that Foscam.us will not fix.

You can not use 2-way audio when the device is setup to work wirelessly.Note that some users have said that they can get the audio to be \"not horrible\" by removing the antenna (Foscam will tell you to do this as well), but this doesn't fix the issue and it severely limits the range of the wireless functionality.

I have a basic understanding of computers, I know what an IP address is and some other basic networking principles; however I don't care/want to know anything about routing tables, port forwarding etc. Not interested!

However when you want to set it up for monitoring from outside your home (which is really the whole point about having this camera!) that's when the \"fun\" begins.First of all the manufacturers do not care to ship the most up to date manual with the product.

I called tech support ... on 3 different times on 3 different days and left a message 4 times after being assured by the operator that I would get a call back.Finally after the 5th time I refused the call back and got put on support with someone. After trying to determine the problem the engineer determined that my unit was not recognizing DHCP correctly (although all the other networked computers and devices on my network do)so I asked him if we could connect to the device manually using default IP's (this is the normal fail-safe for most items like this camera). Not only did the software not allow this, but the further attempts required me rebooting the entire computer to get the software to prompt me for IP configuration.This is a camera I can get in China for about $15. This company branded the item and is reselling it. No attention has been made to improve the OS or the Firmware, as the firmware is the exact same as the Chinese brand that I had in Hong Kong. To add insult, the most recent software was \"unavailable\" to download off their website. You get what you pay for.UPDATE - I gave this camera a second chance and they have improved their game a little. Still no support and their website is horrific, but the new firmware is not bad. However, these things still like to reset themselves and return back to their \"Home\" position. YOU MUST get the Blue Iris software for this camera. It is fantastic and can link up with several cameras turning this into a very affordable, security and DVR system.I will also say that I had focusing issues with only one cam, no matter what it was always soft even when I adjusted the ring.

I think his name was Henry foster? I was not happy with that, I felt it very intruding and forceful. While he was logged in helping me, he went so fast and did not explain what he was doing at all. How am I supposed to understand what he did?Back to the camera, it works great so far. There is a lag in the audio which is a little annoying. I'm using the camera on wireless so I tried moving it to our wired Ethernet connection and there was no improvement, in fact the video got a lag that wasn't there before. So we're back on wireless. The picture is great, much better than our baby monitor was, and there are a lot of apps to choose from for both android and iOS to view and control the camera.One other annoying thing - the time and date stamp on the log files is way off, despite me having the correct date and time in the settings. This makes it hard to audit, which I like to check on to make sure it is not getting hacked or anything.All in all, I definitely recommend this camera, it's the best we've used for a baby monitor.

Crystal clear video, with picture quality as good as you get from the camera when the room is fully-lit- Very good range of motion - nearly 360\u00ba in all directions. The camera has 8 preset locations so you can save and load your favorite positions (i.e. crib, doorway, main part of room, etc.) without having to navigate the camera to these positions by hand every time- Decent apps to control the camera from Apple devices like the iPhone and iPad. I downloaded \"Baby Monitor for IP Camera\" which was free if you don't need the audio support (this can be added as an in-app purchase). Can't speak to Android support since I don't have an Android device- Able to downscale the resolution to 320x240 which still gives you a very usable picture. This is handy when I'm viewing the camera over 3G or LTE on my iPhone/iPad when away from home, and don't want to burn up all the usage on my limited data plan- Foscam has published well-attended forums on their US web site, with an enthusiastic user community, many of whom are technical enough to provide good suggestions to problems. The staff hasn't been quite as responsive as the user community, but the purpose of a forum is to let the user community support itself to an extent so this isn't such a big deal- There is a very simple web-based API for the camera so you can write your own utilities, or even just hit certain URLs and pull data about the camera. Great for technical folks who want to get under the hoodCONS- At least on the white model (I haven't tried the black one yet) there is an internal network activity light mounted on the circuit board of the camera, and it's visible through the camera case. Since the case is white plastic, it acts as a diffuser. When idling, the light flashes several times a minute and is not that noticeable, but when monitoring video it flashes every time a request comes into the camera to update the image, which is several times a second. My wife and I are concerned that this might cause our little one to be distracted in the dark and interfere with him sleeping. There is an option in the web console to disable the external network monitor light, but this setting has no effect on the internal light I'm describing (nor does it turn off the external red network light, although this is easily solved with a small piece of electrical tape). I have uploaded a product image to show you what the internal network activity looks like in a dark room. It's not quite as bright as my picture makes it look, but it's definitely noticeable.- Some of the default settings for the camera are a bit dumb. For example, initially I couldn't get any of my preset camera positions to save or load. Searching on the forums, it turns out the preset save/load feature is disabled by default. Enabling it is as simple as clicking a check box in the web console and saving, but surely the default should be for this feature to be active?- Security on the camera is pretty much non-existent. Passwords for the administrative web-based console are sent \"in the clear\" (i.e. unencrypted) and there is no HTTPS capability on the device to secure the console. This is more than understandable considering the low cost of the device, but it means that if you use the camera over the Internet to monitor your baby/house/whatever when away from home, anybody could sniff your password and gain access to your webcam. For me, this was not a problem since I have the technical chops to set up SSH tunneling and/or VPN to secure interactions with the console made over the public Internet, but for non-technical users this could be a bit more challenging. Also, if you are only using the camera at home over WiFi and have basic WiFi security enabled on your internal home network, the lack of HTTPS support is a non-issue - this is only really a problem for people using the camera over their cell phone, from a WiFi hotspot in a coffee shop, etc.- I haven't fully diagnosed this next issue yet, but the camera is interfering with the motion sensor on our 10-year-old Brinks home security system. Our nursery is a bedroom on the second floor of our house, while the motion sensor is mounted to the ceiling in the living room directly below the nursery. The morning after I set up the web cam, our security system started indicating trouble with the motion sensor. The sensor still works, although not very well, and the security system starts beeping every morning at 7:15 AM complaining about the issue when the web cam is on (which is really annoying). When I turned off the web cam, the problem went away instantly. There are a few possible issues. The first is that the IR sensor on the camera is interfering with the motion sensor, since the way I had the camera positioned it was pointing right at the spot on the floor above the motion sensor in the living room below. However, this seems unlikely since I don't believe IR light would go through the floor. The second possible issue is that the camera is a wireless networking device on the 2.4Ghz spectrum, which is close to the microwave spectrum, and some motion sensors are microwave-based. If this is the issue then I don't have a resolution on the camera since it doesn't support the 5Ghz 802.11n band. It's possible that I can get a different kind of motion sensor from Broadview (who bought Brinks) but that is likely to incur additional expense.Overall I think this is a really fantastic little camera, and it's pretty much perfect for our needs as a video baby monitor. If the black model solves the flashing internal network light issue and I can get it playing nicely with our home security system, I'll be a very happy camper.UPDATE: I switched my WiFi network to 802.11n on the 2.4Ghz spectrum and it seems to have fixed the issue with our security system's motion sensor. Still working on fixing the internal flashing light issue.UPDATE 2: I ordered a replacement black model, and it does not have the translucency/flashing internal light issue that the white model has. The black model is coated with a rubberized material that gives it a nicer overall finish in my opinion. Based on this, I recommend the black model over the white one.", "Date": "July 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Requires Cal Tech Phd to install", "Author": "Tbone \"tstake\"", "ReviewID": "R2SOOXYF8J006Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "There is nothing more frustrating than purchasing an item, trying to install it and thinking all through out the process you're doing something wrong.

Sadly it was too good to be true. My basic need for a surveillance camera includes the 2-way audio capability. I would not have purchased it had I known that after the past three upgrades to this product, the audio problems have yet to be addressed. This is my second try with FOSCAM, I had hoped that they had improved the audio by now. Sadly, it looks like they have greatly improved the video quality and ignored the audio problems. I guess most buyers are not concerned with audio quality as most of Amazons reviews have been good. It would help if they would state the cameras audio specifications to a level that someone who needs the 2-way capability could decide whether or not to buy this camera. It's a shame that I had to order and test the unit to find that again the audio quality was extremely poor. Talking to FOSCAM.US on this problem is like talking to a brick wall!PROS: video quality has greatly improved due to the addition of an IR cut filter. Otherwise the camera is much the same as earlier versions (pan, tilt, etc.) which are acceptable.CONS:1. Audio reception had terrible ringing and produced 5 to 6 repeats (echo's) of everything said.2. Transmission of my voice via my computer to the unit over my LAN/WAN seemed OK but weak.3. When both the headset icon and the mike icon were activated simultaneously they produced a pinging and bad background noise from the cameras' speaker. This problem alone would allow anyone to locate where the surveillance camera was located.4. If others have found the 2-way audio acceptable then FOSCAM has a significant quality control problem.  RECOMMENDATION:  I firmly believe that Amazon should discontinue selling this camera until FOSCAM can provide evidence that one of its features (2-way audio) has been corrected and now usable. Selling a product with an obvious fault as this is simply not acceptable. If FOSCAM cannot correct the audio problem; a suggested fix for FOSCAM is to remove the 2-way audio circuits from future cameras and remove from their literature that it has a 2-way audio capability.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good camera but a little tricky to set up on web", "Author": "uktravailer", "ReviewID": "RAK0WA82066KY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "[**Updated now with 2nd camera over internet, see below for information on multiple camera set up with dyndns **]I bought this over the cheaper, but older model (FI8918w) based on the reviews saying this had a better picture. So far I am sufficiently pleased that I will look into getting some more to cover more of the house.* Setting up the camera.The camera is very easy to set up as a wifi camera, by following the written instructions and the video that comes on the installation disk.The process involves plugging the camera into your router, installing the software and getting the camera recognized on the network and then unplugging the network cable and logging the camera into your wireless network. All fairly plain sailing, and this allows you to play around with the camera settings, and get used to its operation.Setting up the camera for web access is a little more difficult. The video on the disk is a useful primer, but the best place to go for help is foscam.us forums. In the end it took me a few hours of frustration (and reading), but I am sure this can be alleviated by considering the following points:1. The DNS service at dyndns.org is no longer free, but will give a 14-day trial after which the service is $20 per year.2. I am a Verizon Fios customer and it took me some time to identify that you should NOT allocate port 80 to the camera. It seems that Verizon blocks this port according to one post I read. I allocated port 8090 for this first camera and it worked fine as soon as I did this.3. The Fios router is easy to set up for port-forwarding - it's a hyperlink on the main menu which takes you into the Advanced Options.4. Be patient. You often have to repeat actions on the camera and allow it to reboot a few times before it will show \"success\" on DNS forwarding.* Operating the camera.There are several camera parameters that can be changed, such as picture size, frame rate, brightness and contrast. The IR works well and can be turned on and off remotely.The camera has motion detection, with user sensitivity settings. When in alarm mode the camera can be set to record to your main network PC drive and also take still photos and email them directly to you.The camera has 2-way audio although there is a distinct lag between network and speaker. There is some audio feedback which I managed to alleviate by rotating the camera aerial (wifi antenna) so this it faces flat. I read somewhere that this is due to the way these aerials are coiled inside the wand so that the signal is better from the sides that the wand top, which seems counter-intuitive, but my point is that you should play with the aerial (wifi antenna) position before getting too angry with it :-)Overall I would say this is a good buy at under $100 and gives good pictures. Now that I have set it up I shall be getting some more, so I guess that says it all. The software will allow up to 9 cameras to be connected.I deduct one star as I had to do a fair amount of research, and there really is no need for this. I would think this should be set up in under an hour with the right guidance.[Update 24 March 2012]* Multiple CamerasI bought a second camera and set it up on the network very easily, simply using the IP Camera Tool already installed for the first camera and even the network cable that I had left in the back of the router. Camera #2 was picked up and identified and then I added it to the wifi network as with camera #1.Getting access over the internet was a bit more tricky, although once I had read through the foscam.us forum posts and started thinking properly it was fairly straightforward.I assigned port 8091 to camera #2 (remember to keep away from port 80, as mentioned above) and then copied all the settings from camera #1 to camera#2 in the DDNS Server settings and Mail Service Settings menu (except port number, obviously).* Hint for using presets:If you want to use the preset camera positions you MUST first uncheck the \"disable preset\" box in the PTZ menu under Administrator. Then, if you check \"goto preset on boot\" whenever the camera reboots it will start up in the preset position you last left it in. This of course assumes you have set the preset in the first place under the Operator menu (!) As an aside I don't know why they call it PTZ, as there is no zoom function on this model :-(* Now for the internet:In the Multi-Device Settings it is important NOT to use the local IP address of the camera (e.g. 192.168.1.11) but instead use the the DDNS web address, in my case  [...], when completing the host field.Once done this all works pretty well, and successfully emails me from either camera when motion is detected and records a video to my PC's HDD.Next step, removing the PC as video storage by either using NAS or FTP directly from the router...", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Easy to setup and works great at night", "Author": "YS Sheu \"ss\"", "ReviewID": "R3S413WZ03GGKG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I live in Baltimore where crime has been a major problem.  After being broken in twice, I decided to purchase this relatively inexpensive security camera to monitor my home while I was on a trip.  At first, I was worried about the wireless setup, since I do not have any experience in setting up server or network.  However, the setup turned out to be surprisingly easy, well, at least within my home network.  However, just like a lot of the reviewers, I got stuck on the remote access setup.  After a lot of trouble shooting, I realized that it is because I didn't setup the port forward correctly.  In my house, I have a Linksys wireless router connected to a wireless cable modem, which was provided by my internet service provider.  I placed these two routers in separate rooms, so that I can have strong signals everywhere in my house.  The problem is that I used the Linksys router to configure port forwarding, instead of my primary wireless cable modem, so that every time I try to access my IP camera (which is essentially a server) using my DYNDNS address, I was being routed to the wrong location.  To solve this problem, I reboot the camera by having it connected to the wireless cable modem, and use the wireless cable modem to setup the port forwarding.  Problem solved!!  I also heard about you can turn your wireless cable modem on \"bridge mode\", which is essentially degrade your wireless cable modem to just a modem without the wireless function, and then set up the port forwarding on your wireless router (e.g. Linksys).  Either way would work!  The port forward is really not that hard to set up, and the little booklet that comes with the camera did a decent job on illustrating each step.  Once I realized where I did wrong, it took me only 10 minutes to complete the remote access setup.  To test whether you have the camera correctly setup, simply turn off the wireless function on your 3G or 4G device (e.g. iphone, ipad, ...) and use the cellular data to connect to the camera by entering your dyndns address in a web browser.  If you can see the live stream video, then you are all set.Here are some random notes:1. AwkwardHamster on YouTube did a nice step-by-step illustration on foscam setup for both within and outside of home network.2. If you are an iPad user, there are some great foscam apps for download.  If you simply use a web browser, you won't be able to use the joystick function to point the camera to a specific location.3. some old wireless cable modems (e.g. Zhone, model: 6218-I2-200 0CL) do not have port forward function, in this case, you need to call your Internet service provider and request a replacement (should be free of charge, only shipping cost).4. Some wireless cable modem refer to the port forwarding function as \"virtual server\", you should be able to find it under NAT or Gaming.5. Some reviews complaint that the DYNDNS Host service is not free of charge, which is not true.  You need to sign up for their 14-day free trial, and give them your credit card number.  After you setup the hostname, just cancel the subscription within the trial period, and you still get to keep one hostname free of charge.  Your hostname should connect to the external IP address of your home network, which is the IP you found using the whatismyip webside (do not use any proxy).6. Don't forget to change the default username (\"admin\") and password (no password), otherwise, anybody who knows your dyndns address can access to your camera.__________________________________________________________________A summary of step-by-step remote access setup using dynamic IP:1. Get an account on DYNDNS site and get a free hostname (yes, you need to sign up for the trial and give them your credit card, but you can cancel the subscription within the trial period and still get to keep one hostname).  Your service type should be \"host with IP address\".  DynDNS site will automatically detect your external IP.  If not, just go to whatismyip site and get your external ip address from them.2. Log in to your router: in most cases, type 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1 (if you have more than two wireless routers, use the one from your internet service provider).  You can find the default username and password from the router manual or you can google it on the internet.  The default is often either \"admin\" or \"user\" for both username and password.3. Log in to your camera.  You can do this by using the IP camera tool in the CD or type in the IP that your router assign to your camera in a web browser. It usually begins with 192.168.1.X3. On the menu, go to \"Device Management\", then \"Basic Network Setting\".  Make sure you have the \"Obtain IP from DHCP server\" and \"Network Lamp\" checked.  As for the port, I just use the default \"80\", but I heard some routers save that port for other stuff, so you might want to change it to 8080 or other numbers.  The port number you set up here will determine the specific port that your camera will use and you will need that information when you set up port forwarding.4. On the camera menu, go to DDNS service settings, fill out your DYNDNS account information and your hostname, then \"submit\", and wait for the 30s reboot patiently.  Go to your camera menu again, and \"Device Status\", if it shows \"DynDns Succeed\", then you are good to continue.  Note that it might take some time (5 minutes) for your DynDns account to take effect.5. Go to your wireless router menu again (192.168.1.1), then go to port forwarding (or virtual server).  Both the external and internal ports should match to the port number you set up in the previous step (e.g. 80).  For the protocol, choose \"both\" if you are given an option between TCP or UDP.  If not, just choose TCP.6. To test out the remote access, you must use a computer outside of your home network or use your 3G/4G device with cellular data (remember to shut off the wireless!!) or use your computer with a proxy to mask your external router IP.  Open up a web browser and key in your DYNDNS address followed by a colon [ : ] and your port number (e.g. 80).7. If you are within the home network, you must use the camera IP and correct port (e.g. 192.168.1.4:80) to access your camera.Hope this helps!!", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Junk - Don't believe the hype", "Author": "G.

Plus, it means my husband can spy on the baby from work, too :)The Foscam seemed to have pretty good reviews overall, so we decided to give it a shot.  The price far beats some of the top-rated video baby monitors and offers viewing flexibility that a technologically savvy family can appreciate.Without further adieu, here's my quick break-down:Pros:- Love the ability to view baby from multiple devices.  There are several options for apps on both IOS and Android for viewing on this camera.- Infrared works GREAT.  I can get clear views of my daughter from her nearly-pitch-black bedroom.- Infrared lights are very dim and not too distracting (though I don't have experience with other infrared lights...just saying that they're not super-bright or an issue in a baby's room)- Totally silent adjusting.  Yes, this camera is all ninja when you're panning around the room.  The only times it makes noises is when the infrared goes on/off, it makes a quiet clicking sound.  Otherwise, it's quiet enough to give you the confidence that it will NOT wake a baby when you adjust it.- Wireless feature allows for you to use without being hooked up to a computer--something a regular webcam cannot deliver in this situation.Cons:- Set up (as many have mentioned) can be a PAIN.  If you are not familiar with tinkering with your router settings and all that, I'd say get help from someone who does.  I consider myself to be intermediate with technology, and when following the instruction manual, I got frustrated.  My husband finished the job quickly.  Though, when we got a new internet service provider, he had a more difficult time when a new modem/router came into play and it took him quite a while longer to get that figured out.- It's big and ugly.  I can't lie, it's not the prettiest thing to have in your baby's room and certainly much bulkier and less aesthetically pleasing than a lot of baby video cameras...but you sacrifice beauty for functionality.  You'll soon forget about that when you're giggling at your ridiculous baby's antics in clear view.- I'm not sure why, but we have issues with it regularly resetting.  (You know this because when it resets, it runs through a series of panning around and will finally stop at a pre-designated position which is always pointing away from the baby's crib).

These leads to the biggest problem 3) The support has been TERRIBLE, even though I paid extra to get them from the true Foscam DLL company.  Technical support is in India and their only explanation for problems was to blame my router.  One camera was clearly defective with a dead pixel line and it was apparently still the router's fault.  Numerous phone calls after many failed \"we will call you back in 2 hours\" resulted in them finally issuing an RMA# (note there is no RMA process detailed on the foscam website), and I still had to call almost daily to see when they were going to ship the replacement camera to me.  2 months later and finally the replacement has appeared, but they are still holding out on reimbursing the defective camera's shipping cost as they had promissed.  You can tell a company has no interest in support when they give you random names as reference for the calls - I'm referring to you Robert/Jake/Charles - the exact same support person in India (yes I've had to call them that many times!)", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera; difficult set-up", "Author": "Theodore Lesnett", "ReviewID": "RVJKJB30SY2ES", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera works flawlessly, the picture is crystal clear, the night vision awesome.Setting it up attached to a cable is straightforward.  Make it wireless and accessable from outside your network, much more difficult.The IP Camera Tool didn't work, but the workaround is simple once you know.Just type the camera IP address into your URL search (192.168.11.144) and the Monitoring System should come right up.You will need to be able to get into your router.  Again, typing this address into your URL search and it should come right up: 192.168.1.1In your router, (I'll use CISCO as an example) you will need to go to the Wireless tab, Basic Wireless Settings,  and check Manual and Enable SSID Broadcast.  Wireless Security tab should be WPA2 Personal and your passphrase (password) must match the password in the camera.In the Administrator tab of the Real-Time IP Camera Monitoring System you need to go to Basic Network Settings and manually type in the IP Address of the camera, and the following numbers:  Subnet Mast 255.255.255.0 Gateway 192.168.1.1 DNS Server 192.168.1.1 Http Port 80 Network Lamp (checked).  How to get the IP Address of the camera?  Here it is:  192.168.1.144.  Then Wireless LAN Settings and click the scan button and then pick your router from the list.  The SSID must match your router SSID, the Encryption is WPA2 Personal (AES) and the share key is the same as the passphrase or password of the router (above). Now, the last thing will to be set up Port Forwarding to see your wireless camera from some net connection outside of your own router.  To do this you go back into the router and find Single Port Forwarding.  In Cisco its under Gaming.  There you assign an application name, like My Cam, type 80 for the External and Internal Port, and in that line's IP Address add 144 so it reads 192.168.1.144 and Enable it by checking a box.All this done, unplug the camera from the router and in your URL search type the camera's IP address and it should work:  192.168.1.144.  Outside of your network you can see it by typing your IP Address (you can get it from your router (or Google What Is My ISP) then add a colon and your port number which we above gave as 80.  So it could be:  xx.xx.xxx.xx:80.What is important is that the places in your router and in the camera Administration list I've mentioned all need to be addressed and most of the numbers and i.d.s must match across the router and the camera.Its a great camera.

Everything worked great for me by making sure I set up my port as 8000 instead of 80 and by following the instructions here: [...]Now, it took me a while because I didn't set up my port as 8000 instead of port 80, but just in case some of you are like my parents and want a step by step guide to setting this thing up, here are the steps that helped me get my camera working on the wireless network with remote access:1. Plug in your Foscam FI8910W IP Camera2. Connect your Foscam FI8910W IP Camera to your wireless router with the ethernet cord that comes in the box.3. Find out what IP address your camera is operating on.- If you have a PC, you can get instructions for doing this here: [...]- If you have a MAC, you can get instructions for doing this here: [...]4. Configure your Wireless LAN Settings in the Foscam FI8910W IP Camera Device Management tab from your web browser.- Click on Wireless LAN Settings and get your camera connected wirelessly. If you are having problems, follow the steps here: [...]- You should now be able to disconnect the ethernet cable from the back of your camera and move the camera to the location you are going to use it at. You may have to repeat step 3 above if you are using DHCP. You probably are, so repeat step 3 and make sure you can connect into the Device Management tab wirelessly before going to step 5.5. Configure your Users Settings in the Foscam FI8910W IP Camera Device Management tab from your web browser.- Click on Users Settings and change the admin password to something you'll remember and also add a user and password and select Visitor for the group (this is so you can let friends and family see the video without having access to change any settings).- After you hit Submit, you may have to log in to your camera again with the admin information.6. Configure your Basic Network Settings in the Foscam FI8910W IP Camera Device Management tab from your web browser.- Keep \"Obtain IP from DHCP Server\" checked- Change the \"Http Port\" from 80 to 8000- Keep \"Network Lamp\" checked (unless you want to turn off the LED on the back off)7. Configure your Wireless Router for Port Forwarding. This essentially sets up remote access for your Foscam FI8910W IP Camera. I have a Linksys Router, so all I did was access the Linksys Router Administration Panel by going to 192.168.1.1 in my web browser and putting in my username and password. If you have a different router, the process may be similar, but you can follow the instructions for setting up port forwarding by selecting your router manufacturer on the list here: [...]- In the Linksys Router Administration Panel, click on the Applications & Gaming tab and fill in these settings:-- Application FOSCAM-- Start 8000-- End 8000-- Protocol TCP-- IP Address 192.168.1.111 (or the IP Address that you found the camera on earlier)-- Enable check- Click \"Save Settings\" at the bottom of the page.8. Find out what your External IP address is.- You can find out your External IP Address here: [...]9. Access your Foscam FI8910W IP Camera over the internet remotely!- In your web browser type in [...] hit enter, and then log into the Foscam FI8910W IP Camera Administration Panel as you did earlier.10. If you want to share just the video with your friends and family tell them to type in [...] to their web browser and provide them with the Visitor Username and Password you created earlier in step 5. You are essentially done at this step if you want to be, because everything should be working correctly at this point, but if you want to have an easier web address to give to friends and family, continue to step 11.11. Set up a free account on [...]- Sign up for a free account on [...]- Once you are registered and logged in, click on \"Add a Host\"-- Type in a hostname-- Select Port 80 Redirect--- Your External IP Address should be filled in for you--- Change the Port from 8080 to 8000-- Type in what you want the title of the page to be along with keywords and a brief description (This is not a necessary step, but just adds to the experience).-- Click on \"Create Host\" at the bottom of the page.- Once that is done, now you can direct your friends and family to simply go to [...] and they will be able to see your video over the web.

Timothy Holman", "ReviewID": "R2P9RBCCVF2BEN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought one of these cameras, set it up in my den, and later bought three more to provide coverage for other areas in my house.  Is it a great camera in terms of resolution and frame rate?  Not really.  But is it a great camera in terms of its price?  Absolutely.  You won't find better \"bang for the buck\" at this price point.First the good:(1)  It is very inexpensive; you'll be hard-pressed to find so many features at this price in other low-end cameras.(2)  Construction quality is very good; the camera seems sturdy and well-built.(3)  WiFi range is excellent - I am having no problems getting a good image anywhere in my house.(4)  PTZ gives you almost 360 degrees of view if you rotate from one extreme to the other.(5)  The built-in infrared diodes are bright enough to easily illuminate an entire room for nighttime viewing.(6)  You get a nice screw-in mount and a convenient retractable Ethernet cable bundled with the camera.Now the not-so-good:(1)  The camera lens has significant \"fish eye\" distortion.(2)  With a 640 x 480 pixel resolution, you're not going to be getting a good picture of an intruder's face unless he gets fairly near the camera in good lighting conditions.  If you need a higher-resolution image, you're going to have to spend more money on a better camera.(3)  The effective frame rate is not that high - maybe 3 to 5 fps if you're watching an image from outside your home network.(4)  The audio quality from the built-in speaker and microphone is adequate, but not very impressive.  You can hear what's going on through the camera, and be understood at the other end, but it's like talking through a long stovepipe.  On the other hand, it is more than adequate for a baby monitor.(5)  It is a pain to set up unless you know what you're doing.Fortunately, at least for Mac users, it's not that hard to configure it once you know the trick.  Here is what to do, assuming you have a Mac laptop and a wireless home router with at least one free Ethernet port:(1)  Copy over FOSCAM's \"IP Camera Tool\" app onto your Mac.  You can either copy it from the bundled CD, or download it from the FOSCAM site.(2)  Now open System Preferences on your Mac, and click on the Network icon.  When the network window opens, click on the Wi-Fi tab (if it's not already selected) and click the \"Advanced\" button in the lower right hand corner of the window.(3)  In the new window that appears, click the \"TCP/IP\" tab.  Write down the Subnet Mask and Router IP addresses, and then close System Preferences window.(4)  Now here's the tricky part:  you have to decide which IP address on your router you want to reserve for the camera.  For example, if your Router IP address is 10.0.1.1, you'll want to change the last number to use as your camera IP address, e.g. 10.0.1.61 or 10.0.1.100 for the camera.  However, you don't want to re-use an existing address that the router has already allocated.  You have two choices:  either log in to your router and check which addresses are being currently allocated, or just pick a number between 2 and 255 at random, e.g. 10.0.1.61, and see if it works.  Obviously these numbers may be different depending on the router.  For example, if your Router IP address is 192.68.2.1, then you can try 192.68.2.61 or 196.68.2.100 for the camera.(5)  Turn off your Mac's Wi-Fi connection.  Plug the camera into your Mac's Ethernet port using the supplied cable, but don't connect the camera's AC adapter yet.(6)  Start the IP Camera Tool app.  An empty window will open on your desktop.  Now turn on the camera by plugging in its AC adapter.  After about 20 seconds, the camera will begin to rotate through its start-up sequence.  At that point, you'll get several socket error warnings from the IP Camera Tool.  Click through these errors, and you'll finally get back to the IP Camera Tool window, which will show an Anonymous device (this is the camera) with an incorrect subnet error message, asking you to double-click to fix it.(7)  When you double-click the message in the window, a small window will open.  For the IP address, fill in the address you've chosen for your camera.  For the Subnet Mask, use the same number you wrote down earlier.  For Gateway and DNS Server, fill in the Router IP address you wrote down earlier.(8)  Leave the password field blank, with user \"admin\".  Click OK.(9)  The camera will restart.  After it has restarted, you'll start getting socket error warnings again.  Ignore them, unplug the camera, and quit the IP Camera Tool app.(10)  Now use the Ethernet cable to plug the camera into an unused Ethernet port on your router.  Plug in the AC adapter and wait for the camera to restart.(11)  Turn on your laptop's WiFi again.  Open the Safari browser and type in the IP address you chose for the camera, e.g. the http prefix followed by 10.0.1.61.(12)  If you did everything right, you'll be able to log in to the camera's built-in web server and configure it using the Device Management tab.  Specifically, you can scan for a wireless network list under \"Wireless LAN Settings\", select your own home network, enter the password, and click the box labeled \"Using Wireless LAN\".  Click Submit and the camera will restart again.(13)  Now unplug the camera from the router.  Again, use your Safari browser to access the IP address of the camera (you may have to close and re-open the Safari window).  If your wireless connection is working, you'll be able to log in to the camera again, and make any other configuration changes that you want.If you want to use your camera outside of your home network, you'll need to learn about port forwarding.  I won't go into that, because it is dependent on the router, but for my cameras I use port 80 for the internal port of each camera, and ports 8101 through 8104 for my external ports, respectively.  It works fine, and I can watch my home over my iPhone without any difficulty.As a final note, I strongly recommend that you buy the Foscam Pro app for your iPhone / iPad.

My sister recommended the Motorola MBP36 that she's been using. This and the the Summer Infant Infant model seem to be the mostly highly regarded. But I really liked the idea of being able to view from anywhere, on iPhones, iPads and Android. (I currently have an iPad and a Samsung Galaxy Note). I had found the Samsung SmartCam Baby Monitor at Target.  So I thought I'd give it a try before spending the big bucks for those with dedicated monitors. I was disappointed in it's performance and features so it was returned after just a few days.Speaking to a couple of friends, I was warned against units with dedicated displays.  The displays often degrade over time because of the lower quality TFT LCD screens.So I did a bit more research and tried something not even advertised as a \"Baby Monitor\". The Foscam FI8910W. It a IP Camera with excellent features and performance. Once I tried this, it was day and night. The setup is more geeky. To view the feed from the internet, you'll have to know how to setup your router for port mapping and have either a static IP or Dynamic DNS. But for a person like me who deals with this stuff all the time, it was quite simple, no trial and error. Either you know how to do it or you don't. You're streaming directly from the Camera so there's no delay and the video quality, although not HD (there's also an HD version the FI9820W but never tried this), is fantastic! The night time performance is awesome. It supports Pan and Tilt, but not Zoom (some software will allow digital zoom, but this is pretty useless). On my iPad it looks amazing, way better than even the Motorola unit. Same on my Galaxy Note and any of my computers. The video doesn't degrade when you're connected from outside you home network. The two-way audio, although not fantastic is more than acceptable. It's bigger unit, but it doesn't take up much more room than the Samsung, which is flat. The biggest plus, it's less than $90 on Amazon. So while I wait for my wife to pop, I'm using the camera to monitor my Dog while I'm at work. I've even been able to get his attention when he's up to no-good while I'm at the office.Pros-Great Video quality and frame-rate-Fantastic PanTilt performance-Fantastic Night performance, LEDs come on automatically as needed.-Audio performance is more than adequate.-Built-In Streaming server that you can setup with various Viewer Apps on difference platforms (PC, MAC, IOS and Android)-LAN and Wifi ConnectionCons-Internet viewing setup can be a bit much for those not familiar with port mapping, static external IP or DDNS.  It might also be a bit challenging for some to locate the initial IP address, although there's a small application avaiable on the CD to discover it.

Foscam's documentation will get you started, but that's about it.  **THEREFORE, IF YOU ARE NOT TECHNICALLY PROFICIENT OR FAMILIAR WITH BASIC NETWORK ARCHITECTURE & PROTOCOLS THE ADVANCED FEATURES OF THIS CAMERA WILL BE TOUGH FOR YOU TO SETUP.**On to the good:  The basic stuff this camera is supposed to do - connect quickly to your wireless network, pan/tilt/zoom, capture great images in regular and little/no light at reasonable distances - just works, it's fantastic.  The applications available for viewing the video on your iOS or Android device are all over the map, more on this later, but initial setup was a breeze and, again, it just works.  The advanced features, such as motion sensing, the ability to email you a picture, save a picture or video stream and forward all such traffic outside your wireless LAN to the interwebs at large also just work.  These advanced features took a little while to setup and again, if you're not familiar with port forwarding and dynamic DNS hosting services then this stuff will be difficult for you.  I am an experienced user and it took me a couple hours to make it all work.  Some of that time was spent hunting around for better documentation though because, again, Foscam's documentation sucks, but once I got it, it was awesome.Recommended Mobile Application:  THIS IS IMPORTANT so I'm surprised there is less commentary out there on which mobile app is the best.  Your mobile app is primarily how you are going to view the video stream, at least that's true for me so the app you choose affects how many of the camera's features you can enjoy.  I tried a couple but BY FAR the best one out there, at least for iOS is LiveCams Pro (available here: [...]).  A buddy of mine - a very advanced user who has an Android device - uses the same and I actually thought the Android interface was a little more robust and easier to use.Final Analysis:  We bought this as a baby monitor but after seeing all that it will do I'm buying at least 2 or 3 more for home security purposes.  I am VERY impressed with this little thing's skills.  I highly recommend this for use either as a baby monitor or a security camera.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Understand What your buying, and know you need to understand Networks.", "Author": "Darped", "ReviewID": "RC9K8KAMNICGD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am getting tired of all these reviewers bashing these foscam cameras.  the prodcut works, and if you know nothing about the industry and cant tell the difference between analog cctv camera setups vs IP based setups dont bother buying this product.I have installed approximately 100 fi8918's fi8905's, and these over the last year w/ minimal effort and issues.

I can no longer get full resolution, which results in a tiny 320xsomething small like 160 screenshot, entirely useless for surveillance.I contacted foscam, and this was the response from tech support. broken english and all,\"In the first, I doubted there was a reboot issue when light is too bright and the environment is very exquisite (light is very bright and has many grass and trees).In such a special environment, the picture size may beyond the DSP buffer and camera will reboot.However, you mention it will also happen at night.It may caused by the drop wifi issue, please wired connect it to have a test.\"basically, this 'amazing' tech support rep told me at first that the reflection of light and grass(detail in general) would cause the camera to have issues.

I can even deal with the crappy mount. Just get better anchor/screw setup and you wont have any issues, that is, if you can get the camera to work with how you need it. I couldnt.foscam does offer a signal booster antenna, but based on the reviews, the signal booster is entirely useless as well. I think my ultimate resolution to this problem will be to return the new camera as well and go with another brand period.Foscam's reply to all of this, as a general statement, was that amazon sellers sell a 'knockoff', so they do not provide support..what a shame.its very rare that a product in the top 5 of any category happens to be so low quality..would not recommend this as a wireless camera at all..I guess it would be ok for wired purpose but then why spend the money towards a wireless camera at all?", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do Not Buy", "Author": "ARN0LD_LAYNE", "ReviewID": "R313GM3NUKRL9L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do not buy these cameras as the new versions have numerous problems.

IPCamera could be the ultimate solution for someone looking for a flexible baby monitor, here is my experience:The Camera:* The picture quality is good for the cost, significantly better than the Summer Infant video monitor it was replacing* Dark picture quality is exceptional* The camera itself is larger than most packaged baby-cams though for us that didn't matter* The speaker in the camera is weak so sending audio to the camera is a gimmick that doesn't work well* The built in web monitoring tools are weak though you likely won't use them muchSetup:This is an IP Camera and does little or nothing to help the tech novice. If you know your way around a router and are willing to spend some time reading then it is easy enough to figure out (see the excellent info in the review from R.Tickle). To fully setup this camera you need to know how to do the following:* Log into your router to find the cameras IP address* Assign a static IP address* Setup port forwarding on your routerIf you don't know what those things and aren't interested in learning then then this may not be the product for you.As a baby monitor:The challenge here is finiding the right app for your device. For iOS \"Baby Monitor for IP Camera\" is perfect and will do everything your out of the box solution does and more. Android is a stickier problem to solve, \"IP Cam Viewer Pro\" seems to be the best option out there but it isn't ideal for things like overnight audio monitoring. I hope the options for both iOS and Android improve in the coming months and I expect they will.The advantages of having the monitor on all our \"smart devices\" (we use iPad, iPhone, Android and Kindle Fire) as well as the ability for me to see my little one wake up when I am at my desk at work are huge wins for me. You can also capture stills or video right to your device which is something I wish I had many times with the out of the box monitor. Overall I believe an IP Camera is the best monitoring solution for any tech savvy parent, the benefits massivley outweigh the downsides.ONE BIG DRAWBACK. Using an IP Camera means that the monitor is stuck at home or will need to be setup on another wireless network to make it work. If you plan to travel a lot with your child and want your monitor to travel with you then I would suggest buying a cheap audio only monitor to suppliment this.

My motivation to get a camera was to use it as a baby monitor, I was going to also hook this up to my Synology NAS DS 211 with surveillance station.Setup:I work in I.T. so I wasn't too worried about the setup as some people have complained about it. With that being said I felt it was very easy to set up and had the wireless and port forwarding setup in less than half an hour. Since I knew what I was doing in advance I cant remark on how difficult/easy the documentation is to read for a novice user in setting it up.Video Quality:I don't have much experience with IP cameras but I am very pleased with the video quality. I have seen cameras with similar specs selling for much more than this so for ~ $100 bucks you cant be too picky. The quality and detail it picked up is more than adequate for what I need. The night vision was great, In a large room and very low light I was able to pick up everything in its line of sight very clearly. The one thing I noticed that I've seen on other reviews was a faint clicking noise when the IR lamps were on.Other Features:I like that it also has a built in mic and speaker so i can pick up the sounds nearby and also transmit audio to the device. I've already freaked my wife out a few times with this. The pan tilt and zoom is great also. There are a few spots it cant rotate to and the digital zoom is just that so you lose a lot of quality when you zoom in. If you are going to be using this with a Synology Disk Station some of these features are not available through their surveillance station so be prepared for that. From the forums at Synology it looks like they are working on getting all the features enabled but it sounds like both Synology and Foscam blame each other for the things that don't work so im not holding my breath.Interface:The built in web interface is okay. Nothing to spectacular and I honestly didn't play around with it all that much. I will be doing most of my Live viewing from my iPhone or iPad so I use an app called LiveCamPro which is excellent and worth the money.All in all I think for what you get with this camera it is a bargain.

Every other camera that tries to connect thru Wifi is slowwwwwwwwwww. It would take 10-15 seconds for the camera to pop up when I set up the far more expensive \"Dropcam\" when I was in my own home on the same network, and I believe they take up a ton of your bandwith. Foscam loads in an INSTANT from home. It seems to always be connected, making me feel much better unlike the other monitors that seem to connect whenever they feel like it. The image even loads in less than 5 seconds at my work guest server, which is the definition of INCREDIBLY slow. I was pretty amazed about that.Plus, Dropcam and other cameras had way way way less features in their app store as they only have THEIR app, it didn't pan/tilt, and they charged $10 a month if you wanted to record with it. And the notifications were terrible. Foscam has NUMEROUS apps on both Iphone and Droid, so you can test out many of them until you find the one that works for you (even has dedicated baby monitor apps with sound graphs and such). I use my old Droid phones as monitors now. Two-way talk works better than I think people give it credit, as the other 2 more expensive monitors I had sounded about the same or worse I thought. Plus, if you want, you can hook up a mini speaker to the camera since it even has audio jacks in the back.One thing I haven't heard people say - I thought the camera was pretty big. It was bigger than the others for sure (won't fit on a window sill), but it does come with a mount if you want to hang it on the wall somewhere. But, you can buy 2 for the price of 1 of the other ones, and I like how much it can pan around the room a lot more than I thought I would.Setup -For those that want to use this just to view when you are at home (like as a baby monitor), setup is a piece of cake. The install instructions have been updated it seems since many of the youtube postings (search \"awkwardhamster foscam\" and you'll find a ton of them), but they still help, so if you are feeling overwhelmed just watch those 15 min vids before doing anything and it will definitely help. To install from the CD, I clicked the 3rd folder (03_Central Management Software), then connected the camera power and ethernet cable, then opened the windows folder (01_For Windows OS) and it found my camera. Double click on it and follow the youtube video instructions to continue.As for setting it up to view from anywhere - yes, this was a royal pain in the arse. It SHOULD have been a lot easier as there are pretty good step by step instructions on how to do it via those youtube videos and even the instructions that come with it... however, for me, it just simply didn't work at first.The host site would just show it as not connected even after doing everything. After getting really pissed for about 20 minutes... POOF, the site just magically worked. At first I tried creating a no-ip.info address, and after that failed, the newer ones have their own website you can use if you enable it in the DDNS options. But... that one didn't work either.So I tried modifying like 30 different IP numbers, port forwarding numbers, changing passwords... all failing. Then, I don't even know what I did or how it happened, but I tried it again, and BOTH redirecting sites worked. I guess some of these server things just take time to load. I'd recommend creating the no-ip host site, set up the port forwarding numbers, then going out for dinner and coming back before trying anything.Other Camera Comparisons -Every other non-IP camera out there costs as much as it does because they try to make it \"simple.\" Once you figure this one out, I find it even simpler. You just have to remember/write down a few IP numbers, create some passwords, and once you have it all, you can put them into your phone apps and forget about them for the time being. The thing that bothered me most with the other cameras is that none of their apps had a \"sound bar\" so that if the volume on my monitor is low, I could still see that the baby is crying because it would have those red bars showing up like a traditional monitor. IP cameras have plenty of apps that will do just that, and worlds more that I have yet to discover such as recording and taking pics and whatnot.I very much like my new toy, especially for under $100.

McLeland", "ReviewID": "R2YRFP2TS51GES", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, this will be a long review as I am including a setup tutorial below.Second, I don't believe most of the reviews on here are real. I'm pretty sure all of the reviews that call out specific customer service reps are fake. Those users only have reviews for one item - this camera.Now, on to this camera. I was looking at video monitors for my baby's room and was just baffled at how some companies could justify charging 2-300 dollars for a video monitoring system. I looked into network security cameras and settled on one I felt met my needs for a far lower price. I think the price they ask for this is fair.Notes:The plastic of the camera feels a bit cheap and flimsy, but once it is mounted, I am comfortable with it and sure there will not be a problemIt is larger than I expected it to be.The camera occasionally reboots for an unknown reason.I will say that this camera probably will not be easy to set up for a lot of people. I feel like you need to have a medium-high level of tech understanding to get this running on your own.Here is a detailed list of what I did to set up the camera which can be used as a tutorial. This is Windows specific.In-Home viewing (Inside my home network)- I ignored the CD that came with it. I find that most of the time the software provided by the company doesn't get in to the level of detail I prefer when setting these things up.- Plugged the camera in to the wall, then attached the provided network cable to the camera and my router.- Checked my router for the assigned I.P. address and MAC address of the camera- Entered the camera's I.P. address and port number (I believe it was 22) into my web browser (I use Chrome), a la xxx.xxx.xx.12:22.- Logged in as Admin and started going through settings.  - Clicked \"Alias Settings\" to change the camera name. I called mine BabyCam. When you are logged in to the camera, this will appear as the title in the tab you are viewing as \"Device(BabyCam)\".  - Date and Time settings. Set it to Central time and picked time.nist.gov as the time server to sync to.  - Users. I added two additional users, one for me and one for my wife. Note that you CAN NOT change the admin password when you are logged in as Admin!- Went back to my router and added a static I.P. for the camera. The exact process varies depending on the router you have, but the basic concept involves entering the MAC address of the camera and the static I.P. you want the device to have inside your network. I arbitrarily set the address to xxx.xxx.xx.49 and saved the setting, which restarts my router.- Disconnected then reconnected the power plug to the camera. This causes it to connect to the assigned I.P. address you just created.- Navigate to the new I.P. address you set up. In my case this is xxx.xxx.xx.49:22.  - Log in to the camera.  - Navigate to the \"Basic Router Settings\" tab.  - Uncheck the \"Obtain IP from DHCP Server\" box. We want to tell the camera which I.P. to use.  - In the \"IP Addr\" box, enter the I.P. you specified as static in your router settings.  - Enter your subnet mask. Most cases this is 255.255.255.0. To be sure, you can type \"cmd\" in the Search box of the Windows Start button to open a command prompt. Type \"ipconfig\" and hit enter. Subnet mask will be buried in the results, usually 4-6 lines from the top of the result output.  - Gateway and DNS Server should be set to your router's IP address.  - Enter a port number you want the camera to use. This can be any number, really. You don't want it to collide with anything else on your network, though, so pick something weird. I used the year of my birth and added a 1 to the end.  - Leave \"Network Lamp\" unchecked. Keeps that pesky green light on the back of the camera from flashing in your baby's room.  - Click \"Submit\". Your camera will restart. - Once the restart is complete, go to the Wireless LAN settings and set up your wireless router properties if you plan to use the camera on your wireless network. When you submit, the camera will restart again.- I ignored the ADSL, UPnP, and DDNS settings tabs. I set up dynamic DNS stuff on my own using [...]. Use the comment section if you want instructions on this.- I also ignored the rest of the settings. Since I am using this for a crib monitor I don't really want a zillion motion-detected pictures taken. Babies move a lot. ;-)To change Admin password, log out of the camera interface, then log back in as one of the new users you set up. Change the admin password, then save. Camera will reset.At this point you should be able to use the camera wirelessly anywhere in your house and access the camera feed from any device in your network by using a web browser and navigating to the camera's I.P. address and port number, logging in, and clicking \"Live Video\".For viewing on a mobile device, download one of many apps available in the Play store (I use an Android device). My app of choice is IP Cam Viewer Lite. This does not mean it is the best. :-)Good luck.

I say from lots of experience:  No one else comes close.Setting up these cameras will annoy you.Talking to Foscam will annoy you.Eventually you'll have a hardware failure that will annoy you.Deal with it.  You can buy 4-5 of these for the price of the next best IP camera **and still not get any better results** -- excepting customer service.  Foscam does exceedingly poorly at that.  Again, just deal with it.Pros: - Cheap - Great performance - Great features - Great configurability - Best IR performance for cameras 4x in price -- monitor large rooms in the dark with no problem! - Great software support by PC, Mac and Android app vendors - DDNS set up is now automatic if you want it (a major improvement for non-techies)Cons: - No zoom - Internal IR sensor make an audible 'click' when light levels change and IR is activated/deactivated.  Internal IR sensor is overly sensitive and can cycle on & off multiple times when ambient light is changing (sun going down, etc.).  Combine the two and you can end up with a camera clicking annoyingly every 10-20 seconds for a few minutes. - Setup is annoying (but they are improving!) - Customer Support (but they are working on it - last two emails I sent not only got an answer (surprise!) but within 24 hours (major surprise!))Advice (IMPORTANT NOTE:  This is different, and **guaranteed** better, than several other recommendations I read): - Don't use DDNS.  Just pick a high IP address and leave them there.  Example:  If you have 1-100 active but only 10 devices connecting to your network.  Assign the camera to 95 and nothing will bother it.  -- If you do want a dynamic IP, Foscam now defaults to their own service which worked fine in my brief tests. - Turn off the Network Lamp in configuration -- its overly bright and draws attention to the camera.  (Electrical tape also works) - Don't set Patrol Speed to 0 or 1.  Its too fast to control on an app.  2 is the minimum with a fast connection.  3-4 is better. - Set up Mail Settings so you get notified when your IP address changes. - If you want these for Security, buy the Blue Iris software.  Tuning the Alarm sensitivities is an adventure you likely won't be fully happy with.  But it is tunable and, in the end, its only hard drive space so go for it! - Port forwarding is beyond the scope of this review.  But suffice it to say:  Every camera needs its OWN port -- even though the internal IPs are different.  Externally you will hit one IP:nnnn (assigned port number).  And if you have a guest network, DO NOT put any cameras on it.  They must all be on the home/base network!

Setting up the basics to view video is simple. If you want the ability to view remotely you need to know something about Router port forwarding and IP address reserving. If you have a dynamic IP on your Router (most of us do) then I suggest signing up with a free DNS service so you never lose remote access if your ISP changes your IP. If you will be logging video and images then make sure you got enough hard drive space.I have it set up to upload images to my local FTP server upon motion (and/or audio trigger) alarm. I also have it set up to send me an email upon motion and/or audio alarm and to record video and save it to my local computer which I can log into and download from anywhere (via my own FTP server).I added the mobile phone Android App which works great. It allows me to watch live video and control the pan-tilt.The video quality is good at 640x480. If you want higher resolution you are going to have to pay $$.

The IR kicks in automatically and does a good job in the crossover light period too.The extra stuff it has is audio recording and two-way audio. It does work but I have yet to fully use these features but I will and will let you know.A couple of side notes. In order to utilize some of the features of this camera like video recording you need to use Internet Explorer and select the Active X control mode. It works with other browsers but some of the features don't show up. I found this out because I use Chrome and couldn't see how to record video upon alarm detection. I sent an email to Foscam and that evening they responded to my question telling me to use Active X in IE. Good service response albeit probably a question they get often.Also, don't use the CMS software they include on the CD. It is buggy (found one where it would crash the program), clunky and didn't really seem to work. I couldn't delete or edit a camera, strange.

The build quality of these cameras is about what you would expect for the price: flimsy and low-end.  The first of the two cameras works o.k., though the speaker is essentially a crackly, non-functional noisemaker.  The microphone pops and snaps, but it picks up enough for our purposes.  The camera does not adjust well to sunlit or shadowed rooms.  However, aside from this minor complaint, the video quality, particularly when using IR, is quite good for such an inexpensive camera, though.  It's not crystal-clear HD, but for $60, it serves its purpose.The second camera's microphone was completely non-functioning, and the speaker suffered with the same problems.  Support was a little slow to respond, but did not give us any trouble returning the unit.The software is definitely substandard compared to other cameras, but we use the IP Cam Viewer app by Robert Chou on iphone and Android instead, so this isn't a big issue.  Overall, you get what you pay for.  If you're expecting an amazing, highly functional camera with two-way audio for $60, you should adjust your expectations.

The only complaint I would have is that I can't set a motion detect zone or zones like my old D-Link camera could. I'd like to be able to just monitor a portion of the field of view for motion instead of the apparent averaging of overall frame motion, so I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, but still for the low cost, it's great.", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome IP Camera!", "Author": "S.

I would imagine that your average consumer would have a bit of a hard time following the rather poorly translated instructions.

I have the D-link 932L at the front door, because it has Night Vision. The D-Link 930L facing my sliding back door it doesn't have Night Vision. I have the Foscam facing out the second floor window of my room overlooking my backyard. I like the Foscam it has a good picture but a little choppy compared to my 932L. The field of view of the Foscam seems wider compared to my 930L. I Like the Pan/Tilt, because it lets me scan my whole backyard where my 930L only lets me see part of my yard. The Night Vision on the Foscam doesn't work for me, because the Cam is a little fat, and sits far enough away from the window that it reflects the IR back blinding it. My 932L I can push up against the window allowing the IR to get through the glass, if you need a good front door cam with Night Vision I would recommend getting D-Link 932L. The Foscam was easy to setup only one small hic was that it changed the IP address by 3 numbers when I unplugged it to go wireless. No big deal, because the IP Camera Tool on the CD will show you the change. The Firmware was also the latest version, which was nice to see on an out of the box device. All in all if you need a good indoor cam this is a great cam to have. If you want to use it to monitor the outside of your house at night I wouldn't recommend it, unless you're going to mount it outside not sure how weather proof it is. The Night Vision thing was the only reason I dropped it one star. I use my iPad to monitor all my cams with an app called uCamPro HD, it cost $10 after you do the in app purchase for multi cams. It allows me to view all my cams live not just one live, and the rest still images like some apps do.

For those people who wrote positive reviews on this camera must be fake reviewers or they got bribed somehow by Foscam. There is no way on earth this camera can even earn this kind of positive reviews unless quality is not an issue to you.Going back to 6 months ago, I recalled how frustrated it was to set these cameras up. It took us nearly 3 hours with our IT department just to get 1 camera up and running. We were not planning to call Foscam because we do not want strangers to remote access our server computers. Plus, I don't think you can rate a product with 5 stars with \"good technical support\" because the best customer service should be NO CUSTOMER SERVICE, which means the product should simply just be easy to setup.Anyways, stay away from these horrible Chinese products with horrible English instruction manual, Foscam should stay on ebay because that's where they should belong!!Sorry on the harsh words because consumer should be warned. As for those who wonders what other better camera available out there, here are couple that I highly recommended since our office and I have both now:1. Cavalry IPC10010 Pan & Tilt High Resolution Indoor Wireless IP/Network Camera (Black) - Compatible with Android and iOS - This is by far the best one I recommend. Our office replace all of our cameras to this one. You can set this camera up in probably less than 5 minutes, picture quality is great, 2 way voice sounds good too, and great Wi-Fi range distance.2. Dropcam Pro Wi-Fi Wireless Video Monitoring Camera - I got this last year for my home due to a yahoo review and this camera is as good as the Cavalry in terms of image quality and ease of setup. However, this camera cost a lot more at $199 + monthly cloud service. I would probably buy the Cavalry if it was available earlier.By the way, based on other reviewers who wrote negative reviews on the Foscam either got called working for the competition or their reviews all turned into not helpful. It makes you wonder is Amazon reviews even legit anymore... Companies like Foscam should simply focus on improving their products instead of spending their time on writing fake reviews.Anyways, buy at your own risk.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title":

Prader-Willi is a genetic disorder - people with PWS have an insatiable appetite and cannot control themselves around food.  If you came to our home you would find our all the food in our house under lock and key.My wife and I wanted to leave our 12 year old PWS child alone for a bit, but wanted the security of being able to watch the kitchen to make sure she did not eat (even with the food under lock and key).  It was very easy to set up and configure.  I already have a Synology NAS, so I connected the camera and set it up to record when it identified movement.Little did I know that this would also catch our 9 year old son trying to take the laptop up to his room after his bed time.  As you can see from the video, I did not hide the camera and he knew right where it was located.

The \"most helpful critical reviewer\" makes a very valid point, and if that problem is persisting then heed his advice, but it is one that many of the people who negatively reviewed this camera are not coming into contact with.I purchased this camera for home security purposes and as far as I am concerned it performs flawlessly. The live feed, motion detection, infrared functionality, silent alarm system (as well as the SMTP mail server functionality), free DDNS service, and FTP upload all work as intended. The main reason that I'm docking a single star for this device is because the setup can be excruciating; a reboot of the device is required following every major change made to its function, and if you're enabling all of the above settings like I did, you'll be rebooting this device many times during setup. The device is also slow to connect to a wireless network - the instructions suggest waiting up to a minute for it to connect properly before attempting to access it - but once this waiting period is over it responds rapidly and as it should.The main problem with this device seems to be the fact that its webUI is not very user friendly. This is true to some extent, but once you start meandering into the realm of do-it-yourself home security, some tech knowledge should be a given. Docking stars for an item too complicated for you to use seems somewhat foolish; the functionality still exists, but because the users here seem to be unable to delve into it they are saying it's a lousy product, which is untrue. This also applies for firmware upgrades. Yes you are required to upgrade two sets of firmware for this camera to get it to work as best it can, but this is no different than updating drivers on a computer hardware, or installing regular updates on a PC. As time goes by firmwares age and need to be replaced, this is a fact of the technology age we live in. I would be upset with a product that DIDN'T require you to update firmware out of the box, because this means, among other things, that they've likely stopped updating the firmware, and the functionality of the device is not being optimized.I have also read reviews that complain about the DDNS service offered to you through the device, claiming that they felt it was unsafe. Registering a DDNS is not unsafe in and of itself, primarily because knowing about the DDNS does not give somebody access to your home network any more than knowing your IP address does. This is also ironic, because the DDNS functionality is probably one of the easier things about this camera to configure, yet the people here having difficulty configuring the camera were upset about its inclusion. However, accessing this camera via the provided DDNS is not the only way to do so remotely, because as anybody who has registered a DDNS knows, it simply reroutes a customized web address to your IP address. I use another DDNS that I already had registered to access my cameras, and simply leave the one that came included with the camera deactivated. All of the remote functionality is exactly the same.I mean no offense to other reviewers, but I felt that my experience with the camera needed to be cataloged. If you are technology impaired, this might not be the camera for you as so many of these other reviews have experienced first hand. If, however, you are fully capable of managing your own home network and router via a webUI and understand the basics of port forwarding, I'm confident you'll be able to unravel the mystery that is the FOSCAM FI8910W, assuming their quality control issue has been reigned in (having not come across that issue myself, I can't comment on it here).", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Poor video quality and unreliable connection", "Author": "Romotive", "ReviewID": "R2QKZD6W0R5CM8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The video quality is bad and the camera is constantly disconnecting from my network.

Which you have to do for any IP Cam you wish to access outside of your home for those that don't know what a port-forward is.To be sure I was getting the better device I order 2 of this Foscam Wireless Cams Foscam FI8910W Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with Two-Way Audio and 1 TENVIS JPT3815W Wireless IP Pan/Tilt/ Night Vision Internet Surveillance Camera Built-in Microphone With Phone remote monitoring as well.

I bought these to place outdoors in a Foscam outdoor dome and I could barely connect to either FOSCAM cams. Tenvis connects all the time, changing or setting up WIFI on the Tenvis in the advanced view is \"Simple Stupid\" if you have a laptop or phone and you have connected to wifi you will know what to do it with the Tenvis. It's is called an IP CAM for a reason. Most people buying want the option to view these cams remotely or at the very least set them up on their WIFI network with ease.The Tenvis has a better UI - User Interface for actually viewing the cam than the FOSCAM, once again simple stupid. People that buy loads of IP Cams do not need bloatware or GIGs of software just to access their cam FOSCAM ships a big CD with loads of software but that does not justify the price and the crappy device.Initialization: When you send power to a device and the time it takes that device to power-up and be ready for action. FOSCAM slow, one of the 2 FOSCAM cams I got took sometimes over 5 mins just to get discovered on the network after it's rotationsAs far as specs go. They are identical in terms of features Tenvis more so with the actual working DNS server that lets you view your cam from outside your network without paying for a third-party DNS.I am ending this review with this, I am actually returning both FOSCAM cams and getting 4 Tenvis cameras for my house.

Like most people who buy a wifi IP cam, my intent was to connect it to my home network via our wifi network.  We wanted to use it in our twin daughters' room as a video baby monitor.First, because the product description did not mention that it came with a wall mount, I bought one that I did not need.  The one that comes standard with this camera is quite nice with adjustable angle to your preference, depending upon how high you end up mounting it on the wall.  Hence, I will have to go through the hassle of returning the one that I purchased separately.  I wish the product description had mentioned the wall mount.After I installed the camera on the wall and got it plugged in, I thought the biggest challenges were behind me.  Surely, setting up a wifi camera would be simple, or so I thought.  I opened up the \"Quick Start\" manual, which turned out to be a big lie, and the beginning of probably a 90-minute ordeal.  The application that it told me to start on my computer opened to a blank screen--not a darn thing to tell me anything that I had done right, wrong, or indifferent.  After lots of head scratching and online research, I came to the conclusion that it must be showing a blank screen because the application was not finding a webcam connected to the network.  How could this be?  I have a wifi network that works great for everything else.  I then determined, after much painful laboring through a poorly written \"Quick Start\" manual and Foscam website that in order to set the camera up on wifi, one must first set it up as a wired connection, and then configure it for wifi.  This was utter nonsense to me.  If a person wanted to operate a camera on wifi, then WHY would he first have to connect it wired?!?  This would be like buying a car, only to find out that you have to push it home before you can drive it.  I was dumbfounded.  Then, after more laboring through the \"Quick Start\" manual and more web searching, I found out about a feature that many routers have called WPS, which allows for easy connection of wifi devices without having to go through the painful online setup.  After getting into my router control panel on my computer (with no help from Foscam, of course), I was able to turn this feature on and get my router to connect to the camera automatically.  Thank heavens, as connecting my camera via hardwire in able to eventually get to wifi would have probably led to me returning this camera.Once connected to the network, getting it working should have been a snap.  Wrong again!  It was far from intuitive, and the manual was of little help to me.  Eventually, though, I got it working.Now the fun part, I thought.  I got to set up the iPhone app, which is how I really intended to use this camera--as a video baby monitor.  I followed the instructions to find the app that had the icon like the one they showed in the manual.  Great, I thought.  I was rated only 2 stars by users.  That should have been my first clue.  The app was incredibly cryptic to understand and set up.  When I finally got it working, I discovered that it offered NO AUDIO FEED, even though the camera does have 2-way audio.  Incredible miss!  So, I had it in me to look for a better app that would work with the camera.  I did find an outstanding app that supports this model of Foscam and also offers 2-way audio capability, such that you can listen AND talk.  Yes, you can talk into your phone, and it will transmit the audio to the camera wherever you have it located.  Very cool.  The name of the app that I purchased from the App Store is LiveCams Pro, and it was $3.99, a small price to pay to make this camera work the way it was supposed to work in the first place.As I have it configured, we must be on our wifi network in order to use the iPhone app.  There is a way to set it up to work on 3G coverage, if you are outside your wifi range, but there were 3 reasons I did not go through the ordeal to configure this.  First, it was complicated and difficult, as I read through it.  Second, I have a secured wifi network, and I like the idea of people needing access to our network before they can view the video feed of my girls in their room.  Third, since we are using this as a video baby monitor, we will always be home and connected to wifi when using it.  There is really no practical reason that we would ever need to connect via 3G.  Do know, however, that you can configure it that way if you so desire.Importantly, I have to say that the camera itself is impressive.  It pans silently, has good audio pickup (for listening), and transmits audio from out iPhones to the camera (when we speak into our iPhones) clearly.  The infrared lights work amazingly well in pitch darkness to make everything perfectly visible.  When you turn on the lights, a light sensor turns off the infrared lights, and you are left with great full-color video feed.In the end, we are happy with this product, but the road from purchase to full operation was painful.

However; a big improvement over the written instructions.Excellent pan and tilt range.Nice long DC cord for power.Includes a flexible mounting bracket.Easy to put together and in service.DHCP is now off by default.If you know the camera name or IP you can just use that in the browser to get to the camera and not mes with the IP camera tool.[update]Works fine with my Kindle in 'phone mode so should work with any Android device.[\\update]The Bad:Needs DC, there is no battery option. There are battery to AC converters but they cost more than the Foscam.Takes up bandwidth on your 2.4GHz network--apparently will not work on the 5GHz band.No way to program a scan. e.g. start at the bottom of the stairs scan up then scan horizontally down a hall or even just limit the scan travel. (A little unfair given the price price point.)Need to get the camera running to determine the driver to use.The Ugly:No zoom (again given the price point not really expected.)Plastic mounting bracket appears frigale.To avoid power cord problems and eliminate the drain on WiFI bandwidth you can run Power over Ethernet cable to the camera. You need to run one line in any case.[update]The SW supplied with the camera is limited and you need something like the Blue Iris Professional - Supports Many IP Camera Brands Including Foscam and Agasio, Zone Motion Detection, H.264 Compression Recording, E-mail And SMS Text Messaging Alerts! software to get all the features you would like to have.Audio on non-IE browsers requires a obscure plug with limited compatibility.As the camera gains up (IR mode) the screen blinks and gets grainier.IR limited to ~100m to see something is there and ~50M to see what.Outside in bright sun you can see a large object (garbage truck) as recognizable at ~200M, and that something is there at 1000M.

To prevent this, you have to go through a somewhat complicated process of singing up with a (free) DNS service like no-ip.biz.  then you have to configure the camera to work with that service.  I'm neither and expert nor an idiot and it took me a full day to get everything right.The IR function is fair at best - you won't get any worthwhile detail in near darkness.The camera runs all the time but only captures video during an alarm but you need an FTP server to upload the actual video so while you can watch it real time on your portable device you won't be capturing the full video, only snapshots.The alarm function requires going into the software to deactivate unless you want hundreds of photos being emailed constantly of your dog wandering around the house.  There really should be a desktop icon for the alarm function to quickly turn on/off.Cord on the AC adapter is way too short to mount the camera up high on the wall where it is less noticeable to potential thieves.Conclusion:  It's an excellent deal for <$100 considering not too many years ago a camera of this capability and quality would have cost many multiples of its current price.

It doesn't claim to be a high resolution camera, and it isn't, so can I ding the product a star for having such a poor quality picture?  The picture quality is pretty bad.  Once there is distance from the lens, you may have trouble recognizing faces.  Whether or not this camera is for you, depends on your needs.  To use as a general web cam, it's really great.  For  surveillance, it's a bit lacking.Here is a brief list of the pros and cons:Pros:* Decent built in software, able to access via a browser, phone, tablet, etc (although it's not sized for a smaller screen)* Works with a lot of Android apps and open source ones for the PC* Respectable price* Remote Pan and Tilt, 2 way audio, infrared \"lights\"* Motion alerts (FTP and email)* Viewing over the internet* Can setup users to control who has access to camera* Video feed* Wifi or ethernet* Lot's of other smaller but interesting options in the softwareCons:* Poor picture quality.  Very grainy, with or without infrared.  Unless you know the person in the image, you may have trouble identifying them.* Any motion occurring during the picture will be blurred* Motion alerts go off all the time due to sunlight in the windows* Video can't be sent via alerts* Video is slow, perhaps 10 frames per sec.I bought an open box version and it's probably worth the cost at that price.  If I get another camera, I may spring for an HD version, perhaps with zoom.UPDATE: 12/20/2013I've been using the camera a lot and the primary reason I bought it was for the alerts.  The alerts are broken and broken badly.  They simply do not work.  On the lowest sensitivity, in 2 days, the camera sent 19,000 images to me.  Only about 200 were valid alerts.  I can't filter 19,000 images manually.  Also my email can't handle that many images, it gets overwhelmed.  I can't send them to an FTP server, since it bogs down with that many files.

On the strength of that, I recently purchased a 3 pack, that also came with the (surprisingly large) 9 dB antennas.  The new cameras (using either antenna) would not work in network conditions that the old camera found acceptable.  To make a long debugging story short, I put one of the new cameras adjacent to the old camera and called Foscam support.  They did a reasonable job of remote debugging, including copying the setup parameters from the working camera to the new camera, but had to admit defeat.  (Both of my tech support calls were promptly handled by competent personnel, but were problematic for connection quality: background noise in one case, combined with pronounced Indian accent in another.)  My opinion is that this batch of FI8910W's had some manufacturing defect. Interestingly, when packing to return the cameras, I found my old camera's box was a millimeter or so larger than the new ones.For the geeks among you, the problem was associated with network bandwidth, but not in a simple way.  The new cameras worked OK when deep inside the house, but would fail when put on a windowsill.  It was not simply signal strength, since my Airport Utility would be reporting \"Excellent\" signal strength for the connection to the camera.  I even purchased an Airport Express device to extend the network, and, while within a few feet of that device, the camera would work OK away from the window yet fail when on the sill.  To explain what I mean by \"failure\", if after a reboot of the camera, it was put in a lateral pan mode from the web browser interface, it would cease showing video before it had completed the lateral scan, and would subsequently reboot itself.  These symptoms were not as prominent if the camera was put in QVGA mode (320x240) or the low-light IR exposure mode was in force.

Devices with the same set of features but marketed for baby-cam use seem to run 2-3x as much, so the price made the Foscam Fl8910w seem like a real bargain.But with all the controversy about the reviews of this camera, I approached this purchase with a good deal of wariness.Some quick disclaimers, I'm a computer professional, and I have configured more than my fair share of web-enabled devices.That said, I found this network camera straight-forward to setup and get going.  It works as advertised with two-way audio quality well within the acceptable range, good video quality, and apparently free DynDNS service.The camera needs to be hooked up via Ethernet for it's initial configuration.  While this is a slight hassle, it makes getting the WiFi settings very easy.I'm a Mac user, and I usually expect a bit of hassle during setup.  I was surprised to see that the included software CD has a Mac setup utility.  I skipped using it since I hate cluttering up my machine with one-time use (possibly gimpy) software.  So I did the configuration \"manually\".  Once the camera was hooked up on my network, I found the address it was assigned on my router, and the remainder of the configuration is done on the built-in webserver.  I could immediately see the camera was working, and the pan/tilt functions performed as expected.  I had to setup the WiFi settings, and I checked out the dynamic DNS settings.The device comes with a dynDNS name assigned out of the myfoscam.org domain, which appears to be free and setup to work with the camera automagically.  I also enabled a third-party DynDNS service through no-ip.com, which I created an account and setup for the purpose of hooking to this camera.  Both seem to function fine, and I get the correct address through both services.Finally, uPNP wasn't working through my (Apple Airport) wireless router, so I added a port-forward/redirect for the camera to the network configuration on the router.Total setup time: 30 mins, including time to find and configure an iOS client.The image quality is very good, probably better than I've seen on any baby monitor, and the audio quality is clear and loud in both directions.  There is some \"fisheye\" distortion in the image, but I think that's a function of trying to get the widest coverage with the lens possible, and I can't really fault them for it.  The image is certainly good enough to see what's happening in a nursery.  The IR lights allow monitoring the room in the dark, and work extremely well.So I can say as a *real* customer who has never having dealt with Foscam support, I'm a happy camper so far.  Time will tell if this camera is reliable, but so far so good.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Foscam FI8910W IP Camera", "Author": "Flying4905", "ReviewID": "RY4WECJ7XLA4E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK - I'll try to keep this brief and hopefully will not cover too much of stuff that others have already covered. Here are my two cents:Camera and software is for the most part excellent (for the price).  It does the job as advertised.The setup to get the camera working on your local wireless network literally will take less than five minutes (even if you are not computer savvy).The setup to get the camera working OVER THE INTERNET can have some pitfalls if you get sidetracked - I'm going to give you some tips to avoid getting sidetracked - First - DO NOT try to follow the Youtube instructions, I think from Awkward Hamster - it's likely your router is not the same as his, and it's easy to get messed up trying to follow his instructions.  Another thing is this (and it's a big one) - DO NOT use the DynDNS service that everybody talks about - it's either no longer free, or they have become very good at hiding the free part of their service.  Something AwkwardHamster does not mention is that Foscam offers FREE DDNS service for three years, and it sets up completely automatically through the camera software - TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS.Here's how to avoid problems and get a quick internet connection setup for your FOSCAM camera - Two Ways:  One, there is a setup video on the CD that comes with the camera.  Follow this to the letter and it is very easy to set up the camera (although they push the DynDNS service for some reason, which baffles me, because you get three years of Foscam DNS FREE OF CHARGE). Also you have to suppress laughing at the horrible accent of the instructor.Secondly, if you can follow the written setup instructions that come with the camera ( I actually recommend this method ) - and they aren't too difficult - these actually walk you step by step through the entire setup process for the camera.And yes, once you do it a couple of times it is all easy as pie and it does work as advertised...Now, the caveat - I have a fair amount of computer experience and would probably be considered an expert by 90% of the computer public - but I tried setting up my camera system according to the Youtube videos, and ended up:  Crashing new Windows 8 computer (had to do a Restore on it); crashing Belkin N dual band router (had to do a Restore to Factory Default); did some goofy stuff to my DSL modem re: the internet connection - and a couple of other weird things...Either follow the video setup instructions or the written setup instructions that come with the camera and you will be fine. Don't be intimidated and if you get stuck or something goes wrong just keep trying and you will get it to work (I got really messed up and just kept working it until I got it up and running, I never called Foscam help or any of that)...", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fun watching the dog and cat fight", "Author": "James Whitmoyer", "ReviewID": "R3KFCCMQT2MPBG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was really easy to set up, and we did the whole internet connection thing.

The method of theft was to ring up a sale, and if the customer paid cash with exact change and did not request a receipt, the employee would later pocket the money and cancel the sale.  This way there was no record of the transaction and the cash drawer would reconcile at the end of the day.As others have mentioned, the foscam camera was incredibly easy to install.  Just attach a ethernet line, look at the router to find the IP address assigned by the router, and use a web browser to configure.  The camera can then be mounted anywhere near a power outlet.  My camera is mounted about six feet above the cash register, which gives me enough scope to monitor a transaction to make sure that cash makes it into the drawer.I have a 24x7 ubuntu computer that has an ftp server.  The camera was set to store to this server (FTP Server Settings) and to upload every second after motion was triggered (Alarm Service Settings).  I wrote a simple shell script to archive the activity on a daily basis and remove files older than a month.  To review the day's activity (this takes maybe 10 minutes, depending on the amount of activity), I use the ubuntu command \"feh -D 0.25 [files]\".  To monitor the area in realtime, I use totem \"[camera ip address]/videostream.asf?user=admin&pwd;=\" rather than a web browser, because I found that the web browser uses much more cpu.There is room for improvement.  Sound is pretty horrible.

I like to think I can figure out most tech things if given enough time and I have Google available to help troubleshoot my questions. 2.  If it didn't work, I knew it would be an easy return to Amazon.I ordered 3 cameras and also ordered Foscam Blue Iris software.  I used the install disc that came with Camera #1.  It was really simple.  I followed the instructions and it worked both with my ethernet and with my wireless network.  Changed the port settings per the instructions and no problems there either.  My IP is static, so I didn't have to go through those issues.My only cons were I could not get it to work with Chrome, which is my preferred browser.  Worked fine with all three cams on IE.  This won't really be an issue in the future as I'm using Blue Iris to monitor it from my PC and then IP Cam Viewer ($3.99) on my android applications.  Blue Iris is not really that intuitive at first, but the help section really lays out all you need. Although this is not a review of that software, I bring it up because it is basically my interface, recording, viewing, etc., so it obviously is key to having a good experience with the cameras.The video quality is good in both light and dark.  You can adjust a lot of the settings for how choppy it will be, brightness, contrast, etc.  It is more than enough for me considering the price.

I had to cover it with electrical tape to keep it from lighting up the wall behind it.* The \"click\" of the IR cut filter is pretty loud when it switches from day to night mode. My kids noticed this right away when turning their room light on or off.* The camera takes a little over 30 seconds to reboot after just about any settings change. Quite annoying!INFO:* Requires direct wired connection for initial setup before you can activate wireless* Audio is a little scratchy - don't expect high-quality audio recordingsI downloaded IP Cam Viewer Free so I can monitor both cameras at once from my phone. It almost looks like a security system setup you see on TV. You have to pay for an upgrade to the application in order to receive/send audio, but it's a useful little tool if you just want to do a quick check-in. There are many available apps for both Android and iOS that you can use to monitor the camera.Unlike others here, I did not need to call customer support to set up the cameras. Mine were shipped with the latest firmware (actually later than the firmware advertised on their website) and full initial setup took about 10 minutes per camera and then about 30 minutes of tweaking the preset locations, image settings, etc. after placing it in its permanent location.4.5 stars (rounded up to 5)", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera, requires some ability to work with computers / network, or ability to watch youtube videos / read comments", "Author": "Gadget Lover \"I love hi-tech gadgets\"", "ReviewID": "R19CENP56G84I9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Update - Seems I have been screwed by Foscam warranty service.At the direction of Foscam US, I mailed ObservEye (one of their official Foscam warranty providers) a defective Foscam FI8190W, with insurance and tracking, to your address in Monroe on 7/3/13.

It appears they have now removed their phone number from their public website as well.A very shoddy way to do business.******************************************original review below*************I recently purchased one of these cameras during a lightning sale, and it worked so well that I purchased 4 more, for a total of 5 cameras for a couple of properties I own.  These are bar none the most amazing, best cameras I have ever used.  I have used closed circuit cameras, various earlier generation brand cameras (including a finicky Linksys cam that worked 50% of the time and cost twice as much).The resolution of the cameras are amazing. I am able to watch from PC, iPhone / iPad, and my Android devices, anywhere, with near 100% reliability. As long as you have data, it should work flawlessly.  Just amazing.However, since these cameras rely on your home wireleness network working well, as well as a small amount of effort to set up a dynamic DNS (I used no-ip.com for free and it works great) so you can view the cameras outside your home - DO NOT BUY / INSTALL these cameras if you are: stupid, lazy, have no idea what WIFI is, what an IP Address is, OR even knew what the admin page of your router is.  Many of the complaints here are due to people lacking some basic understanding / expertise around home networks / ip addresses.  IF you fall into this group of people, either HIRE a TRUSTED person to do it for you (a close friend / family member who knows more about computers than you do), or outsource this to the Geek Squad (as much as I hate them).Here are the steps I followed to install the cameras:1. DO NOT install the software from the CD. I can find no good reason to do so.  Instead, I plugged the camera into my router via ethernet cable, and plugged in the power cord.  1.a  Once the camera is booted and on the network via ethernet, log into your router admin page (eg 192.168.0.1) or something like that - and look up the IP address of the camera (eg. 192.168.0.101)2. On your browser - type in the IP address of the camera (eg: 192.168.0.101)  2.a  This will bring up the camera view / set up page.  It will ask for a user / password.  The default is \"admin\" for user, with password field blank.3. Once you get past the log in page, depending on the firmware, it will show the video immediately. You can pan, tilt, and scan (no zoom).  You can also go to the settings page (Device management) and set the various parameters for your network.  3.a  Turn on wireless settings if you are going to use this on wifi (most people will, since these cameras are going to be in remote locations away from a router / switch).  3.b  set up users and passwords (recommended to add password to Admin, and create additional users for \"operators\" who can't change camera settings).  Note - once you change password, the camera will reboot, and ask you for the password immediately!!  Don't forget the passwords!!  3.c  set up a unique HTTP Port (I recommend a single value 8000 - 8999).  If you don't know what this is, please consult a friend who knows about port forwarding, or google it, watch Youtube videos, etc., about the camera set up.  3.c.1  Once you have set up a unique HTTP port, the camera will reboot.  When you log back to the camera, you MUST add the port to the IP address - eg:  192.168.0.101:8000  .  Without the PORT # to the IP address, you WILL NOT find the camera!!!  I suspect a lot of people trying to set this up don't do this right and then come here and complain about the camera, when it's their own fault.4.  Go to No-ip.com, create an account, set up an alias (eg.  myaddress.no-ip.org) that you will be using from outside the home to watch the camera.  This is 100% free and works great.  I recommend a small donation to no-ip.com if you like to thank them for their service.  4.a  Once this is done, go to the DDNS service settings of your camera and enter it there.  Camera will reboot and show either the DDNS settings were successful or failed.5. Once wireless is turned on the camera, disconnect the ethernet cable.  5.a  Log into the router, and look up the wireless IP Address (denoted by foscaxxxx_1 in the device name)  5.b  log into the wirelss IP address with the PORT # - eg: 192.168.0.102:8080 (not the ethernet IP Address!!)6. If you are successful thus far, then set a static IP address for your Foscam to guarantee reliability  6.a Using a linksys router, I set my static IP for the wireless FOScam as 192.168.0.199, for example.  6.b  After this is done (saved the settings on router, etc), turn off the camera, router, and then turn everything back on to allow the static IP address to take effect.  6.c Log into the router to check that the static IP address is working.  Test by going to the static IP on your browser - eg:  192.168.0.199:8000, and log into the camera to make sure it is working.7. If everything looks good thus far, then log into the no-ip address to make sure everything works:  7.a  Log into  myaddress.no-ip.org:8000 (your alias and your port #) to make sure everything works. It should if you understand and have followed my directions above.8. Voila - done, enjoy!!!Some additional notes:1. Internet Explorer sucks, don't use it (I have IE 9 and the active X control kept crashing my IE).2. Install Chrome, and use it.  To do so, use the \"Server Push Mode\" and everything works great.  Use Chrome for everything if you can, ditch Internet Explorer (saying this as I have to use IE for work and I grudgingly do so).3. If you own an iPhone / iPad, the free Cam Viewer app works great for this device.  Many other cam apps work also.If you were able to follow the very SIMPLE (yes simple) directions above, and get it to work, kudos.  If what you read was gibberish, DO NOT buy this camera, or hire someone to install the camera for you!!!One thing to keep in minde - who ever installs the camera for you with the network settings can view your camera if they want, any time, any where!!  So if you do this, make sure you make them teach you how to log into the camera ADMIN page, and change the passwords for the admin user, and any other users that are set up, so only you can log in and view the camera.This is pretty simple stuff, if you have any desire to learn about basic home networking, can watch some Youtube videos that go through this stuff, read some online forums, or just can RTFM!!!This camera is amazing.

The people having problems with setup are baffling because I followed the directions exactly and it worked. I read reviews that said not to use the installation CD that comes with it but I thought I'd try that first to see what the issues were. I plugged in the camera and plugged it into my router with the supplied ethernet cable. I popped the CD in the drive, navigated to IPCamSetup.exe and ran it. It immediately found the IP of the Camera and prompted me to login. The default username and password are in the manual. After I logged in, I selected which browser I wanted to use and POOF it's connected and the picture appears. This took maybe 3 minutes. The amount of control you have is amazing. From vertical and horizontal patrol to scheduling recording times to motion sensing, sound sensing, 2 way audio, email alerts... the list goes on and on. After it was setup as hard wired, I followed the directions to set it up wirelessly by going to the device manager and selecting the wireless LAN settings tab. (as the instructions tell you) Clicked scan (as the directions said) and it found the SSID of my router. (as the instructions said it would) I simply entered the share key and submit. The camera rebooted and once again... POOF, it's now working wirelessly.

They don't lie! This thing is great.We have 2 iphones and an ipad, we use foscam pro to access the cameras from those devices (universal app). It gives full control of the pan and tilt and other settings on with the camera. It also transmits audio and allows you to talk through the camera; it doesn't have a great speaker, but our 2 year old seems to understand us well enough when talking through it. The app cost a few bucks (more than what I spend on most apps) but I knew how much a video baby monitoring system cost and we were still way under the cost of that route. As a side note, the app is a resource hog and will drain your battery. It will run in the background transmitting audio if you have it enabled. This really hasn't been an issue for me, it bugs my wife but she lets the app run forever.The setup can be a little frustrating. Some things that help, assign it a static IP address so that if the router resets, it won't assign a different ip. We use port 8090 instead of 80; it seems to improve the reliability of our internet and its safer if you decide to set up port forwarding. I haven't gone through that step yet, but will get to it at some point. Follow the directions and it should go well. Be sure to give at least a minute (60 sec) if you are trying to have it list available networks.The infrared is excellent, very clear in our baby's room. The glow of the red lights around the camera do not seem to bother her or prevent her from falling asleep. It is 10 times better than any baby monitoring system my friends use. As soon as I show them the clarity of the picture, they want to know exactly where to buy cause their sold. Happy monitoring!<Edit>I set up the port forwarding a week ago through my router - much easier than I expected it to be. On the port forwarding page on your router setup, you need to enter the port that it will be incoming on and type in the static ip address you have assigned to the camera. I used a random password generator to maximize the security of the password and changed it prior to setting up the port forwarding (hopefully this will increase the security). This now allows me to check in during nap time to see whats going on and we can move the camera to the main floor while away so we can check in on the house.Really loving this camera, no it is not HD, but for our needs its great.

The camera itself is a great concept, its easy to install the basics for this purpose and get it up and running.  Wi-Fi is a piece of cake to setup and the assembly is just plugging in and screwing he antenna in and mounting where desired.The infrared aspect of this camera is crucial because babies need dark rooms to sleep in and \"night vision\" of other cameras always leaves a lot to be desired.  One tip is that you must have a very dark room with no bright spots for this to activate the IR lamps and so black outs on windows is a must.  The image is very clear though once activated.  Very happy with this aspect.The controls on this are a snap to use and very responsive and you can aim it anywhere and invert the image and controls etc incase you have it mounted upside down on the ceiling like we do.For actual monitoring we use Live Cam Pro from the iTunes app store on the Ipods and Ipads and the camera has instructions for a web based utility for use on Pc's.  Live Cam Pro is a great App to use.So you ask, having said all that, why 2 stars **.  Well there have been some problems with the cameras.  We are actually on our third replacement camera.  They are a great concept with great features but they are still very buggy even the latest version as of this review and customer service is a bit of a bear.  Here's some of the problems we have had with them.The audio is not great, there is a constant feedback humming which occurs on all devices, Ipods, Ipads and Pcs.  We spoke to Foscam about this and replaced the camera but the new one had the exact same problem and actually so does this third camera so I am not sure what they are achieving by having me get the camera replaced.  So the audio is not usable unfortunately especially when your trying to hear small subtle noises from a dozing baby.  Don't even consider the talk back feature as it results in an unstoppable squelch.The bigger problem was that the cameras were constantly rebooting themselves like there was a power outage.  I put them on different circuits and even connected it to a UPS battery backup to ensure it wasn't a power glitch here and it wasn't.  Half the time after reboots, it would have a new IP address which required reconfiguring the apps on a daily basis (sometimes in the middle of the night when baby is crying).  This requires you turning your pc on in the middle of the night to use the camera app to find the new IP address of the camera.  The other problem was that I would have to pan the camera etc to reposition back to where it was watching the baby before and this woke up the baby.  Sometimes on a reboot the camera would become stuck in the up position clicking trying to to go more up and I would have to enter the nursery to power cycle it to stop this and the clicking also wakes the baby.The biggest problem though was customer service.  There answer was always return the camera.  Now after 60 days from the initial purchase, you have to pay for shipping every time which has to be traceable like UPS and hence about $12.  So your paying $12 a pop for this.  Secondly I had to buy a replacement camera before returning the original camera so that I had a camera at all times and the replacement camera was more expensive.  Now you would think Foscam would refund the cost of the replacement camera, but no they refunded $11 less than the cost of the original camera resulting on me being another $23 out so I am $35 total out for every replacement.  Add that into your purchase price!!!  Subsequent to the replacements which still had the same problems, I did my own research and found some solutions myself which if Foscam had bothered to tell me would have saved them the replacement and me $35 a pop.  (audio still no good unfortunately and I have the latest rehash of the camera)So here I am with camera #3 hoping third times a charm but for much more than the original purchase price.  If I wasn't already invested in this camera (ITunes apps purchase etc) I would wish to have gone with a different camera or at least a different company.Good luck.Update 12/9/12:Well third time is not a charm.  After a month of \"ok\" use it has started resetting itself constantly like all the rest of the cameras.  This means I have to keep switching on my laptop to use the IP tool to see what the new IP address is of the camera before I can use it on the iPad and iPod.  A real pain at bedtime.  I don't feel like wasting more money returning this for an obviously defective product line.  Very dissappointed.

I don't regret that so far.PROS:Set up was easier than some reviews led me to believe. From a Mac OS perspective, the included CD only had a very simple utility that finds the IP address of the camera. There are plenty of other ways for the computer-savvy to find that address as well. Plug the camera into your router, type that IP into your web browser and you get full controls. From there, you can enable the wireless, turn on the motion alarm, etc.- The quality is surprisingly good. I generally leave it at the 320px resolution because the motion is smoother.- When the camera moves and tilts, it's very quiet. Since like I said we're using it for a baby monitor, that's important.- There are numerous iOS and Android apps out there. Even searching \"Foscam\" in the store will bring up plenty of results.- I haven't had to deal with support yet, but Foscam's website has a lot of good information in their user forums. It's a popular enough camera that there are a lot of other forums out there with people talking about them and working through issues.CONS:I can't get audio to work through a web browser, unless you're using Windows with Internet Explorer. This is due to Foscam (for some reason) using Videolan's lapsed web plugins which I just can't get to work. Streaming the camera directly from Videolan's open-source VLC app will give you sound though on Mac, Windows, or Linux. Since I don't normally need to use the controls for the camera, I usually just stream it that way. I also downloaded a couple iOS apps that have both sound and controls.- There is a delay with audio of about a second. How you feel about that probably depends on how you're going to use the camera.Overall, I haven't had it for too awfully long but my impression is very good.", "Date": "September 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good basic IP camera, software is junk", "Author": "Brent V", "ReviewID": "R1155M3SJXUJXS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good camera if you just need minimal functionality.

It works beautifully.  Download the $5.99 App in the Apple Store and you can view your camera remotely.  The name of the App is Foscam Pro made by Logic Consulting LLC.Works great with macs too.  I actually used my mac to set it up.  Pop the CD in and look for the Mac OSX folder and follow the instructions.  Basically, you drag and drop the IP Camera Tool app into your Applications Folder.  The IP Camera Tool will scan your network and look for the camera and will show you the camera's IP address.  You then use that IP Address to configure your iPhone/iPad app.  Note that when the camera is unplugged it picks up a new IP Address (have not figured out how to give it a static IP address yet).  You use that IP address to configure the App and you can monitor your baby and your babysitter whether you are in a different room in the house or out and about running errands around town.The camera has a built in mic so you can hear the baby remotely through your iPhone/iPad (quality is decent).

Look for that product and you will see that I did own this product because I posted the same review for it. I just know that more people buy the single camera and I wanted them to find my review. I hope this helps with your decision making!For the price of these cameras, they work pretty well. I didn't have any issues setting them up but I am an IT professional (bachelor's degree in CIT) and I am very familiar with networking. I thought the included instructions were good enough to allow most people to set these up without assistance but if you have trouble, there are many how-to articles that can be easily found online. The cameras have a very solid construction. I bought two of these in a set with the larger 9dB antennas included. I ended up not using the larger antennas - well because they are far larger than I expected them to be (probably 8-9 inches long). I have a ~1,300 square foot home and didn't have any issues with signal when using the standard antennas that are about 1/3 the size of the larger ones. The two way audio on the cameras was only OK. It seemed to be better for listening than talking through the camera - which was fine for me because one of the cameras was intended use was just for a baby monitor. The audio didn't work so well though when the IR was on. The IR lights must generate a signal interference that is picked up by the mic on the camera because when the IR was on, there was a constant noise when listening through the camera. The image quality over all was excellent in both day and night modes. The only issue I had was the IR is activated automatically by a photo sensor that detects the amount of ambient light present in the room. You can manually (through software)turn this off when it comes on automatically but I was not able to turn it on if the photo sensor detected too much light in the room and hadn't turned it on for you. This bothered me because at the in between level of the photo sensor turning on the IR mode for low light operation versus daylight operation, I was sure that I could have gotten a better image if I could have manually turned it on sooner. The biggest problem for me with these cameras was the FPS. This camera uses MJPEG for video compression. This method of compression is not efficient at all and creates very large file sizes. In order to view the feed remotely, this large file size has to be transmitted. I am not for sure if the large file sizes are truly the cause of the very low FPS I got on both cameras or if it was some other limitation but I am pretty certain that I wasn't getting the expected 15 FPS (VGA - 640x480 resolution) or the 30 FPS (QVGA - 320x240 resolution). I didn't have a way to measure my actual FPS but my video feeds were very jerky and more like time elapsed still images (which is actually what MJPEG is). I would guess that I was getting at best 1/2 the FPS that was advertised. I suspect that the transmittal of the large video size was also affecting the sound quality because so much bandwidth was consumed by the video that little was left for audio. These cameras also only work on up to wireless G networks that have a max 54Mpbs throughput. With all this said, even though I have rated these with 4 stars, I am returning them. I am replacing them with the Foscam FI8608W IP cams. These are the newer model in this lineup. They support H.264 video compression, which can reduce video file size by up to 80% over MJPEG. The FI8608W model also has wireless N support (600Mbps), a memory card slot that supports up to 32GB cards for recording, and it has a faster processor. I expect all of this to provide me with a significant improvement in both video, audio, and recording. The FI8608W models are ~$45 more though but I think that is justifiable with the enhancements. I forgot to mention, something that I wondered about the FI8910W model when I was thinking about ordering them was about the software for remote viewing. It is very functional and you can create three types of log on accounts for people that you want to allow to view/operate the cameras. You can have administrators, operators, and viewers. Admins can do anything. Operators can view the cameras and use the PTZ functions to adjust where the camera points. Viewers can just log in and see what the camera is currently pointing at. The software for the FI8910W does easily integrate with up to 9 cameras. The app IP Cam Viewer ($3.99 on the Apple App Store) from Robert Chou which is mentioned by several other reviewers really does work well for accessing the cameras.UPDATE:As I originally stated, I replaced these cameras with the FI8608W camers. I purchased them off from Amazon.com as well - so you can find my review of that camera online as well. Please read about my experience with the 8608 cameras before making your decision. The hardware for the 8608 is improved but the software was broken with the new firmware and web GUI interface.

If you want to use this inside one network (camera and viewing application) it works fine cabled.

Bottom line, I'm returning this camera.  If you're not very comfortable with things like port forwarding, DDNS, setting up static IP addresses, and firmware updates, this camera's setup is not for you.

It's worked flawlessly with my WiFi setup on an Airport Extreme router.Pros:* Streaming over the internet is fast -- use a web browser or mobile app* Tilt/Pan functions work great* There are a lot of good iPhone apps that work with the camera* Setup was pretty simple* User management is easy* It has IR lights and an IR filter for viewing at night* 2 way speakers allow you to hear audio from the camera and talk through the cam's speakersCons:\u00d7 The web interface is functional but really, really ugly -- avoid if you can. Use an app instead.\u00d7 The web interface is supposed to work with IE and Firefox, but the Firefox interface is somewhat broken.\u00d7 I went to the foscam website to see if there were any firmware updates -- they forced me to give them my email address with the disclaimer that I am agreeing to receive marketing materials as well as firmware download instructions. This really _really_ annoyed me and is why they lost 1 star. Not cool Foscam. There is no reason for you not to provide a direct download link. After signing up for the spam emails only _then_ did I find out there were no firmeware upgrades.

The only negative is the price, it's higher than other foscam-like camera, so when I needed a another WIFI ip cam, I set out to buy look at other options.  I tried two other ip cam, one is the lowest price.  This one the wifi range is probably one fifth of the Foscam, and the web interface is problematic, sometime I can connect to the GUI, but sometimes I have to power down the camera  to re-connect.  So that one went back.I bought a second one from the same company, but with IR-Cut feature, but this one also suffer the same problem with short range of WIFI, and the web interface is also sporatic, at few instances, i had to power down and restart before I can manage or view it again.The biggest problem with these two camera, is when viewing thru WIFI, the frame rate is about 2 frames per seconds, so when you pan or tile or when the subject moving, it's like watching a comic strip very bad lag.When I ping those two cameras it get 50% or higher lost packets.So, then I finally broke down and open my wallet for the 8910W from ebay, sorry Amazon, you did not have the PRIME on the item I needed at the time.  The new camera came in with nicer looking exterior shell, very quite when panning/tilting.  The range is equally good  as 8918, and reach much further than the other two previous camera.  I can monitor both WIFI cameras and both frame rate are acceptable, i say 10-15 per second.

You can control pan and tilt from your PC (or other device) as well as change the administrative settings (with a username/password.)The device can, on alert, send images to e-mail accounts or if you set up a FTP location, to a folder on a FTP drive.  The alert can be on motion and/or sound.  I have tried all of these options with success.  I have found for me that the e-mail on alert is best to my liking.  You get an alert and a picture as soon as a motion or sound triggers it.Another feature that takes a little more technical skill to set up is the ability to access the camera from any location on the internet.  The setup on the camera is fairly easily but on your router, you will need to modify settings to allow the camera to be accessible through the internet.  In normal operations, your router would block these type of access attempts as a security measure.  You can selectively allow allow open ports to access the camera and keep your LAN secure.  There are decent instructions in the manual that makes this setup easier.  I also tried this function and it works great as well.  It is very nice to be able to look over your house when you are away from home.The infrared works very well also for night pictures.The picture resolution is as stated in the specifications.  If you want a higher resolution image, you should look at the more expensive version of this camera.Last point is that there are several free apps on the apple store for the FOSCAM that allows you to view up to 8 cameras.  If you have an iPhone or iPad, these making viewing multiple cameras very nice and an improvement over using a browser.I have had the camera for about 6 weeks - I am pleased with the operations and functionality.

I'm technically competent, but not an IT professional. This is the first time I've logged into my wireless router since I set it up probably 8 years ago. To be fair, I lost one whole evening because I missed checking the port forwarding \"enable\" box on my router. Doh!I could have done this job entirely by referring to the product manual, which is actually pretty good. It is terse, you need to read and look at the illustrations carefully. Most of my problems were from misreading. (Like not noticing the check in the \"enable\" box. Still kicking myself over that one!)I had a hard time with the wireless setup, because I misread the instructions. So I went to the Foscam website for wireless setup [...], and read that the product does not work with 802.11/n wireless routing protocol.  Which is what my wireless router and everything that connects to it uses. I am happy to report that this is dead wrong. The camera works fine with 802.11/n protocol.If you read the reviews, the place people get stuck is at port forwarding. That was my biggest challenge too. I was lucky that I have a Linksys wireless router and the product manual has screenshots that exactly match my router setup screens. If you have a different router I see that Foscam has instructions for many popular brands at:[...]Here are some specific details to my installation, which may help those with similar systems. Our ISP is Time Warner. We have a cable modem hooked up to an old Linksys wireless router. Time Warner does not block ports. (At least in CA, as far as I can tell.) I did not have to set up port forwarding on my cable modem, I found some on-line instructions about double port forwarding that were a red herring. I don't think it is necessary or possible to set up port forwarding on a cable modem. I did have to set up port forwarding on my wireless router.I used the free Foscam DDNS with no problems. There is a label on the bottom of the camera with an IP address that you can access from any browser or phone. You have to follow the manual instructions to enable it, and set up a static IP. But it worked well for me. I did not need to buy a domain name from DynDDS or other third party. I can access and control the camera from any PC and from my smart phone. Pretty cool.Something I love about this camera is that when it is configured properly you can just unplug it and move it anywhere within the range of the wireless router. Want to watch the kids? The dog? The garage? No problem.Next steps for me are to figure out motion detector alarms and how to record video, preferably off site.

The picture was OK and perfectly acceptable considering that it is VGA resolution with a CMOS image sensor.  If the software was a nice as the hardware (again...considering the price for the hardware comment) I would have rated the camera 5 stars.  The problem came when I tried to really use the camera with my browser of choice (Firefox).I found the camera to work acceptably well with Internet Explorer.  The web interface for IE uses ActiveX for displaying the video.  It was pretty snappy and the video was OK.  When I tried the \"server push\" interface which is intended for use with other browsers  the camera \"bombed\"  Even though the computer and camera were plugged into the same 100MB network switch the user interface kept freezing up.  I tried this with multiple computers including a 3ghz quad core windows 7 box but the results were the same.  Sometimes when panning stopped the image would retain motion blur from the last frame sent (I think that they use MJPG downloads for video).  The \"killer problem\" with this device is that after  a short period of use, the video stops working all together and there is an icon of a  \"broken document with an X \" where the video should be.  Once this happens the device has to be rebooted to get it to work again.  I tried it on several computers with the same results so the problem was definitely with the camera.I contacted Foscam support and their technician logged onto my computer remotely and when I showed her the problem she said that the only way to fix it was to run the camera at 320X240 resolution or to use internet explorer.I really wish that this had worked out for me because I still like the camera design and ergonomics.  Sadly, I just boxed it up and returned it because I don't, won't, and can't run Internet explorer.

Over-night the camera worked well and I had a new-found insight into the nocturnal life of our cat (bathing, sleeping, occasionally running like crazy).The next morning, before work, I setup the camera to point out of a front window as I wanted to monitor the mailbox and various deliveries throughout the day. Once at work I connected to the camera to see what was going and was confused to find that I'd get a few frames of video and then lose connection. I initially blamed this on my phone and the WiFi signal at the office, as when I got home in the evening the camera was working perfectly again.It wasn't until the next day that I was able to observe the camera first-hand running during daylight. When the camera was facing the interior of the house it worked fine, but as soon as it was panned to point out the window it would immediately freeze. I was able to easily repeat this by holding the camera and manually pointing it out the window. Every time the bushes and grass came into shot the camera would freeze displaying a black frame. If the camera was quickly pointed away from the window it would recover and start streaming video, and once pointed back outside it would immediately lock up again.The only way I was able to operate the camera while pointing out of the front-window was to reduce the resolution down from 640x480 to 320x240. Once the resolution was reduced the camera worked perfectly, but the resolution was now so low it was impossible to identify anyone via the footage.When not freezing due to complex scenes the camera and it's PTZ mechanism worked well. When pointed out the window it failed dramatically.This camera didn't work for my intended use, I've now re-purposed it for use monitoring the interior of our home during the day and night. In this role it works perfectly.All-in-all this camera works well if you play to it's strengths.PROs:- Cheap- Wireless- Pan-Tilt-Zoom functionality- Two-way audioCONs:- Completely freezes and reboots when displaying complex scenes- Quite noisy image- MJPEG is a horribly inefficient compression method which uses way more bandwidth than needed.The only reason I gave this three stars instead of less is that when running inside the home it works as expected.", "Date": "February 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Cameras are okay BUT service and support are HORRIBLE", "Author": "Sandy S \"Sandy S\"", "ReviewID": "R3W0SJY078208M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have ordered 8 of these particular cameras and 1 Foscam FI8919W Wireless Outdoor and my feedback/review here is based on my TOTAL experience with a) the cameras b) Amazon, and c) FoscamI'll start out by saying that I bought the Foscam cameras based on the reviews that I found on Amazon; I have not tried any other cameras so I can't really compare against other manufacturers. Based on this, I feel that the cameras are of good quality for the price you can get them for here on Amazon. I have seen the same cameras priced much higher elsewhere, so I'm glad I bought my F18910W's on amazon.com.The cameras come with a disk that installs a couple of different software utilities ... one of which is: Foscam IP Camera - I spent well over 2 hours trying to get this software to work  and finally emailed support - they were absolutely no help at all and told me I should use Blue Iris software (which is a $49.00 program that they sell). The Foscam IP Camera software does not even come with any documentation or help files. After trying to find anything of relevance on the forums and YouTube, etc. ... I gave up and purchased the Blue Iris software (more on that on my Blue Iris review).I did have a hardware problem with one out of the nine cameras and Amazon took care of this immediately upon receiving my email regarding the problem. I LOVE amazon.com ... they never fail to take care of any issues i have with anything.Now let me give you a little advice; don't make the same mistake that I made ... I was using one of the Foscam FI8910W to monitor my front yard/street. Because it was not an outdoor camera i had it inside just pointed out the window. Well, at night the IR (infrared) lights reflect off the window and the view is awful (extremely distorted). So I decided I would order the FI8919W outdoor camera. HERE'S WHERE I MADE MY MISTAKE ... I was given a coupon code that gave me a 10% off discount if i ordered the camera from the foscam.ca site, which I did, and I saved $16.50 off of the $165.00 price. WHAT A MISTAKE that was ... ordering from the Foscam.ca site. I checked the status of the order every day and it kept showing 'Processing' ... after a week I phoned them and was told the camera had already shipped and i should be getting tracking info shortly. Another day went by ... same thing ... phoned them and was told the camera shipped but still no tracking info. Then I emailed them and was told that the camera had not shipped and it was backordered. I told them I was furious at being mislead and to cancel my order. Within a half hour I received confirmation that they 'had just shipped' the order. I told them I needed this camera days ago and to expedite it ... they said 'too late' can't do anything about it now. O.M.GAAAAWD!!!!  What a horrible company.  I only wish I would have ordered this camera directly from amazon.com as I would have received it within two days (I ordered it on Jan 29th and according to the tracking it will not be here until Feb 13th). I am so disgusted with this company that I will never deal with them directly again ... and I wish i could find a comparable product just so I don't have to support their company again in the future.  Their tech support is horrible, their user guides are non-existent, and they intentionally mislead me.So in the end, let me say ... the cameras are okay; amazon.com is awesome as always; foscam.ca is the most unprofessional company I've ever dealt with.

When it comes to IP video, most of the time, it's not the hardware, rather the qos of the network fueling the hardware.For corporate video conferencing, good qos means high end routers, gigabit switch ports, dedicated high bandwidth comm circuits, video/voice traffic isolation, and even data compression.  All of this costing at least 1k per month, depending on the level desired and budget.Now, Since these options aren't typically available for the home, we're limited to what our Internet service providers offer.  Mostly being that of increased Internet bandwidth.  For optimum, it's 'ultra', and for fios, it's 'quantum'.  For me, for just an extra $6 per month, my Internet speed service was essentially doubled, which is a no brainier.  Also look into static ip services, and higher end modems or routers if offered by your ISP.I also keep my IP cam hard wired, which contributes to higher connectivity stability and performance.  When wireless, there are several new things to consider for qos, so be weary of problems specific to the IP cam's wireless connectivity vs. hard wired.For those having issues even getting it up and running, or for those who want to research instalation steps before your IP cam even arives, which is what I did, search for your ip cam model in YouTube.  You will find several videos that walk you through the initial setup for local viewing and separate videos for advanced setup for remote viewing on your wireless devices.Just some general notes:Make sure you have installed the latest firmware before settin up remote access.Heavily password protect your ipcam and router before settin up remote access.Setup the IP cam with a static ip address(i.e. don't let it use DHCP settin.Don't setup the ip cam on port 80, use a different port.Inbound audio works very well., but for baby monitoring, I will depend upon a separate audio specific monitor for when I'm sleeping.Feedback is received if a remote device plays back inbound audio when near the IP cam.

As others have said, it is not a 1-2-3 set up.  But I weighed my options of going for the $199 Dropcam, which I bought my daughter and hers was easy to setup or saving $130 and going for the Foscam.  Since I needed three of them, I figured I would save $390 and besides, I like learning new things with tech so I decided to go for this one.Some differences of Drop Cam and Foscam.1. Drop Cam easy to set up vs. Foscam - let's just say its challenging2. Drop Cam is smaller and does not rotate - Foscam not only rotates around the whole room but when you access the camera from  your iPhone, just by touching the video and swiping your finger you can move the camera remotely.3. Drop Cam is set up from their website.  My daughter just popped the CD in and it took her directly to the website to finish setting up her cameras.  - Foscam runs off a CD.  Now this is where some information would help for those who are trying to set this camera up.Setup -The setup instructions say to plug the camera in power then the router.  Did this but had trouble opening the exe file and having it pick up the camera. Once it finally did pick up the camera it shows you the IP address of your camera. ex: HTTP://192.168.1.25 and then I sat there wondering what to do since the setup instructions shows a picture of an interface popping open.  This did not happen.  Called Foscam and was told my wait was 25 minutes.  While waiting I figured I would try to type this address into a browser.  At first it only worked in I.E but then I got it opened in Firefox.  Once in there you can change the camera name and your password.  Then I was told to change ports so there is no conflicts.  Now I am working on the alerts.  When I go to set up the Alerts and click on the choice to have motion detection and press submit , I come up with \"400 Bad Request Can't parse request\"  I am still working on this problem and will update this review when I figure out what that problem is.Now let's look at the software.  You will have to update the firmware first then the software second.  I am using an iPhone 4 and an iPad 2 for the software.  I downloaded both the free programs they have and both of them work fine on the iPhone but not so consistent on the iPad. I have iOS 6.1.3 on both.  Not sure if it's because I have little room left on the iPad and more on the iPhone but there is more inconsistency on the iPad. I will be upgrading to iOS 7 with more storage so I will update this review.------------------------------Update 1/29/14Called Foscam for support twice.  Both times the service was very professional and polite.  The first one, definitely from India was very hard to understand but he had the patience to stay with me an hour on the phone.  I allowed him to take control of my computer and he also could not get my camera to set the alarms.  He asked if he could do it from his computer and I gave him permission.  He was able to set the alarm from his computer so he said it was definitely something on my computer.  So then I had to get the other cameras programmed to send me email alerts and after disabling all my antivirus software and K-9 patrol, it still didn't work.  Then found out that in order to set the alarms, you have to click on the \"Schedule\" and then click on \"set All\" then it worked.  So I am not sure if it was a combination of things or if just this one thing made the difference.I had updated my firmware and software but this support person said they just release another update a couple days ago.  This seemed to make a difference.  I was able to use the ipCamera.exe file then click on the camera's IP address and the browser did open.I noticed that other posters stated that the support person makes you sign onto Amazon to rate them.  Well, this is how they work.  After you get done with the problem the support person must be instructed to ask where you bought the camera.  If you say Amazon and they are still in control of your PC, they literally try to sign onto Amazon for you and lead you through the process. I notice he went directly to my browser and typed in Amazon then attempted to go to the review site.  Since I do not have Amazon sign on automatically he asked me to sign on.  I politely and firmly told him that I would do it when I had time.  So saying all that, and without any pressure from any support person, I would still give this camera a 4-star rating for both the camera and the support they gave me.The second camera couldn't be seen on my network so I called Foscam support and it took him about 5 minutes to figure out what was wrong.  Wait time was not as long as I had feared.  Embarrassingly, I typed in the wrong password to my router.  Of course, I thought it was right but I must have left something out.  This is just a note in case someone else doesn't see their camera on the network and they think that the password is correct.The third camera wouldn't even start.  Again the support person took control of my PC and attempted to get the camera going by restarting and resetting it.  Nothing happened.  He immediately said to return the camera and they would replace it.  So I am working on that now. BTW, this one asked to rate them on Amazon and I told him I would do it later and he just let it go.  Never tried to sign onto Amazon for me.Foscam gives clear pics in the dark and clear pictures in the light.  I love being able to remotely move the camera around from my phone and I would recommend this camera.  I think that Foscam must have read the reviews and are making great strides in trying to upgrade consumers experiences._________________Update 1/30/14One camera was defective.  I had a choice to return it direct to Foscam but I would have to pay the shipping since I did not purchase it from their site or return it to Amazon.  I am returning it and asking for a replacement because I am very pleased with the other two camera's.Just a note on the software:  I found the free Foscam software to work just fine with my camera's.  There was a suggestion to try the Foscam Blue Iris Pro.  If you want to try that software you can download a trial version off CNet.

I intend to get a few more, and I just did recommend this camera to a friend.The biggest issue for me is that I do not want to be tied to a manufacturer's website. Let me explain: most IP cameras require you to log in to the manufacturers website, give them a ton of personal info, and *they* relay the camera images to you. For the sake of emphasis, this means you trust the manufacturer to relay personal video images out of your network through their web site. You are implicitly trusting them with live video feeds of your family and property, and worse- access to a device inside your network. That represents an enormous amount of trust that in my opinion has not been earned.  I figure a company with thousands of people's video feeds is a juicy target for hackers, while as an individual I am not.  Of course the reason these company-website relays exist is that it's easy for a layperson to implement.  You need to manually set up the Foscam and you have to know how to set up port forwarding in your own router.  If that's not for you, read no further.The Foscam cameras have an install CD, which I did not use; instead, I followed another reviewer's advice and set up the camera manually.  It took me less than 10 minutes.1. Plug the camera into an ethernet jack on your router and let it get an IP via DHCP2. Log into the router, get the camera's IP address from \"attached devices\"3. Use that IP to log into the camera using a browser (user: admin  pass: *blank* )4. Give the camera a static IP, set up a non-standard port  (camera reboots when you apply this)5. Set up WiFi  (camera reboots when you apply this)6. Go back into your router and set up port forwarding (which means your wan IP:port-number forwards to your camera)7. TaDaaa! it just works with any browser.  If you're slick you can use the following syntax to bookmark your camera: http://user:pass@IPaddress:PortNumber and not even have to deal with logging in each time (Microsoft disabled that syntax on IE... so use any other, more functional browser)8. As a basic security approach, I recommend you remove the default username (admin) entirely, and set up new users and passwords - this dramatically reduce your susceptibility to brute force attacks.The features are great: remote pan and tilt, IR light on and off, you can configure the camera to send emails to multiple addresses when it picks up movement and/or sound (sensitivity adjustable) and it can also send images via FTP.A very highly ranked review (that I voted helpful) expressed concern over a known hardware flaw with all Foscam cameras, but I have not encountered any problems with the 3 cameras I bought.  There's a decent iPhone app, which is perhaps a bit too simple but it's functional.  Lastly, if you're thinking of setting up the camera in a window so you can watch the front of your home (as I did), I recommend you consider the black camera instead of the white one, because I often see the reflection of the white camera in the window that I'm trying to see through. I don't know that the black one would be any better, I just know that I get a significant reflection with the white cameras :)Technically speaking, I'm a bit disappointed with the max 640x480 resolution, but to be honest, for the price, you can't beat it, and the image is very decent.  I'm also impressed with the auto-aperture range of these cameras.

I found the written instructions (read them after I had everything working) were very clear and would be useful to someone without much technical skill.I set my camera up for remote monitoring.  To do so you do need to be ready to log into your home router and make some configuration additions (1) create static IP's and (2) assign port numbers to those IP's.  Remote monitoring works surprisingly well.  I hard wired one camera directly to my router, its too far from the wireless router to get a consisten signal.  The second camera I connected wirelessly.  There are no performance differences.  If you have a good enough wireless signal, that's the way to go.The camera image is clear and the colors seem reasonably accurate.  One camera is mounted inside monitoring the inside, the other under a large eave monitoring the outside.  The eave is big enough that the camera won't get wet.  So far its working fine even though its and inside camera.I did experience the famous buffer overflow / endless reboot problem.  My outside camera is aimed at trees with high detail.  Its the high detail that blows up the camera.  I contacted Foxcam and they now have a software fix.

I am a new person to installing a security cam and this was nothing like the other one I installed a couple of months ago.  YOU MUST follow the steps exactly to get this camera to work wirelessly.  If you have the installation CD download it and follow the directions.  Their is an IP camera finder that after you have your camera plugged into your wireless router and powered on it will tell you the local ip address that was assigned on your wireless router.  Be sure you know how to access your web interface for your router before starting anything so you can verify and see what is going on thru the whole process.  All the router to assign the IP address for the router then type that address into your web browser and see the camera's web interface.  Mine was 192.168.1.112 initially.  Make sure you can see the camera software at that address.  Then  make sure you know your wireless network user id and password.  While in the camera software go to the wireless setup and check the box that says \"to use wirelessly\" then \"scan\" to find your wireless internet id highlight it and put in your password.  I also had to click on the box that said tkp and AES to make sure the camera would work with my router.  Once you do that the camera will reboot, it will move up to the right then to the left then back to center, there is a window on the web interface that counts down from 30 (seconds). AFTER the camera stops moving count to 10 and disconnect the Ethernet cable from the back of the camera and then WAIT for up to a minute. Before the camera reboots again you get a message  box on the web browser about installing something from Szchen China.  Say ok and then the camera will reboot when it is done cycling from up to right to left you should see the green light on the back of the camera flashes rapidly.  You also will notice the ip address on your router is now a different number and that the MAC id has also changed.  Check and see if you have video and if you do Yay you saved 3 hours of tedious repetitive booting and rebooting.  Now if after you enter your wireless information as I indicated above and waited for the camera to reboot then count to 10 seconds then remove the Ethernet cable I can't remember if took the power plug out of the back of the camera or not to get the camera to boot up again and finalize being wireless.  The best advise is go online to Foscam and print out the support info they have.  The basics are get video with the Ethernet cable still connected, then get the wireless configured then if you have a DNS service you can configure a static IP on the wireless router, then come back to the camera's web ip browser and configure the same static DHCP address as on your wireless router.  Make sure you also  do the port forwarding on the wireless router and the camera's ip software. I found it was a lot of trial and error hence it took me so long.  I made sure I backed up the camera's settings so I hopefully I will never have to do from scratch again.  I LOVE the features of the camera.  You can shut off the IR so you can point the camera out of a window and have a porch light on and still see what's going on by a door.  If you use the IR behind a window you end up with a bright white globe and really can not seeing anything.  Also this does have audio that you can also turn off.  Also setting up user accounts for people to access the webcam from the www is easy and you can limit their access to changing device settings by putting them on visitor status.

The DNS host service, recommended by the Foscam installation, requires a $25 dollar annual fee. While there are other alternatives out there, I find it a bit disingenuous to say there are no hidden fees when the user guide directs you to a service that is not free.Also, be aware that the setup for this camera is not for the average person. The setup is significantly more complex than installing a modem, printer/scanner or an external hard drive. Foscam does provide a DVD that walks you through the process step by step. But configurations they walk you through are generic and are not likely to match your home network in many cases.

Since no one ended up purchasing it for us, we logged on to Amazon to buy it ourselves. As luck would have it, the camera was out of stock. Since our baby was due within weeks we did not have time to waste and decided to buy it directly from the manufacturer. BIG MISTAKE!My husband tried everything he could to get this camera to work, but we kept getting a blinking red light. We even waited in the long lines at Comcast to exchange our old router for a new router/modem combo in the hopes that was the issue. Granted neither my husband nor I are software developers, but we didn't think we needed to be just to get this camera to work. Needless to say we called the technical support number several times to try and troubleshoot. After we were dumped into voice mail, my husband resorted to e-mail.We first received a response from a support team member named Raheel who told us that \"a blinking red light usually means the camera is not receiving proper power and either there is a hardware issue on the camera's main board or a power supply failure, however from personal experience I do believe you will need an RMA replacement for the camera unfortunately. If you have a green LED light on the power supply is it solid in color when you plug it in or does it also blink?\" My husband replied that there was no green light - just the blinking red light, and no lights on the LAN cable.We then received another reply from another support team member named Edward who asked \"Is the green led solid in color or does it blink?\" My husband again told this gentleman we did not have a green light at all, just a blinking red light.That is where all replies from this company ended. Clearly it was obvious to Foscam that their product was broken and needed to be returned, yet no one made any attempt to resolve the issue. Our daughter arrived a week later. Having not heard back from anyone and not having the money to shell out for a new video camera, we ended up with a cheap radio monitor.I wish I had seen the reviews of the problems everyone else had had with this camera before we bought this. Now we are stuck with $100 camera we can't use. The camera is still under warranty, but the manufacturer is in China and there is no information on how to fix or return the camera. I am assuming the cost to ship it to China and back is more than the camera itself. It's so frustrating!!! Do yourself a favor and make sure to buy this from Amazon if you buy it at all.

I have the sensitivity set to the weakest setting, which curbs the false reads.Anyway, it has worked great for about 2 months after which the camera appears to have developed a reset glitch. Every 3-4 days, the camera will pan from the saved position toward the ceiling of my garage... well, that's no good.I've checked for new firmware in a hopes Foscam might have addressed this issue. No Dice. I'm on their latest, so there is nothing I can do there.Instead I have to going into the web based settings and pan the camera back to the desired position. I save the position, but it never saves.... again, a firmware issue.So, while it works, this is not a \"set it ad forget it\" device.

I now have two cameras (one black and one white) that I purchased when they were on sale for 69 dollars.The setup is easy if you are viewing the cameras on your home internet but a little more difficult if you want to be able to view them away from home (ie a smart phone, Ipad or another computer).I will not get into the setup as I think it is explained on these different reviews.  However, if you have problems, there are various YouTube videos that will guide you in the right direction.  Having said that, it is intimidating to get it to work right, but once you do, it is quite rewarding.  The problem is really just dealing with stuff that you do not do on a daily basis; such as port forwarding, setting up a free IP provider, etc.  I spent some time before I finally was able to get it right.  The setup video that comes with the camera helps but there are some better YouTube videos out there.To test to see if you have it right, you should download some free apps and then use your 3g or 4g on your smart phone or Ipad, etc. to see if it works, otherwise you will just be seeing the camera on your home network on those devices.What is amazing to me is that you get a nice clear color picture from this camera; you are able to rotate it remotely; take pictures; record video and set up an alarm to take pictures at various times if the camera recognizes a visitor or intruder. It also has sound and I can talk to someone and hear them with audio enabled. Really unbelievable features for a reasonably priced camera.You can set up the alarm for the camera to work at certain times of the day right from the included software.  Many times I leave for work in the morning and when I arrive at my office, I have about five pictures that arrive by email showing my vehicle leaving the house.  If someone comes to the house and I am at the office, I will receive an emails showing pictures of them arriving.  The camera also has an option to snoop for sound which triggers the alarm.  If you have your computer on, it will beep if you so choose.My camera works out of my window and so it limits my ability to see at night with infrared. However, I also have one in the basement and the camera automatically adjust to the dark and I can see everything in total darkness.I am hoping to set up an outdoor camera in the future, but right now I am extremely please with the price, features and quality of these cameras.

I followed Tickle's step-by-step instruction and the installation was a breeze.In order to do the remote monitoring outside your house, you have to configure your router to allow you to get into your home network. The port forwarding setting is a task which varies from router to router. You will have to be a little network savvy in order to get this setting up. For example, I have a TrendNet router. The manual did not explain how to perform the port forwarding. I searched on internet and found an instruction which did not make 100% sense. I had to make a small guess and made it work.The best feature of this product is that, once the feature is turned on, it will email you your IP address if your network provider changes your IP address. During my recent trip to Asia, my IP address was changed 4 times. I could access my home network with new IP address. If there would be a hacker to my home network, he/she could not get in after IP address is changed. This makes me feel much better to open up my home network a bit. Still, as soon as I got home, I deactivate the port forwarding setting in my router just to be safe.The motion detection works well when I set the sensitivity to 5. I have a lamp which is turned on and off by a timer. The motion detection detected the light change and emailed me a series of photos. This is a good assurance feature. I get to see the photo twice a day even there was non event to let me know the Foscam is working hard to watch my house for me. When I got home after the trip, I triggered the motion detection. I was pleasantly informed via my email that my home was invaded with my pictures in there.The resolution of the camera is not very high. However, I had to set the resolution even lower in order to view it via my DSL which has limited upload speed. So, practically, I am limited by my internet connection. This makes me think about switching to other internet provider.I highly recommend this camera.

Every review I have read about this app says this is not the case. I would love to review that program, but if it does not work for the dozens of persons who did buy it, I am not going to spend $7 to buy it. I can review the audio function when using this camera right out of the box however; audio is NON-EXISTENT. When you click on \"audio\" the video cuts out and says I need to install VLC player as a plugin to use the audio function. The problem? I already exclusively use VLC as my default player. In other words, the audio DOES NOT WORK on a Mac unless you use a crash-happy browser like IE. **When I used PC my IE would crash daily. Maybe they fixed that since 2011.**The camera Pros:Love it. It is small but provides excellent bright day, cloudy day, and absolute blacked out night video. At night, the inside of my house is so dark, thanks to my blacked out window treatments, that my Rotty bumps into things. This camera sees it all!  Also, when the camera pans and tilts there is ZERO sound. I even stuck my ear next to the camera while on the \"patrol\" setting and could not hear the motor working. Excellent for covert and clandestine surveillance. The patrol setting is a function where the camera will automatically pan (or tilt) from one directional stop all the way to the other in both axis'.Cons:No Audio. Not only cannot I not use the audio IN function (to my MBP), I cannot use the audio out either (to the camera from my MBP). So, as a baby monitor, this is useless unless all you want is a camera. I know that some will retort and say \"Just use IE and the audio will work\" - NO. This camera is advertised as working with Mozilla, Safari, Mac, IPod, Ipad, and Iphone. There is nothing on the Foscam site (except for angry customer reviews) that even hint that the audio is only supported if you use a Microsoft product. So in other words, this fails to meet even a slight aspect of the mark advertised - hence the 3-stars.I originally bought FI8905W cameras that crashed every few minutes following the first day of use then they stopped working all together - they got returned quickly. As this is only the 2nd day of use for this camera - only time will tell if this is better than the FI8905W's. I really hope so!***UPDATE***A tech support individual named \"Zohaib\" from Foscam emailed me today (only 2 days after submitting a support request - that was really fast) about not being able to get the audio to work while running Mozilla on a 10.8 Mac. His solution had NOTHING to do with Mozilla Firefox OR Mac. Their \"help\" only contained instructions on how to get it to work on Microsoft IE on Win 7 & 8. I do not think they even read the support email requests - they just respond by copying and pasting a random response probably from a grab bag of sorts. Maybe they throw darts at a board containing multiple solutions. Not happy Bob, not Happy.I would return it because it is being sold under a completely false pretense of working with a Mac; however, the camera works great as a camera and it is the cheapest one I have been able to find. So, I will have to resign myself as voting 'for' their product in the current configuration and with the gross negligence in their marketing department by letting them keep my money - to my dismay.

I am a mac user and do not have a disc drive on my computer so I had to use the videos posted on Foscam's support website. The first three videos were very easy to follow and provided clear step by step instructions. The last video on port forwarding did not apply to the equipment I was using so I had to use their online written directions. Unfortunately, even following the steps I was unable to get the port forwarding to run correctly and I had to call in to the customer service department for support. The hold time was excessive (over 30min) but after I finally got a representative on the phone, he was able to very quickly (less than 10 min) remote into my computer and get things up and running. He even provided me with assistance in getting the email alerts and my iphone app up and running.Overall I am very satisfied with the camera and its features. The video quality, even with the night vision, is great. The two way audio also works well. I have not had any issues with the sound quality as others have mentioned. It is plenty loud without the use of an added microphone.I am using the iphone/ipad app called Foscam Pro. It did cost 5.99 but is worth the price. There is a slight delay in the audio and video but still acceptable compared to other cameras I have used in the past. While watching video the app will stay open for continuous monitoring.

Even though I my job entails me operating a CCTV system of almost 500 cameras, I have actually never set one up. So I bought this camera well before the baby was due so I could play with it and see how to set it up and operate it.For the most part, it is exactly what I wanted. The picture is clear, but obviously not HD quality (I could not justify spending an extra $100 for the FI9821W which does 720P, when the video monitor end of this set-up is a non-retina screen iPod touch or our android phones). However it is very usable for our intended use.For night viewing, you will need to use the IR lighting on the camera, which does put the camera in \"Black & white\" mode. Any camera that uses IR for night time viewing will do this.The instructions that come with the camera (10 page, 3\u201d X 5\u201d booklet) are about as worthless as possible. Instead of calling Foscam, I used the instructions on this website: [...] so that made things MUCH easier.I also am not using the \u201cBlue Iris\u201d program to access the camera. Once you figure out the IP address of the camera you access the camera through a web browser, there is an on screen interface you can use.  It is about a 1 second delay from moving the camera (via web interface) to the camera actually moving. I know the camera works with Chrome and IE.  With Chrome you can basically move the camera, and that is about it. With IE, you can configure the camera just about any way you want, including setting up various log-in\u2019s and what access they have to the camera. The access levels are \u201cAdmin\u201d, which gives that person complete control over everything the camera is capable of. \u201cSecond level is \u201cUser,\u201d which allows someone to control the camera (but not change settings). The last is \u201cGuest,\u201d which only allows someone to see the video feed. Each user has their own sign-in and password that someone with \u201cAdmin\u201d privileges can set.The bad thing is the camera has \u201creset\u201d it self about once every 3 weeks. When this happens, the camera goes back to the factory default home position and sets the IR filter to \u201cauto\u201d (IR comes on when the light levels are low). It has not wiped any of the preset positions I set, or any of the users.On the home WiFi, we are getting about 45 Frames per second day time, and 60 at night with the IR. If we access the camera with our cell phones (using LTE cell data, not wifi) we get 20 FPS day time and 25 FPS at night.Overall I am happy with the camera, and would suggest it as a baby monitor.I did knock a star off for the random resets, and the lack of abilities you have with Crome", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Foscam falls short", "Author": "A.

were tearing up the soil. Our yard is flat but then drops off into a small canyon where we know there are mountain lions, and deer regularly come into the yard during the day. But some other creature is making a mess of the lawn (besides the gophers that is). I used my DSLR camera but had to leave the light on in the yard for that to take photos. I took 900 photos over three nights, one per minute, but caught nothing. I thought about getting an IR camera but expected them to be well into the multiple hundred dollars. This one surprised me.I received the Foscam F18910W today, took it out of the box, connected it to the router and it came right up working. The documentation gives quite a few steps to get it working but much of it was automatic on my computer. It didn't take more than a couple of minutes to get the WiFi working too. It also showed up on my iPod Touch browser easily as soon as I entered the IP address of the camera. My setup time from box to working on the WiFi was less than 10 minutes but then I'm tech savvy.Tonight I set the camera up on a small tripod under the covered patio and aimed it at the area I wanted to watch all night. I'm quite pleased that the IR lights up the area quite well. I can easily see 30 feet of the back yard clearly.For a camera with built in WiFi, that can be tilted and panned from the computer, that lights up the yard at night on the video, I'm quite pleased.Of course it would be nice to have HD video but the 0.3MP image is quite enough for us to see what animals come into the yard.The only problem I had was when I tried to record the video on my desktop computer the recorded files were not in the designated folder. It took me a couple of hours to get it working with the help of some Google searches. The problem was solved by running the 32 bit version of IE on my 64 bit system. Strange and a bit of a pain but at least it works.I have it configured to alarm when something moves in the yard, and to send me email with photos when it does. Fortunately there is no wind tonight so it won't be sending me photos all night long.The feature I wish it had would be if I could limit the horizontal scan. That is: there is a button to have the camera do a Horizontal Patrol but it swings from end to end, an arc of something like 270 degrees. I would like to limit both ends so it only swings about 150 degrees. But I can't find any controls for that desirable feature.I expect soon we'll know what animal is tearing up our yard.8/30/13 We discovered it has been a raccoon tearing up our grass. I'll add a short video.I'm very pleased with the operation of the camera. It has not dropped the WiFi connection after 3 days. It also automatically switches from IR to non-IR as the sun comes up and visa-versa at night.UPDATE 9/11/2013This camera did exactly what we needed it to do. We were able to watch video of 4 skunks and a raccoon being caught in the traps placed by a professional trapper over a five night period. However I did find some bugs.1) The alarm feature has a time setting to disable alarms during the periods selected. It never worked for me. I would get alarms no matter how I set up that time control. The alarms would send me email, with photos, day or night even though I tried to disable daytime alarms. I got so many alarms that I had to disable them.2) Alarms would be triggered by the wind blowing the trees and bushes which is understood. But even on a calm night with the alarm sensitivity set to 7 or 8 it completely missed the large raccoon 8 to 10' from the camera.3) I think there is supposed to be a feature to capture video when an alarm goes off. I was capturing video 24/7 so that may override the alarm video feature. But in any case it never recorded a video on an alarm.4) I set the date and time in the camera but all video files, showing the date and time within the video frame, were totally wrong in date and time. Not even this decade.Otherwise it did the trick. If I had it to do over again I'd buy the HD version so I could see more detail.", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "very pleased", "Author": "damageless", "ReviewID": "R3LGI6I2QXNVEY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm very pleased with this product.

It is very easy to install and to accomplish such a task.  The Foscam website has good instruction videos.However, if you want to access the camera from the internet when you are away from home, it will be difficult to nearly impossible to accomplish.  Direct streaming via HTTP for remote access requires \u201cport forwarding.\u201d  After spending a week trying, I gave up.  I do not believe it is the fault of Foscam, I think this problem exists with all IP cameras requiring port forwarding for direct streaming. I highly suspect that my ISP (Comcast) has control of all my ports.  I called Comcast many times; they have mysteriously hanged up my phone during several of these sessions, exactly when I asked them about the ports.I called Foscam three times; their technicians were courteous and willing to help.  From their end\u2019s examination, my port forwarding setting is set up correctly.  They tried and I also tried, using my phone\u2019s mobile network, to remotely access my camera \u2013 but without success.Regarding the software \u2013 the ip camera tool is very difficult to set up for recording on your hard drive.  It appears to be recording using avi file format, but if you go to the path where you saved the file, nothing existed.  I am using IE8, and the live video only can be viewed on 32-bit, not with a 64-bit IE8 browser.  Google\u2019s Chrome also works, and actually it is easier to take a snap shot from there.Another issue I discovered, regarding the ip camera tool, is that I was unable to successfully add another Foscam on the multi-device setting, so I can view both my cameras on the same page.The only internet access that I managed to make work is using the FTP setting on the camera.  The host website I use is Mangocam.  However, with this method you cannot control the camera, so there is no pan and tilt.  Also, the frame rate is poor.  The free subscription on Mangocam is one camera with 1fps.  You can also schedule video recordings with the free subscription, which works pretty good. Higher frame rates are available with paid subscriptions.I would like to know which ISPs will allow the customers to control some of the ports for personal IP camera monitoring purposes.  It seems that security cameras now the day are everywhere. I assumed it would be a breeze to connect an IP camera to my existing ISP broadband connection.

I've configured two widgets (per camera) on our phones: One widget that uses the local WiFi in the house, and another widget for remote access over our phone's data plan. So if we are at home and want to check that the little one is still asleep, we use the WiFi configuration (which uses a local IP address.) For remote access when away from home, we have our own domain name and dynamic DNS service. However, this is not required - Foscam includes their own dynamic DNS service for free, so you can reach your camera remotely over the internet without using an IP address (which may change, depending on your ISP.)

I wanted something that I could view remotely from my desktop at work and my iPhone4.  I had done quite a bit of searching around for a solid IP camera before I settled on this.  I had looked at d-link, tenvis, wanscam, and others.  However, none of those had the number of views that Foscam had or the number of helpful setup tips.  Soo after long deliberation I decided this was reasonable to get even after I had some concerns related to reviews and security.  To break it down further -What I like:+Price+Size of the camera (It is not an extremely large camera by any means.  Good to keep \"hidden\" in a tight location)+IR cut (Adds a more realistic color.  Not washed out.  Take a look at AwkwardHamster's youtube video comparing other foscam models)+Accessing the camera remotely (It's good once you get pass the setup portion, which I explain in my comments)+Picture quality - Good (Don't expect it to be the sharpest quality.  You are not going to see a hair on the ground 5 feet away.  If you are expecting long distance use with this camera don't expect amazing quality images)+Wide variety of settingsWhat I didn't like:-Power cord (~3ft, who does that?)-Reviews, a bit off topic but I want to make a comment about all of them.  Now I didn't like that so many reviews on Amazon start off by saying \"I couldn't get my camera to connect so I contacted 'insert name here' from Foscam.  They connected the cameras in no time and were extremely helpful'.  At the time of this review 703 similar statements.  Now I find this somewhat fishy that 703 comments are similar.  It seems to me that it is a modified template for comments.  I can't say whether these statements are true or not but just keep it in mind that some if not all may be false comments.  Just my 2 cents.-Minimal information on remote DNS providers.  DNS provider - used to access camera outside of your home network.-Security encryption.  From what I have read in other comments this camera has no security when you try and remotely access this camera.  If you attempt to access it remotely your username/password is sent in \"Plain Text\".  This means if you use public wifi your password can be \"sniffed\" out.  Now this might of concern to some and others it's no big deal.  So I suggest for some to do more research on how to access your camera securely.  I personally plan on setting up the camera for viewing through a VPN (virtual private network).  I haven't done it yet but the goal is to purchase a router that has VPN capability and install tomato or dd-wrt.Stuck between like/don't like:>Camera setup.  This is a tough one.  Many people say turn away from this camera unless you have a degree in computer science because it is almost impossible to setup.  This is not necessarily true if you find the right steps online.  I didn't follow the owners manual for the setup or use the CD the camera came with.  I followed one reviewers steps and I got the camera up and running in no time.Camera Setup:I followed \"R. Tickle's\" instructions from March 29, 2012 to set the camera up.  Here is what he used with slight modifications and explanations that may make it easier for some.1) Do NOT install the software on the CD.  The CD is used to try and find the camera.  On my first attempt to access my camera I did toss the CD in and install the software, but unfortunately I was left with a blank text box with no camera IP.  The manual said I should reinstall the software so I did.  That didn't work so I decided to find it using my router web login explained below.2) Connect the camera by Cat-5 wire to your router.  My camera came with a coiled up cat-5 cable.  You shouldn't have to go searching for one.3) Login to your router (via browser, for linksys it is 192.168.1.1) and find the IP address assigned to your camera.  This should be fairly easy to do especially if you have the Linksys smart router.  Navigate to your connected devices and copy the cameras IP address.4) Login to the camera at that IP address (via browser) and IMMEDIATELY turn OFF the DHCP.  Copy and Paste the IP address for the camera into a new blank tab and hit enter.  This should take you to the foscam page that shows activex, server push mode, and mobile phone.  If you use IE select activex, firefox/chrome use server push mode.  Selecting one of those will give you a pop-up for username/password.  The default username/password is : Username-admin, there is no password.  Once you get in you can navigate to \"Basic Network Settings\"  and uncheck DHCP.5) Give your camera a fixed IP address on your network and fill in the subnet mask with what you normally use.  This step is pretty simple.  You can assign your camera an IP address.  I used the IP it was initially assigned except I changed the last three numbers xxx.xxx.x.151.  Next you want to fill in the subnet mask, which can be found in your router settings or I believe it mostly is 255.255.255.0 (per google search of course).  Enter in your gateway IP and DNS server IP (you will use the same IP address for both of these.  you can find this IP address from your router login page in maybe a \"local networks\" tab it should be the IP address of your router).  The last thing you can fill in is the HTTP port.  Select a four digit number such as \"5252\".  Remember this because it will be used to setup port forwarding.  Now hit SUBMIT and wait for the camera to reboot.  Now that you have your IP address for your camera nailed down you may wish to go into your router and assign the IP camera a static IP address.  This ensures another device will not accidentally take your foscam IP address.6) Fill in the SSID, encryption type, and share key used by your wireless network.  Hit SUBMIT, this will reboot the camera.  Now you you can unplug the camera from your router.  ***NOTE*** I have found that once you enable wireless on the camera it may take some time to actually connect to your wifi network.  So if you reboot your camera be patient (more than 1 minute patient).  Watch the camera for the green LED to have a steady and consistent blink.  Any hesitation in blinking means it has not connected yet.7) Re-login to the camera at the new fixed IP address to verify that everything's working and your settings have stayed.8) Login to your router and set a port-forwarding entry to map to the fixed IP address and HTTP port you gave your camera.  You will also have to enter in the device IP address, the one you just gave the camera.9) Now in order to access the camera remotely you will need a DDNS service.  Foscam now recommends \"no-ip\" for free DNS instead of dydns.  Do a google search for it.  Create an account.  Foscam has their own service free for 3 years but after that you will have to pony up some money.  No-ip is free but and has one downfall, every 30 days you will need to say you will keep the DNS assigned to you.  I haven't had the service for more than 30 days, but from what I have found online you receive an email and have to navigate to a link that is in the email.  I guess this is the price you pay for a free service.10) Go back to your camera settings.  Select DDNS Service Settings then Select third party DDNS drop down and find no-ip.  Enter your username and password.  This is the information you used on the no-ip site to create an account.  Finally you will want to enter in the ddns host.  This is what you set up to be your camera website/host.  Example:  mycamera01(dot)no-ip(dot)biz.  Sorry about the dots, trying to avoid having information blocked.  Now click SUBMIT and wait for the camera to reboot.11) Now try and access your camera using your new host.  You can try this from 3G/4G to make sure you can connect outside your home network.  Open browser tab and enter in all the host information.  Using my example: mycamera01(dot)no-ip(dot)biz:5252.  If you notice I entered  :5252  after the host name.  This is because we changed it earlier in step 5.12) You now should be able to connect remotely.  Since the hard part is done go and change your username and password to the camera if you haven't done that yet.I hope these steps help lower the frustration of setting up this camera.My final comment!!IP Camera APPS. I mentioned earlier that I had an iPhone and wanted to access the cameras for remote viewing.  After much searching I decided to download \"LiveCams Pro\" right now $3.99 in the appstore.  I selected it after seeing others recommend it and seeing all the cameras they support.  I may or may not want a different camera manufacturer such as d-link and the app supports them.  However, this is not the only app available, Foscam has an app (not free) that you can download.  From what I have found it works well but other than that I haven't had experience with it.I will update with my opinion of the camera as time goes on.

If you receive a defective unit, YOU get to pay to ship it to Foscam and wait 3-4 weeks (according to their web site) for them to ship you a replacement.Now let's talk about the rest...As a stand-alone IP camera, this seems to be a pretty good item. Many reviewers have mentioned that the setup is a bit technical. I happen to have a background in network engineering, so for me, no big deal, but I can very clearly see how other reviewers would have trouble setting this thing up. It takes a bit of work, even for someone like me, and even after configuring multiple of these cameras on my simple home network.If you will be using the cameras on a secured WiFi network, don't expect a high frame rate. The encryption necessary appears to really slow the camera down, so not only does the frame rate drop precipitously, but the camera's response to PTZ commands gets pretty sluggish. I get around 3-4 FPS in WPA2/Personal with AES encryption.Once you get everything set up, it works OK. Other reviewers have pointed out that some features work only in Internet Explorer (on Windows), not Firefox or Chrome. The camera works fine for me in server push mode on Chrome and Firefox, and the user interface is indeed reduced, but only trivially so (minor features like an On-Screen Display can't be enabled).The camera settings are fairly straightforward, but I did discover early what others have also noted: use a fixed IP address. The camera's DHCP capability is a bit hit-and-miss, especially on WiFi. Also be aware that there is no password for the default admin login, so you MUST fix this in the settings, because combined with another default setting, it may leave your camera as a potential security hole in your network--the default dynamic DNS setting is ON, and automatically sets up a simple name in the myfoscam.org domain, so your camera is easily discovered and accessed. Go through each setting, and turn off any features you don't need, including uPNP and Dynamic DNS, unless you understand what they are, why you need to enable them, and how to secure them if enabled. And set a password on admin!A few other reviewers commented that in order to see the camera outside of their own network, they need to sign up for some kind of service, for which there are often fees. That's generally true of any network camera, not a Foscam-specific issue.The defective camera is an interesting beast. It works for a while, but two other nearby cameras (same model, all configured for WiFi) go offline whenever it's powered up--it takes the WiFi network out.  A third camera some distance away has no problem. A little RF analysis shows that the camera is splattering badly--lots of noise all over the band whenever the transmitter is on. Clearly it's got some ills internally, as it also reboots randomly. Again, it's like this out of the box, and I get to pay to ship it to Foscam for a replacement and wait three or so weeks to see if its replacement does any better.All in all, if you get a working unit, and you are able to set it up properly, it will do what you want.

The night vision and pan and tilt features alone would make it a huge leap up from the last time I shopped around for wireless cameras, about 5 years ago.The one serious drawback that drops this down from 5 stars to 3 for me, and might make it useless for other use cases, is that the connection drops out frequently and the power then needs to be reset for it to be usable again within a practical time frame.  Dropping the connection in and of itself may or may not be the camera's fault.  I do have it set up at the opposite end of the house from my router and a few other devices drop off my wireless network sometimes too.  However, of those other devices which do lose their connection, they seem to detect this quickly and automatically reconnect within a few minutes.  The Foscam camera will stay disconnected for hours.  The camera definitely drops its connection much more frequently than any of my other devices (and many of my devices don't drop it at all), and it should really try to reconnect on its own much more quickly.Resetting the power does cause the camera to reconnect to the network, so it is still of use to me since I am using it as a baby monitor and am therefore home and able to reset it when needed.  I imagine this wouldn't work so well if you wanted to use it as a security camera when away from home.

I wonder if a lag in the video feed might cause the server on the camera to get backed up to the point where something dies.  The snapshot is available at the URL \"/snapshot.cgi\" on your camera's website.Third, in conjunction with using an image snapshot instead of the video feed, I have also installed and use the \"Tab Auto Reload\" Firefox add-on.

We wanted to be able to check in on our puppy while we are at work (nerds, I know!).  This camera is under $100 and has so many features! I get a clear feed on my laptop, iPad and iPhone!  I can control the direction the camera point remotely. It has \"night vision\" which is cool (if not creepy). It is wireless so we can hook it up anywhere somewhat near an electrical outlet. The only two improvements that may be available in other models would be a zoom lens and full HD quality. But I do not need those features myself.TWO IMPORTANT NOTES:1) Setting up this camera for remote access on the internet can be DIFFICULT. It requires you to do advanced setting on your home router that you probably are not comfortable with. I would recommend doing a Google search for Foscam + your router's brand/make. You will find specific instructions out there (maybe even in a video format) that will show you exactly what settings you need to change. If your ISP assigns you a dynamic IP, you will also need to sign up for a service like No-IP.com provides. So, again, that's more \"pain in the butt\" setup for you. Once you get past the setup, the thing works GREAT!2) If you are using an iPad/iPhone to view the video feed, download the app \"FoscamPro\".  It cost maybe $5 but it is SO much better than trying to watch via Safari. That $5 price does get you the app on both your iPad and iPhone if you have both.Overall, I really like what I am getting from this camera and would definitely buy another if we need it.", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Laurence L Ostrow", "ReviewID": "R3S50C63J0F2K4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have to say after doing a lot of research on wireless IP cameras, I finally chose this one and am quite pleased with it and all of the features.  This is my first IP camera and bought it mainly to watch the interior of my home while I'm away.  Setting it up was a bit tricky.  The included CD disc is a bit worthless as it does not install anything on your computer, you must find the file you want then load it.  I have found that you really don't need the disc to setup your camera.  What you do need is a good understanding of your routers menus and interface and port forwarding.  To use this as a wireless camera and to remotely access it via the internet or a smartphone or tablet app, you need to set up the IP address of the camera and the router followed by the port assigned to the camera, which is done manually via your routers setup.  After many hours of tinkering, I finally got everything working with the internet and the foscam app for my android devices.  Setting up the email alerts was easy once I figured out that I had to reset camera to factory defaults, start over and then setup email.  Foscam support says that Gmail is not supported but it is and works fine with this model.

The older of the two not supporting wireless N or WPA2 encryption.To check this, if you look on the bottom of the camera, there should be 2 stickers with MAC ID's. The smaller sticker is for the wireless. If it is VNT it is the older wireless G hardware. If it is FR it is the newer wireless N.This might not be an important feature for some, but for me I would have to run my network in G wireless mode which would effectively bring the speed down for all my wirelss clients.The bottom line is that Foscam should not be selling old Hardware as the Newer stuff.

After the initial screening questions the suggestions were do not use an extension cord, its is not an outdoor camera (true, it is not built for outdoor weather, but the web browser tool does have an 'outdoor' setting for viewing outdoors), your router must broadcast its SSID, and this will work only on wireless.  After this, Calvin took control of my system, changed my router to broadcast SSID and the camera worked.  He was helpful and courteous.  He was a pleasure to work with. He even took my browser to Amazon so I could do a feedback.The reason the SSID change fixed the problem was that it was getting dark and the IR cut filter no longer was being invoked and the camera was not re-booting.What finally fixed the problem was I simply rotated the lense 1/8 of a turn.  This must have loosened something (perhaps the mechanical IR cut filter) and the camera started working fine.I am now very pleased with its function, clarity and for keeping watch for critters in my garden the vivid colors are very helpful.

I will start by saying the design is seriously flawed. There is virtually no way to mount discreetly (the mountings they give you are hideous and bulky and depending on where you want to put the camera, still useless).As for set up, thankfully my husband got it all working but it did take him a fair amount of time (and he works in an IT department!). I would wager unless you are technically inclined, this would be a nightmare!I find the feed rather slow/delayed at times which can be frustrating. It's not 'the end of the world' but it's still annoying. I also don't enjoy how many times I need to 'refresh' my browser when this is on. It times out after 'x' amount of MINUTES, so I need to go back into it and refresh it to get the feed back. THE biggest issue however, which is why I would NOT recommend this to anyone, is how many times the camera needs to be 'reset' (simply by unplugging it and plugging it back in). I find that annoying in itself that there isn't a 'reset' ON the camera, and you are forced to locate the plug and do it that way. When you want to sign in to view, an 'unable to connect' screen comes up and you need to go into the room, and unplug it and plug it back in - which makes the unit pointless since we want to view our children's room WITHOUT going in! We need to 'reset' it just about daily and it's very random as to when it will happen so I would NEVER use this for actual security purpose or you could lose out on valuable surveillance just because of it's poor quality.I also don't like the fact (as far as I know) there is no app from Foscam for a smartphone. You need to use a 3rd party app which seems highly insecure to me so I log in through the internet on my phone which then disables the camera's adjustment functions so unless the camera is set up exactly the way you want to see it, you're stuck staring at whatever it happens to be pointed at.All in all, not thrilled. I don't completely hate it but the more I have it, the more I dislike it. We've only had it maybe 6 months and it seems to heat up quite a bit and the 'reset' needs to take place more and more often.

Enable wireless access, disconnect the wired connection, look in your router/modem's setup and there's another address (\"Y\"). This is the one you need to use if you plan to access these things remotely via their wireless interface.You may be saying \"Well, duh,\" but everything that you attach to your network shows up in the router/modem's setup and in my case there was no information provided that let me determine which address belonged to which device, so I didn't notice the change/new address at first.Bottom line is that it would be best to write down all the addresses shown in your router/modem's setup and, as you add each camera, write down the new address that appears when you attach it wired, and then the new address that shows up when you switch it to wireless access. This last address is the one you will use when you open the ports on your modem/router to allow remote access.I recall reading complaints about the noise that the camera makes when it turns on the IR LEDs, and it does, indeed, click quite loudly. When I first started using mine, it would automatically turn on the IR when the sun set, which is not what I wanted (mine are looking out windows for daytime monitoring, and the IR just bounces off the glass and blinds the camera), but once I started using the Android version of IP Cam Viewer by Robert Chou and manually shut off the IR, they now stay off.

I wondered why this 18910W, with lower model number, would be more pricey and have some better reviews, so I bought one.  A few caveats:  the Amazon page advertising says:  \"Built to last with solid construction, wireless 802.11 N, IR-cut filter and 2-year warranty.\"  But at another place it says wifi b/g.  So which is true?  On my multi-router network, it will NOT run on the 'n' only router, but will run on the older b/g router in another area of the house, wirelessly.  If I turn the 'n' only to 'mixed' b/g/n  then this camera communicates.  So, I'd say the  \"wifi n\" is false advertising.  The box it came in also said \"wireless n\".  In other areas,  I'd agree with others that its color is probably better than the 18918W.  But the clarity appears the same or not as clear, subjectively speaking.  Its sound doesn't appear to be any more static-free, unfortunately.  It has a cleaner, simpler web interface.  Surprisingly loud little built-in speaker. Good mic level, but audio artifacts seem to plague Foscam.  Audio is understandable, but the noises can be tiring if trying to monitor a child or someone for safety.  Setup is not difficult but I avoided their disk, and set it up on cable first.  Just remember there are  two different MAC addresses: one for wireless and one for wired, so if you are assigning ip addresses from your router by MAC address...

Already a little paranoid about the little executable files you have to download and accept in order to view/hear this camera, when the Chinese espionage in this country is rampant enough, so I deactivated (i hope) their free service which helps those who don't have another option to find their home's ip address while traveling because some provider like ATT takes your  DSL's static ip address away without warning so they can later try to collect $15 per month for this 'luxury' but I digress.  I'm just leery of some corporation or country being the 'mother ship' that handles this privacy issue.

I especially like the fact that I can control the camera with either my iPhone or iPad. Overall I have been very satisfied with the camera and its featuers. The setup is a bit technical, and I still have not been able to get the camera to transmit the feed when not connected to the same wireless network, but I assume that is due more to a lack of time on my part than the camera's fault.One thing I do have to mention however is how horrible Foscam customer service has been. As stated, I initially bought this camera as a baby monitor and security camera for my daughter. As she has gotten older it has become more viable to mount the camera up on the wall so as to get better coverage of her room so that I can check on her when she's playing. To my surprise, when i went back to mount the camera with the included mounting bracket, I find out that the included mount did not securely fasten the camera to the wall mount, which allows the camera to rotate freely on the horizontal axis. This makes the wall mount virtually unusable. If I wanted to mount the camera on a vertical wall, the camera swings around freely so that the heaviest part of the camera is closet to the ground, thus making the camera's Pan and Tilt functions useless.After going to Foscams website I realize that the mount they included with the camera works ONLY with the FI8918W cameras, and does not seem to fit the FI8910W. Further evidence can be found on Foscam's website in that if you buy a 2-camera bundle of the FI8910W cameras, the bundle includes a completely different wall mount than the one that came with the camera I bought, which shows that they have obviously already found, and corrected this problem with new purchases. Thinking of course that this should be an easy fix, I emailed Foscam to notify them of the problem with the included mount, in hopes that I could get a replacement sent out that would work with my camera.Here is the emailed reply:we can send you a new standard wall mount.you will have to pay for the universal mounting bracket.Best Regards,XXXXXXXX.Abysmal customer service.Camera - 4.5 stars; Customer service - 0 stars.", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "I loved it for 50 days, then, it died...!", "Author": "Sir Einstein A.

I've had two of these camera's in place for just over a year now and have been very happy with them. I use them at my home with one covering the front entrance and the second one covering the rear porch/yard area. Both camera's perform well for both day and night operation. Unlike older model camera's, these have an infrared filter that moves into place when it gets dark. Daytime operation is full color while night time operation is black & white only, which is normal for any infrared type camera system. Video is a standard MPEG4 with embedded audio capability if desired. This model can be used either CAT-5 wired or wireless operation using 802.11g with all current encryption methods. It is NOT \"n\" capable but obviously will work on an \"n\" router if the router is set to allow such connections. Can be a pain to set up initially but once set up it works great. One thing I've notice about both camera's is they reset at random times for no apparent reason. They come with a 5-volt \"wall wart\" style DC power supply that usually requires the use of an extension cord because the power supply cable is rather short. Some have suggested the use of an extension cable causes random reboots because of a drop in the 5-volts required for proper operation. However, only one of my two camera's use an extension cord, yet both have this random reboot issue just the same. Have never figured out why they do this so I just live with it, as a full reboot takes about 45 seconds before the camera returns to the predefined position you set up in advance. For me it's not a major issue but for some it might be, as it could occur just when you need video evidence the most!Recently there was a newer model (FI9820W) that came out which offers 720p HD video, H.264 compression and an incorporated SD slot (not sure if it's standard SD, mini or micro) for on-board storage if desired and I believe 802.11n wireless capable instead of g-only wireless. I'm thinking about upgrading to this model but I understand through that particular model's reviews it has it's own set of issues as well. I guess \"we'll see\" :)If I had to buy this camera over again I'd do it again I think because for what it is it's still a decent camera for the price, and now it's even cheaper than it was a year ago when I purchased mine so they're an even better deal now :)Please comment if you've got any questions about this camera and I'll be happy to get back to you, as I'll receive an email anytime someone comments here.", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sound feature not Mac compatible", "Author": "crazyk", "ReviewID": "R3RIWHQW3I9FRD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for use as a baby monitor.

Burbano", "ReviewID": "R320MNB1Q7E19C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the cameras almost 2 years ago, when they just came out.  I moved from my parent's home more than a year ago and before I did I knew I wanted home surveillance over POE (the only thing this camera lacks that upsets me but I can read the specs so it's not like a surprise hit). I bought the cams early and left them in storage, a netgear POE switch, TPLink POE injectors and lotsa cat5e cables.  I tested it when it just got delivered and it worked beautifully. I have had it installed, not via wifi, bringing data from cable modem, to linksys router to netgear POE switch to TP Link injector to camera.  I did not want visible lines so I run the CAT5 through some paintable j-tunnels by the roof/wall joints and through 1/2 grommeted holes through walls.  I felt it's not home security if someone can run up to the camera and just unplug it. I have the vids/pics sent to FTP, email and record locally, can never have enough backups to the backups. The settings were easy to follow and those that weren't were resolved by their forums page on foscam.us. For well over a year now i have used it for about 11 months turning it on only when there isn't at least one person awake in the apartment, ie if everyone is sleeping, it is on as well.  I have it set that when it turns on it resets to the preset \"home\" position. Having gone through hundreds, maybe thousands, of reboots, it is sturdy.  Recently I have just left it on non-stop for over 2 months.  Video quality is not WOW, but it is not an HD model so it's not like it was unexpected.  In a house the quality is good enough to make out details in people's faces and clothes.  For outdoors I would not recommend anything other than 720p or even 1080p, but indoors in even a larger living room, which I have, the quality is good for what it is used for.  I used dyndns for remote capabilities and I use tinycam pro on my android for viewing the cams remotely or even when at home. Because I know my text message email address (for verizon it is cellphonenumber@vxtext.com) I send alerts also to my cell phone. There are a ton of good settings and you can program when to alert and when not to, if you have a set schedule. It allows alerts on movement, but my tinycam app also enables alert on sound threshold, which is weird since it is not available on the actual GUI on the cam itself.  In essence...great baby monitor as well. I have a bro-law that recently got a mobicam that says that you can remotely via the feed, which he liked so should my sister take a nap he could monitor the baby remotely as well as her.  Little did he know that it required you to have a pc, no mac, always connected via usb to the wireless monitor (lcd screen) and was only accessible via the mobicam website with 2 free hours a month or unlimited for $10/month.  Well a baby monitor is not an ipcam. The sound alert lets you select a threshold, so when noise gets above it, ALERT. Do only drawback I can find is that the GUI loses features on anything other than IE, like sound and multicam viewing.  The other drawback is that FTP saving only works for pics, to save video you need a pc connected as the cam doesn't, can't?, save itself so you need to be running the GUI and it saves on the laptop or network device.  With the number of usb android devices coming out, the tiny ones that fit on usb drives, I can see this not being to much of an issue, but it would have been nice to include ftp or dropbox.

I put this behind my front window next to the front door pointing outside. Since I'm not on the ground floor, the front door and window is the only easy entrance to my condo.The setupI can see this is not the easiest gadget to set up for non-techy folks. They come with just okay instructions, but the great thing is this thing is so popular, there are TONS of videos online on how to set this up and configure different options. Just Youtube the Foscam and you can find many step by step videos on how to set this up, configure wireless, motion sensor, and remote view.Motion sensorThis is what I mainly use my Foscam for. I want to be alerted if anyone is coming close to my condo. The Foscam only sends pictures and not video, and it takes about a minute to get it in my email inbox. Not great if you want instantaneous alert, but the pictures overall works decently well. I've caught delivery people, people coming with ads, friends coming, and someone loitering (she looked right into my Foscam and left, guess it worked?). It's also great that you can set your schedule to turn on/off the motion sensor at specific times (half hour intervals). Some observations though:- The motion sensor only works when objects are relatively close by. This works well for me since I have two of my neighbors' doors in my Foscam view but them going in and out never triggers the motion sensor. It only gets triggered when people are closer.- The motion sensor is very reliable during the day, but not so much at night. I have night lights outside, but still the Foscam motion sensor only catches me coming back at night about half the time.- The Infrared on/off triggers the motion sensor which can be extremely annoying. It took me awhile to figure out what was going on, but I found that with infrared on at night, turning on and off lights in the condo would turn the infrared on or off. Every time this happens the motion sensor would trigger and I'd get an email with useless images. I ended up turning infrared off because all I see with it was the reflection of my sheer curtains anyway.Remote accessNot the most straight forward to set up but again plenty of videos online with step by step instructions. Lots of apps out there also you can use (free or paid) to view the camera on your mobile devices. I have Foscam Pro ($6).

The pluses for the FI8910W is a good feature set, easy to set-up, a nice alarm feature that sends emails when motion is detected.Unfortunately, there are two negatives that result in our rating of two starts. The biggest issue is the photo's are too blurry to recognize anyone. For the motion it has detected so far, its been my daughter who uses the den a lot. While I know it is her, there is no way from the photo's the FI8910W sends to us that we could recognize her. The faces in the photo are way to blurry. We have the unit set to the maximum 640X480 mode and to be fair, perhaps at this resolution any camera will not allow faces to be displayed. But we did expect more out of the unit,The seond negative is once a day, the unit changes position and points at the ceiling. This makes the motion detection and photo's useless.

We put it at our cottage to check the weather and see any people or traffic going by. Since it rotates 300 degrees we can scan inside as well. We placed it in the front window.You don't need a PC after initial setup. Only a wireless router that the camera can use.Setup took about two hours but that includes everything to the point I could view it and control it from my iphone over the internet. Setup is not for a novice. But if you've ever set up a router and a wireless network at home you can handle this task. There are some excellent videos on YouTube that made the setup process easy. From box to viewing on my LAN took 10 minutes. Setting up wireless operation another 10. Getting it to work on the internet and then my phone took about a half hour of configuring and playing.....all with the help of the YouTube videos. Last I set up email motion settings which emails you one or a series of photos if motion is detected. This took about an hour of playing with the settings. Motion sensitivity is adjustable 1 to 10 from a leaf blowing across the snow on setting 2 to where it takes a delivery truck driving by on setting 9 to set it off.The infrared is nice. Our cottage is black dark at night but we can see the whole room fine even the objects 25-30 feet away. However if the camera is rotated toward the window with the IR lights on, you just see glare reflected back so the IR must be turned off to view the street at night. Simple toggle on/off switch.Notes on internet use:1. You must have a host domain setup through a domain service. There are free ones. I used DynDns. This is the \"website\" that your camera resides on. Again, refer to the YouTube videos. They talked me through it.2. The settings can be changed from hundreds of miles away over the internet once setup is complete. You can assign multiple usernames and passwords, at least 6, for administrators (full control and change settings), operators (view, pan and tilt control) or visitors who can only view without control. Very Nice feature.3. Only Internet Explorer supports multiple cameras. If you use Firefox or Safari you can only view one camera. Two or more cameras on your system would simply require opening Firefox twice, no big deal. I like Firefox better.Summary: High quality and excellent functionality! I am buying a second camera for my cottage rear window so we can watch the deer and wildlife while not there. And to see if anyone is snooping around. The camera will email me photos. The FI8910W is highly recommended.Update April 14, 2013. Loved it so much I added a second identical unit. After 6 weeks they are both running flawless. I can see what's going on at my cottage 200 miles away. I have them in the windows so I can pan and tilt to see inside or out. Daytime color and contrast is very nice. Night vision works great too. I take a peek every morning. I still love and recommend this camera! I really like the motion detection alarm that emails me snapshots of people and vehicles going by. Sensitivity is adjustable so I don't get everything that moves, just people on the front yard or porch. Also I highly recommend checking the setting \"email ip address\". Should your dynamic ip change, you can't access your camera. But the camera will email you the new ip address within a few minutes and you can redirect your URL to view remotely.

The step by step instructions from a previous reviewer \"R. Tickle\" were extremely helpful. I did have a few issues that I needed to sort out however. I use a Linksys WRT54G wireless router with HyperWRT firmware. Setting the static IP for the camera was tricky. I tried using the Gateway and DNS that was being reported in my router configuration screen and that gave me an \"illegal parameter\" error message in the camera configuration. Turns out I needed to use the typical http address I use to log into my router i.e. [...] for the gateway and DNS server. Changing the port from 80 (which is a public port that everyone uses) to one of the ports that Foscam recommends caused me to lose connection with the camera. Initially, I thought I did something wrong in the configuration and I kept resetting the camera. In fact, if you lose connection, you did it correctly. You are no longer connecting to the camera through port 80 (duh). I reconnected to the camera by typing in the static IP address I assigned to the camera followed by the port i.e. [...]=new port number you assigned to the camera. I also had a small issue with wireless connectivity. I use a MAC filter on my router. The camera had two stickers on the bottom with two different MAC addresses. I used the one I thought to be the correct one. Turns out it was the other one. Port forwarding on a Linksys is pretty straightforward so there were no issues there. Once configured, the camera works great. I use a web browser to connect to the camera from my work computer or iPhone. The picture quality is really good. The IR works well. Sound quality is OK but not great. There's a bit of lag when talking into a mic and hearing it on the other end. Not a show stopper though. Overall, I'm very pleased with this camera.

Apparently these reviewer simply put the Camera up and let it run. If you start to customize the device, soon you'll notice that the WebUI (Web User Interface the camera has a built in Website for viewing the cam image and configuration) seems to update your changed settings, but in reality did absolutely nothing that would make me think that it did. The alarm motion trigger setup is a nightmare, aside the fact that it doesn't update to the new settings, but you think it did. (meaning no error feedback)A friend of mine owns the same model and one night we been ripping our hair (what hair?) out trying to set his up so it would only send a text message to his phone. Bad luck, whatever he configured, it would rapidly send 6 images along, even though it unchecked that option. This is bad, bad, bad since his Phone provider would bounce it back to the sender. The result, absolutely nothing. Well, sometimes at the pleasing of the Camera it would sneak through, but very unreliably. In my own case I don't need to have an alarm sent to a cell phone. So I went to check out how my motion trigger would perform. I am still working on figuring out what the heck happened. I would trigger the motion sensor, stand there for about 60 seconds and then go back to see if e-mail was sent properly. If the e-mail makes it, I see a series of images, but none has me in the picture.I have a relatively fancy home network with public access to my web servers and e-mail server.

I did NOT install the Foscam software from the DVD.  Rather, I simply booted the camera to my LAN via an ethernet cable, logged into my router (Linksys E4200) and obtained the IP address that was assigned by DHCP to the camera by my router.  I then logged into the camera with IE and configured it with a static IP address, assigned an HTTP port, new user name and password and entered the security credentials for the wireless router. I set up port forwarding on the router and removed the ethernet cable from the camera, rebooted the camera to the wireless network, logged in and completed the configuration.  I use WPA2 encryption and my network has a fixed IP address provided by my ISP. Also, I unchecked \"Network Lamp\" which disables the flashing LED network signal lights on the back of the camera.I am quite satisfied with the Foscam, especially considering the low price. The pan/tilt function works well, motion detection performs as expected and the e-mail alert works reliably.  I have not used the audio, consequently, I can't comment on that function.  Nor can I comment on wireless range, because the camera is only 15 feet from the router. The image quality is quite mediocre, but I didn't expect much considering the price of the product.I access the camera with Robert Chou's IP Cam Viewer Basic (Android version) on a Galaxy Note II, which works very well. Overall the Foscam offers decent performance at low cost for my particular application.Finally, I can see how some customers who lack experience setting up routers and IP devices might run into trouble configuring this product, especially port forwarding.

I have four and while this particular one was a gift to a family member, I can attest that for the bang, this is the best camera on the market. Pan and tilt more than make up for the 640x480 picture resolution they provide. Plus, if you plan to monitor via a remote device like a cell phone, you don't want an HD video feed.I have also found that a lot of the complaints about these cameras are mostly \"user\" caused.  Improper set up and use of the router are the number one causes of complaints.  How do I know this?  Because I was one of them that constantly complained about the camera.  Then, I decided to do some schooling on networking and found that most of my woes were self-inflicted because I wasn't \"doing it right!\".While these are Wi-Fi cameras, I strongly recommend wiring them if they are going to be used for serious surveillance.  Main reason being is that there are so many things that can interfere with Wi-Fi and cause it to either fail or become very week.  The use of a microwave oven that is between the camera and your router is one of the main causes for camera \"loss of signal\". Again the camera gets blamed when in actuality, it's physics to blame.  Florescent lights also interfere with Wi-Fi.  Many homes use these now to save on power.These are also indoor cameras but I am using two of them outside. So far, no problems.  I do have them in a place where they are not exposed to direct moisture. They are under an eave and in a carport.

I needed to have a port forwarding service, which you know of if you've been reading these reviews. Without this service I could only observe my camera's feed through my home network and only on my home network.Do you need to pay for a subscription service? no! \"NO/IP\" has a free basic service with no special features that let me accomplish my requirements for a home IP camera. At first my connection wasn't working after the simple DDNS setup on NO/IP but that was my internet service provider blocking the connection through a firewall. I found online a PDF with instructions from my ISP giving me exact directions on how to allow the camera to operate freely on the network. I then typed the info from the instructions, rebooted the camera, and I WAS UP AND RUNNING.If connected to wifi, the new forwarding adress would not work, if not connected to wifi and running on 3G, the forwarding address WOULD work.BOTTOM LINE, MORAL OF THE STORY, I had everything I needed completed in less then a few hours!. The initial camera set up, IN MINUTES!I was also able to set up my gmail account to send me an alert email if motion is detected on my camera, and was able to program which days and times to send out these alerts.The IR feature works great, and the pan and tilt works great too, only downside is no zoom feature which would have been a perfect addition.

Until I started doing some research, I had no idea these cameras each encompassed a tiny computer and web server!  My mind was still back in the day when analog video went down a wire.I studied the reviews of this camera here on Amazon for a couple of hours, trying to figure out where most of the snags and pitfalls were, in advance of ordering.  For example, here is a handy tip from another user: \"If you want to use the preset camera positions you MUST first uncheck the \"disable preset\" box in the PTZ menu under Administrator.\"  You could spend hours trying to figure out the 'presets' without that little tiny tip.  Thank you!  Once I compiled a list of things like that that were likely to go wrong, and fixes for them, I ordered two cameras.It took me a couple of hours to get two of these set up, with my bare-bones knowledge of IP's, routers, and networking.You have to take the setup step-by-step, and test between steps!  Don't try to do it all at once! Once you get one function working, proceed to the next level.  There is a lot of useful information written in straight English on the Foscam site, so I hardly looked at the manual.The little program they supply called 'IP Camera Tool' is incredibly useful in getting things set up.I did NOT use the CD.  I just downloaded the latest firmware from Foscam, and updated that on the cameras once they were hooked up (one at a time) thru the ethernet cable.  There are two parts to the firmware, a \"System Firmware\" and a \"Web UI\" firmware. Update both. My cameras were one version behind.I was able to get video through the ethernet cable in a couple of minutes.  I set mine up as fixed IP's so their IP addresses would be a different numerical series than computers, but you don't have to do that if you don't know how.  Wireless setup was easy; once you set the IP, enable wireless, and reboot (the camera), you should pull the ethernet (NOT the power) cable.  The cam should then communicate by wireless after a minute or so.  Once the wireless was working, it was easy to set the motion alarm.  Once I got the motion alarm going, I had the system start emailing images to me (had the camera trained on a busy suburban street).  In order to test the email settings, you have to hit SUBMIT before you hit TEST, another little tip.  And when you see the mysterious words \"Network Lamp,\" that particular function turns the blinking green network light on the back of the camera on and off.Pretty soon I was getting more email messages than I could stand, so I set up a FTP service to a website I own where I can store the pictures.If you use Internet Explorer you are home free, you can view an array of cameras with one login, and monitor sound, too.  I don't like Internet Explorer, I use Firefox, so right now I have to login to each camera for live viewing.  There are plenty of free or cheap monitoring solutions out there.  Last night I tested out iSpy which seems to do the job of monitoring multiple cameras for not so much dinero.  Once I get it all figured out, I will settle down on a permanent monitoring solution.  But at first, you will just monitor through your Internet Browser.Setting up port-forwarding for worldwide-internet-viewing was pretty darn easy considering how much jabber there is in these reviews about it (You need to use a proxy, or go to the coffee shop, to test port-forwarding...I couldn't get it to work until I logged in with a proxy...found that tip on Amazon, too!).Everything is crystal-clear, with no noise.  The night-vision will light up a large room.Seriously, if you have no concept of what an IP address is, or you don't know how to access your router (and you don't want to learn), you should avoid messing with these cameras.  If you just want to run these on your own local network, and you know a little, the complaints about difficult setup are way overstated.These cameras are an outstanding value, but research carefully to understand the limitations before you buy one.", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good cam, easy setup - (Using AT&T; Ewire)", "Author": "Gameplayusa \"Gamer\"", "ReviewID": "R1VWIKW7UF1FCZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Foscam is quite a decent little camera for the price.

My kitchen was pitch black at night but the feed was crystal clear.AT&T; Uverse EWIRE SET UP:I have AT&T; Universe at home so I had to figure out how to access my router and forward the port assigned to the camera so I could view the feed remotely via the internet or my iPhone. The controls for AT&T; routers can be accessed by typing 192.168.1.254 into your browser when you're using the network (this means you have to do this while at home, it won't work if you try doing it from work).From there you need to find the FIREWALL option and then click \"pinholes and DMZ\". Step 1 says to select a computer and shows you a list of devices on the network. Find the ipcam and click it. On step 2, click \"add a new user defined application\".  For an app name, just type \"Foscam\". For protocol, make sure TCP is selected, and where it says \"Port(or range)\", type 80 in both the \"from\" and \"to\" fields. Leave the other fields blank and click \"add to list\" then click \"back\".The name \"Foscam\" should now be viewable in the Application list. Select \"Foscam\" and click the \"add\" button. That should associate port 80 with the camera and allow access to the camera feed from outside of your home or business. Now click \"Save\".To test, just type your_cameras_name.[...] into a browser and you should get the login screen asking you to type the cameras user name and password.One quick note, if you changed the port number for the camera, say to port 88, then your camera's address will become your_cameras_name.[...]SMART PHONE ACCESS:There are quite a few apps to choose from for viewing your camera feed on your smartphone but the best free one I manged to find was CamViewer. It was easy to set up and works great. It's comletely free, but if you want to enable sound, it costs $3 to do so.", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Doesn't store videos automatically", "Author": "Jorge Ignacio S\u00e1nchez Echevarr\u00eda", "ReviewID": "RDGCSYB1Q9717", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "In security aspect it's very important logging the actions that took place.

I got one a few weeks back on special for around $70 and even at regular price it is very surprising how well this works.  It took a few hours of fighting with my airport extreme router to properly forward the ports, but getting this forced me to learn how to do it and and fixed my Synology Diskstation's remote access at the same time.  People who fault this product because of difficulty in remote viewing are just wrong!  ANY device attempting to do this WILL have the same issues.  It's not a Foscam issue.The quality is adequate in absolute terms and outstanding if judged in the context of what this unit costs.  I have it setup on an Android phone, iPad and mac.  I use tinycam Monitor Pro for Android and Foscam's app on the iPad.  Tinycam is better.  The camera pans quickly and has a huge range of movement. There is no optical zoom, but both the Android and iPad apps lets you pinch to zoom.  The 2-way audio does work but is not great.  Think bad-webcam audio.  Probably ok for monitoring but it would be torture to have a lengthy conversation.Look - If I owned a business I wouldn't buy a bunch of these and expect hi-def, facial recognizing security, but for putting a few of these up around the house while you're out to give you peace of mind or to monitor pets, I think they're perfect.  They do make a higher def version as well and if I see one of those on special I may spring for it.

If you check out the manufacturer's forum, you'll see that many consumers, like myself, spent time troubleshooting the connection to the device. One reason appears to be that the remote viewing/control application doesn't recognize when it's been installed on a 64-bit operating system. You can fix the problem manually by adjusting a Shortcut and/or file locations and/or setting the app to run in compatability mode for an earlier version of Windows. But you should just be aware that installation generally is not fire-and-forget. Foscam could have invested a sheckle or two in software development, considering that the majority of new PCs sold come in a 64-bit flavor.Another issue is port forwarding. The device requires you create a port-fowarding rule for the device's IP address. That's not a deal-breaker for geeks, but most people probably don't know how to change the default password on their router, much less set up port forwarding. Just something to be aware of.Lastly, giving a device that's inside my private network exposure to being controled from the Web without the ability to disable that feature seems more like an anti-security feature than a security feature.

She was able to set up the camera in about 20 minutes by accessing my computer and taking over the setup. So far it has been working great but it's only day one. While on the phone I had the technician set up the camera so I could view it on my iPhone and ipad. This cost $5.99 for the foscam app but it works nicely and I have had no trouble remotely watching my home.  My only concern is that I was hoping to set up about 4 of the cameras and wondering if I will have to wait on hold each time to get them set up. But for the price it was worth it.I do want to address all the reviews that some are saying are fake reviews, which in a way they are, but they are for tech support, not the device itself.  At the end of the conversation she asked if she solved the problem and if I would review her performance. After I agreed, she went to the amazon site while still accessed to my computer and asked me to write \"tech support\" in the subject line of the review and say that she solved the problem. It's true but my hand was forced in the writing of the review, so I deleted it after we hung up. Don't let this turn you off though, the camera is good, pans easily and without making a sound, the images are clear, and overall it was worth it.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Difficult to set up but worth it", "Author": "Joe P", "ReviewID": "R3CK9NBQ10LRXW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had a hard time setting this up, particularly because there was an error in the printed instruction book that came with it.

But at the same time, we like the VOX feature which turned the monitor on automatically based on sound.So why did we decide to get this?First, we figured that if it didn't work out for us, we could still use it as a general security camera but if it did, we could save over $100 so we took the plunge and got this one.Second, with this camera, we can have many, many more monitors instead of a single monitor.  We even have retired Android smartphones sitting around that we've re-purposed as a dedicated monitor.  With our laptops, tablets, and smartphones, we have 6 monitor-capable devices.After sifting through the many, many reviews, I did have some concerns about the setup, but I have to say that for anyone that has any inkling of basic network setup, this thing is a snap to set up and install.  A *snap*.  If you have basic experience with networking, you're likely not going to need the manual, watch any tutorials, log into any forums, or call tech support for basic setup.That said, I'm docking 1 star for three shortcomings:1) The first issue is that the web interface looks terrible and unprofessional.  Mostly cosmetic, but it's not that hard to write some decent CSS.2) The second issue is that there's no way (at least that I've seen) that I can turn off the network activity lights.  This is very annoying in a baby's bedroom and requires some duct tape to fix.3) The mounting bracket requires you to drill into the wall.  If it had a flat, plastic back, it would allow the usage of the included screws OR the usage of something like a 3M command strip (in fact, if the manufacturer is reading this, I would recommend revising the mounting bracket and including a 3M command strip).A good piece of hardware and I would definitely recommend to other parents and will definitely consider purchasing additional units.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Quick and easy set up with amazing tecnical support NOT TRUE", "Author": "dahlia howe", "ReviewID": "REQXH2WXFFHLB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I spent countless hours trying to set up this camera it works fine locally but I could not get it to work remotely.

There seemed to be a few common complaints that I saw in the reviews.  First, the camera was difficult to setup.  Second, some users reported sound problems (too low, humming from interference, two-way audio not working).  Finally, there were a lot of complaints over the picture quality.  Please note: I am a Mac user, so all of my testing has been with OSX Lion, Safari, and a few third-party apps.Let me start with the first issue.  If you include hunting around for a place to plug in the camera I had this up and running and was logged into the built-in web server in about 5 minutes.  My major disclaimer is that I am a tech nerd with a networking background, so there's nothing in the setup that I found daunting.  To be fair to the average user, I followed the quick start guide that was supplied in the box and found that it worked perfectly.  The camera utility on the disk worked as advertised, and it got me right to the camera's web server without a hitch.  Normally when I hear complaints about things not working I always ask, \"did you read the manual?\"  Usually the answer is no.  So at least for the Mac setup, the manual is good and will get you up and running in no time.Second, the sound problems.  This is where I docked the FI8910W a star, but it's actually a software issue, not a hardware issue.  The built-in web server requires the VLC web plug-in for sound to work, but the VLC web plug-in for Safari does not work with 64-bit versions (the version a good number of people will have).  The VLC web plug-in for Safari has not been updated for several years, and it's unlikely that it will be actively developed in the future.  Basically that means sound from the built-in web server will not work for Mac users on 64-bit Safari.  I understand why Foscam went with VLC (it's free).  However, they screwed up big time when they didn't check to see if the VLC plug-in worked on current Macs.To test the sound I had to go to third-party apps.  I've tested the camera with EvoCam and SecuritySpy on the Mac, and FoscamPro on iOS.  For all three the sound worked perfectly, and FoscamPro's 2-way audio worked as well.  One of the complaints was interference in the audio feed, but I didn't notice any.  The gain on the camera's mic is turned up pretty high, so you do get a little bit of an audible hiss, but that's to be expected.  Any sound the camera did pick up was clear, and I could hear the TV show my wife was watching perfectly through all three of the apps.  The two-way audio via the IOS app also worked very well.  I had no issues with the sound being too soft as some users reported.Finally, the picture quality.  Here's where I stand firm and say, \"you get what you pay for, so stop complaining.\"  This is a sub-$100 camera, and considering all the features Foscam put into this product it makes sense that you don't have a 2- or 3-megapixel sensor in there.  It just wouldn't be economically viable.  The other side is that most people don't need that kind of resolution.  If resolution is really that important then you should be willing to spend more money on a higher end camera that meets your needs.  This camera is an entry-level camera, so don't expect it to compete with a $900 Mobotix M12.I was also pleasantly surprised at how well this camera worked with third-party apps.  The previously mentioned EvoCam, SecuritySpy, and Foscam Pro programs connected to the camera within a few seconds, and they were all able to control the PTZ and monitor audio.  I also setup the camera with Sensr.net's free trial, and that also worked flawlessly.Overall, this is a great camera for the price, and if you're looking for a starting point to dabble in IP cameras, or you're looking for a cheap monitoring solution in a non-mission critical environment, this is definitely the camera for you.  In only a few minutes I had the camera up and running, and over the next few hours I mucked around with a bunch of different programs until I came up with the perfect (at least for me) security monitoring system that includes motion detection, online backup, local recording, and automatic notifications.

It was the first time I did such a thing, but I do consider myself reasonably technically savy, and I learned a good deal doing it.- Besides using the free dynamic DNS host service provided by Foscam themselves (which is very nice of them to provide) to deal with the ever-changing IP address from my Internet Service Provider, I also signed up with [...] for a similar service, but this one allows me to automatically include the IP port on which I set up the camera (different from the default 80), so I don't have to type :XXXX at the end. It also allows me to have an easier to remember host name for the camera.- I liked that you actually don't have to install any software to connect to the camera remotely: once you have it set up, you can use a browser from any computer or mobile device, which is very cool.- The camera looks really good: nice texture and shape, looks like good quality, very silent when it moves.- Amazingly good price (<$80) for the features and  quality.Cons:- The printed manual that came in the box is quite sketchy. The full User Guide on the CD has a lot of good information, but it's written in very approximate English. Mind you, English is not my mother tongue either, but I tend to become suspicious of a product when it comes with a badly written (or translated) manual. Having said that, I've read some totally useless manuals in the past, and this is NOT one of them: you can actually follow the instructions despite its language shortcomings.- There is one feature which seems somewhat important and it hasn't worked for me so far: you are supposed to be able to define 8 predefined directions of view, and then just click one to have the camera pan/tilt to look in than preset direction. It just didn't happen for me, so I'm going to contact their tech support to see how to make it work. UPDATE: I got this feature to work! It turns out that it is disabled by default, and you need to turn it on in PT settings. The manual doesn't mention it, but if you go through the options in the web UI you can find it.- I went to the Foscam website looking for firmware upgrades (hoping that they might fix the problem above), but the link they give doesn't allow you to download anything: instead they ask you for your email address to send you upgrades, and they graciously warn you that they are going to spam you with future product offers at that email - no way to opt out of that. Searching the web for firmware upgrades, I just found a bunch of complaints from people who applied an upgrade only to have their cameras stop working, so now I am not that eager to upgrade anything now.Features not yet tried:- Setting up email alerts and motion/sound alarm. Will try it soon and update the review. UPDATE: I just tried it, and it was really easy setting it up to send motion alarm emails to my gmail account, following the snapshot from the manual. For some reason the first 3 tests failed, but then it started working. The manual doesn't explain this, but the alert emails are actually very nice: they contain 5 or 6 snapshot frames taken a few seconds apart, so you actually get an idea what is going on even before you connect to the camera. The email also contains a clickable link to the camera, so it's very easy to get the live video and audio feed. Pretty cool!- Setting up multiple cameras. If the alarm works, I am going to buy at least one more camera. UPDATE: given that the alarm works, I guess I have no choice but to buy another camera now :-)Bottom line: this is a really good product, with very few (and minor, imho) shortcomings.

I purchased the white version of this item, same model number, from a different source on sale.  I actually got two.  I put one in each baby and toddlers room.It took a couple hours going through their online videos at the foscam website to get this going.  I am running a Mac computer so I believe it is a little more difficult but I could set one up again in about ten minutes.You have to hook these cameras up hard wire ethernet to the computer first, which they provide, to initialize them or something and then you can do the wireless thing.  The picture is very decent and I have them hooked up using the small antennas.  Mine came with both small, about 4 inche or so long antennas and some that are like a foot long.  Both cameras are within 12 feet of my router.I didn't have much success using my apple time capsule because the last update got rid of some things that the instructional videos go over.  An updated instructional video would be nice.  I ended up using the main FIOS routerAnyway, there are plenty of mount options.  I mounted mine upside down and then checked the settings for flip and horizontal or something so that the picture is normal looking on my computer.I am happy with these and the pan/tilt feature.  I would have preferred a zoom feature as well but I did not look closely enough at the description.  They are kind of large in a bedroom if you are worried about looks.Here are the bad things.  If you have a mac, you can't put more than one camera in one browser window at a time.  It is not a supported feature. If you run windows, you can have multiple cameras tiled in one browser window.  It isn't a deal breaker for me but it is annoying.  The other annoying thing is that the Windows system has more options and has the listening function and speaking function from the computer and Mac does not.  There is a claimed work around for two way audio with Mac but I have been unable to get it to function.  The way I get around it is that when I am using chrome, I just have a tab at the top for the baby's room and one for the toddler. I click it and it opens a window and I press another option and the video pops right up.Either way, the infrared lights are more than bright enough in total darkness to see everything.  There are presets in the software that allow you to pick a spot and then just go back to it by selecting the number of the preprogrammed spot. You can move the camera all around and then just press the number and it zooms back to your spot.  The speed at which it can go vertical, horizontal, etc is all individually adjustable.The microphone is extremely sensitive. I can hear the baby breathing from about six feet away maybe 7.It is normally a color camera until it gets too dark and then it becomes black and white.  the infrared Leds can be turned on or off from the computer or phone appMy favorite function I believe is the operation from my android phone.  I am using Ip Cam Viewer basic (actually upgraded to pro for $4, I forget what extra features there are) and I can pull up both windows on my huge galaxy note 2, 5.5 inch screen at one time.  There are many camera apps out there.  All you have to do is put in the correct IP address and port.  Pick your favorite app.  You have to select one window though if you wish to hear that particular camera microphone or do any panning, scanning, tilt, etc.  This application allows full control over the camera and has preset locations as well.  Both the computer and the android app allows automatic up/down constant scanning, or left right or kind of a zig zag pattern.My wife and I don't go out much due to the kids.  The last few times we have gone out we put both kids down to sleep at night, and have the 15 year old babysit. He really only has to be there in case they wake up or there is a fire.  So while I am at the restaurant that most likely has free wifi, I have my phone with its kickstand open an I am able to view my children live to see what is going on.  If the toddler starts to get up and take his diaper off to pee all over  I can call my son and have him intervene.  Or perhaps the baby is crying too much and I am able to hear this.  I can easily operate the cameras to move wherever.  I mention free wifi because I believe this live camera feed with chew up your data pretty quick on your phone planIt is great piece of mind so that we don't have to open the bedroom door to check on the kids and risk waking them up.As far as the cameras go, they do seem kind of flimsy.  They are definitely not outdoor cameras and I have no idea how long the motors will last.I would look for something smaller and maybe a little more rugged next time along with something that has a zoom feature.FYI, one of my cameras does work with the two way audio and one can only be used to listen to  the baby's room: it will not amplify sound from my android phone when I select that option.

Don't buy into their marketing and just got with the free service. I'm not sure about dysdsn though.Audio quality. I'll admit that the microphone on this camera is crap. Trying to hear anything not close to the camera is pretty much impossible. However, the speaker on the camera is not as bad as people say. I can hear and understand when people talk through it.Interfaces. So far I've tried the web interface for Chrome, the android web interface, tinyCam pro for both my phone and nexus, and the blackberry browser. All interfaces allowed me to view the stream And adjust the camera. It works great over 4G and 3G and of course wifi.Overall, you have to remember that this camera is only $90. For that price, it did most everything I expected it to do, as well as I anticipated.

The unit is about 5\" high and the base is 4\" diameter.Second impression - it's made of cheap looking plastic. I paid $75 for this camera so don't expect much - just stating the facts. If it's dropped - I have no doubt the case will crack. Easy fix - don't drop it right?As per previous reviewers comments, I set it up via the browser and not the included software.The setup was relatively easy - but if you're not tech savvy - it would be difficult. In fairness, the included software might be recommended for those folks.Though a fair about of knowledge is required to set it up, there are certain things that could be made easier. For example, the setup for emails. Easier setup and help there would make it easier.Now on to the camera itself...the resolution is 640x480 is not great. There's a lag between what's happening in front of the camera and what's shown on the browser. This is locally. If using a remote software over the net, the lag will be more. It's functional, but don't expect to pan it left/right to follow someone around in real-time - not happening.The browser interface is ok - but as written before, certain features could be made easier. You can use this interface on your mobile browser and see the camera. It works but not usable because the page resets every time you do a pan/tilt action. So most probably will need to buy an app.The unit came with the network cable (to connect to router) - very helpful!

Superior to most baby monitors and many security monitors on the market* Full pan/tilt/zoom!* Viewable in the home (via wired/wireless network) OR outside the home (via Internet/smartphone apps)* Many compatible smartphone apps available (netcamviewer free on iPhone)* Basic in home setup is simple, but outside viewing more complex.  But resources/instructions available* Tech support via email or phone.  Email is more effectiveDetailed Review:Like many, I researched many models before deciding that the Foscam was right for me.While the setup is slightly more complex than some solutions out there, you are more than paid back with a network camera that has clearly superior night vision and daytime picture.  You also have full pan/tilt ability and the option to set this up wirelessly or wired.There are very few network cameras that offer these features and, in this price category, probably none.Since I've shared my experiences, friends have bought this camera and used it effectively for baby camera, pet cameras, and home security.Customer service is solid and when one camera stopped working, it was immediately replaced with an RMA unit since I was in the 2 year warranty.  There are also great instructions on how to set this up so you can view it from your smartphone and outside your home network.  The customer support is also more than happy to give you tips via email.  I consider myself fairly computer savvy and was able to set the first one up after about 1 hour.  I've since bought two more.Note: Certain packages contain a super long antenna for increased signal that is included free.  While I was able to get a solid signal with the shorter, standard antenna, I did get noticeably quicker image and smoother video with the Foscam Wireless Range 9dbi Antenna Expander for Foscam IP Camera.  It's a great add-on if you can find the right package.  There are also bundle packs with more than one camera if you know you want to buy bulk.  Price is about the same or slightly cheaper. Eg:Foscam FI8910W Black 2-pack Pan & Tilt Wireless IP Camera with 9dbi AntennasUpdate: The camera does make a clicking noise as it switches from daytime to nighttime mode.  Occasionally, if the lighting is just right and between twilight and dusk, it can get momentarily stuck and click multiple times as it decides which mode is best to use.

After trying to read their poor-grammar \"quick set up\" instructions for an hour, I gave up and called an expert.  I did not try to call the company.  It took my friend who is an IT manager 15 minutes to set the camera up to wireless and another 5 minutes to help me set up the Foscam App that I downloaded from itunes for $5.99.  (There are tons of other IP camera apps out there for free but I just thought I should go with a product specific app.)If you don't plan on using this product wirelessly, you will need to purchase a longer CAT5 cable.  The one in the package is about 2 feet long and intended just for initial set up use.  They make a version without the antenna if you don't want to go wireless.THE CAMERA - it is very quiet, responds fairly quickly to remote commands (pan and tilt) and, so far, has never lost its wireless signal. I cannot find anywhere in the packaging that this product can be used outside.  The power cord is very short (about three feet).IMAGES - Infra Red - Can't shoot through a window at night, it just reflects the IR lights in the window, so I would suggest getting an infrared light and placing that outside your window if you want to monitor at night.  This camera has the capability of turning the IR lights off manually.  We have a street light in front of our house and you can see the light at night with the camera but you wouldn't be able to make out faces or car colors without the addition of an extra IR light outside.Daylight images - Great and are better resolution than I expected.  It has a built in adjustment for outside photographs and self-adjusts the contrast.  From the monitor on your computer screen, you can only pan an tilt.  But you can zoom with the ITunes Foscam app, and take pictures and video straight to your phone.MICROPHONE AND MONITOR - Wow!  I did not expect this feature.  With the Foscam iPhone app, I can talk from my phone through the camera.  I can also listen to the room through the monitor. I LOVE both of these features and did not see them listed when I purchased the camera.***** I was originally going to rate this product four stars because it is so difficult to set up but after using the camera for a week, I just love it and I'm rating the camera, not the set up.  The set up is difficult so if you don't know an IT person or can't figure out how to set up a static setting through your router after determining the camera's IP address, you're going to need to call technical support and I can't speak to that experience because I did not try it.

Not knowing whether or not that was true... I took a leap of faith and bought two of these cameras.  I absolutely love them.  No, they aren't HD.  No, they aren't top of the line.  YES, if you want to set up remote viewing, you have to be somewhat knowledgeable about router settings and DNS. (If you don't know what a router, IP, or DNS settings are.. don't expect to have remote viewing, just in-home viewing via the provided application)  The IR only REALLY works for about 3-4 feet, so don't expect them to see in the dark.  Given all that, show me a better camera for <100.00 that has a 300 degree pan/viewing angle!  I don't regret this purchase for even a minute and plan to buy additional cameras including outdoor models.  That \"static\" interference that some people have mentioned on the audio out is true.  You have to keep the volume to a minimum effective range on the connected speakers to prevent a loud buzz.  I imagine this is a grounding or interference problem with the wireless and there might be a work around.All in all.... I love these!*****Update:  In the original review, I mentioned that the IR only worked for 3-4 feet.  That is incorrect.  When it's working correctly it illuminates the entire room! The trick is getting it to work correctly. One of the two cameras I have works fine all the time. The second one needs a little coaxing. When it turns on correctly, it makes an audible, distinctive, \"click\", presumably from the IR filter. When it doesn't fully engage, the click is a quieter, incomplete, click. I read on a forum that if you hold a relatively strong magnetic (speaker magnet, hard drive magnet) just above the camera, you will hear the click complete and the IR works great. I spent some time turning it off and on, coaxing with the magnet when needed, and it appears to have improved.  Almost as if it just needed to wear in a bit.  Regardless of the price, only shoes should need to be worn it! As such, I'll probably move the rating to a 4 for this.

I find that it lives up to its strong reviews.I'm writing to give a few details about setup, since that seems to be the main issue that people are having.  Some say that you need a PhD in order to set it up.  I'd like to say that I'm PhD-free, and the setup went smoothly.  BUT...I also consider myself fairly comfortable with adding a variety of network devices to my wi-fi network.  Here's what you should know:1) If you just want to be able to access the camera from elsewhere on the same network (say, for example, you want to set the camera up in one end of the house, and monitor it from the other end), then setup is pretty straightforward.  The directions, though written in somewhat choppy English, walk you through the steps.  First, you connect the camera to your router using a wired connection, install some software for managing it, and then just follow the steps.2) ON THE OTHER HAND...if you want to be able to access the camera from outside of your network (say, you're away on vacation and want to monitor your house), the setup gets a little more technical.  If you've never been in the \"aministration area\" of your router, and if you are not familiar with what \"port triggering\" is, then you might want to find a friend or family member who knows that side of things.  The directions DO walk you through the process, but the process will vary depending on the router you have.  I'd like to say that patience will prevail, but I'm quite certain I know some people who would NOT be able to get this set up on their own, simply because they are used to devices that just plug in and work.3) One other point, for those who care about this: Most internet providers give most of their customers a \"dynamic\" IP address.  Or, put another way, most of us have an IP address that changes periodically.  This could make it tricky to access a device like this when you are away from home.  To Foscam's credit, they give you what is needed to work around this limitation.  My camera came with a 3-year unique domain that will allow me to access my camera, even though I have a regularly changing IP address.  Basically, they give me an address of the form xxxxxxxx.myfoscam.org.  The \"xxxxxxxx\" gets filled in with a domain identifier that is unique to my camera, and is stamped on the bottom of the camera.  There are other workarounds when faced with a dynamic IP address, and I will change to one of those once the three years are up.4) With the camera up and running (which took me about 15 minutes), I like how easy it is to access it.  From anywhere I want, I can monitor the camera, move the camera around, and configure the camera's settings.  The interface is a bit quirky sometimes (sometimes the controls don't work as expected, but mostly they do).  But all in all, I really like it.Be cautious about getting this camera if you are not comfortable learning to work with your router (unless you don't plan to access the camera when you are away from its network).

The wireless reception is strong and I can operate the camera from my Samsung Nexus Android phone. I love the ability to pan, I wish it had some ability for optical zoom - I'd be willing to pay more for that. The image resolution is pretty good, but I wish it were better so that I could digitally zoom in on the bird house or a license plate. Best thing of all is that the motion detection sensitivity works very good (blowing leaves do not set it off) and it emails the snapshots to my Gmail account nicely. Setup for all of this did take about two hours because it is complicated to make all of this work.

In fact I looked around for a few months before finally deciding to give these a try.All of the people saying they work in IT and still can't figure these cameras out.. get a new job, or don't lie (I really do work in IT). I went the wired route, but I don't think I'd have any more trouble with the wireless.To set these up, I do recommend knowing about router and port forwarding (if you plan on viewing these on the go.) To get the basics up.. just plug the camera into your router (or I used a switch.) The cd foscam package's with the camera comes with a tool that will detect the IP address of the camera. Or, like I did, went to my router to find it.  Then simply type the address into your browser (I will warn IE often is finicky about typing in IP addresses, so try chrome if you have problems.)  The camera has a built-in web-server, once you type in the address and install the active x plugin (for IE, but you can use other browsers) everything you need is there.I bought two of these to use in the kids' room.  They work perfectly for this. Night vision works well.In regards to using this from outside your network.. the instructions come with a so-so guide on how to use port forwarding.  Its really not all that difficult, my router has instructions on the port forwarding page as well. As for dynamic IP addresses, well for that you do need no-ip or some other service. However, I have cable internet.. and I can't tell you the last time my IP changed so for me it isn't an issue. But don't be too afraid of those services, there are reputable companies out there that have no relations with foscam and don't care to spy on your cameras.Edit:  For the people claiming the 5 star reviews are fake,  I can assure you this one is not. Unless these cameras suddenly die, I am very happy with them. I think a lot of people get frustrated because they can not set them up and unfairly rate this product down and assume all the good reviews are fake.UPDATE: 1-29-13  Dropped rating from 5 star to 1 :(I bought two more of these cameras a couple days ago because I loved the first two so much.  Well the two new ones came with new firmware YAY! (NOT!).  While the cameras still seem to work just fine, Foscam has included a new \"feature\". They have their own DDNS service built into the camera now.  Which, this would be fine and dandy except its very difficult to disable. There is no option to do this ANYWHERE in the admin panel. The only way is to issue a cgi command via the browser (there is a post how to do this on the foscam forums.)  However, if you don't disable this before connecting it to your network.. too late because foscam already has your ip and has the DDNS service set-up. You can change the port and then the myfoscam url won't be able to access it directly, but if someone wanted to try and guess your port, presto.  Why? Because UPnP is turned on by default now, which forwards the port automatically.I'm not feeding into the conspiracy theories about Foscam wanting to spy on you, rather, I think they made these changes to make things easier to set-up and manage.  But for me, I knew how to set-up and use these so it creates an unnecessary security risk.Foscam: MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO DISABLE THE DDNS SERVICE AND TO REMOVE MY IP FROM YOUR SERVICE AND I'LL CHANGE MY RATING BACK TO FIVE STARS.Edit: 5-1-13  Back to 4 starsFoscam has made it possible to disable their DDNS service.

It's obvoiously not very discreet looking, but that's ok for me.I like the motion sensor features so that I don't have to stare at the cameras all the time. I get an email notification when it detects movement.One disappointment is that I can't view through the front windows with the camera, it just looks all white and washed out from the sun. I suppose that's an issue with most cameras. I tried the outdoor settings, but it didn't help.For the price, these cameras are great.

I was able to successfully setup the camera wired and wireless without any problems. I don't have any background with networking configuration at all but I do admit, the instructions included need to be a little bit more detailed. I assigned a permanent ip through my router (I have AT&T; U-verse/2wire) and had to reboot my router after connecting the camera through ethernet for setting up wireless since the wireless ip address did not show automatically in my devices list-the foscam camera has two different ip addresses for the wired and wireless, important to note that). And I was able to remotely access the camera in my ipad and iphone through the $5 app as well as hosting it through No-ip for free after updating the firmware to the latest. To access outside of my local network like when I'm at work, all I need to do is type my external ip address with the opened port on the browser to access the camera. I'm thinking of upgrading my no-ip membership to the $9.95 a year one for a more-hassle free dynamic dns.For port-forwarding, I created a rule to host port 8090 through my router and so far no problems. I created usernames and password for family members who are overseas  and assigned them as \"visitors\" in the user settings and they were able to access the camera using my external ip address and port just fine.Quality of the image is alright for the price.

The night vision is amazing. The microphone is very sensitive - maybe too much so, as I have to turn the volume down a click or two on my iphone so I don't hear the background noise. We're using a foscam app on the iphone and we use it as the monitor. You can pan the camera, speak through the camera and record video through it. You can also set it up to run in the background like a phone call, so you can use it as an audio monitor (and it doesn't suck the battery life of the phone as quickly). You can still receive a phone call (it just kills the app). So far it looks like just under an hour of constant audio and video up on the iphone screen used about 25% of my battery. When I put it in the background so I just heard the audio constantly (the screen was off) for over an hour and a half it used about about 15% of my battery. You can use your browser to monitor the video, as well, but on the mac, there is an issue of the audio not working in the browser. When on the computer I use the application VLC to monitor the audio and video. It works well, but of course, you can't use the camera controls (move the camera) or speak through the camera.So, it has its flaws, but for what we're using it for, it is pretty awesome and much cheaper than a lot of the better video baby monitors.", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "High Quality Good Price", "Author": "AverageJoe", "ReviewID": "RGZUNWTCEN6AY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had only used Axis cameras before purchasing this item.  Although the reviews here are very positive, the comments led me to believe this was a cheaply made product, albeit at a good price point.  My take is a bit different...  I am very impressed with the build quality and the performance of this camera.  Just for reference, an Axis PTZ camera will set you back about $1200 dollars (12 times the price).  While the Foscam camera lacks a zoom feature, it has self contained invisible night illumination and the Axis does not.If you are using the camera for home or office where the distances are reasonable (as opposed to a warehouse or big box store where you need to zoom in on a shoplifters hands), this is your camera.  The 24 hour ir illumination will cover a room or hallway nicely at night when the room lights are out.The product came nicely protected and included a CD with mac and pc instructions, a paper easy start guide, a sturdy adjustable bracket for wall ceiling or tabletop mounting, and a neat retractable spool ethernet cable.  The camera body has a nice matte finish.  The instructions are clear and thorough, although setting up any wireless network camera with internet access could throw a newbie into a tailspin.

I only had this cameras for a couple of hours, and I have pretty much setup everything that I need to do.  Btw, nobody forced me to write this review, and I do not work for Foscam, so this is a serious review. However, there are caveats...I am an IT professional, so even though I had to tinker with that a bit, it's not that bad to setup if you have some tech knowledge, here are some pointers that you should know before buying and setting this camera up:1)  If you have a dynamic public IP address (which what most home internet users have)  you will definitely needs a dynamic DNS (DDNS) service. Good thing is that you can use a free third party one.  Forget what people say about dyndns and how crappy/not free it is, the new version has \"no-ip\" support out of the box, and it's free it's great. That way you don't need to run the no-ip DUC (desktop client on your PC) all day.2)  Yes, you will need IT experience, or pay a friend who knows his stuff or buy him a case of beer so he can set it up for you.  This is not some \"plug and play\" device at all, but for me it was fun to tinker with.  This is a standalone \"web server\" camera not some silly (paid) cloud service that someone can guide you through ever step of the way.  To setup, It's best to plug in the ethernet cable into the camera, find out what dynamic private IP it grabs from your DHCP server on the LAN, and configure via a web browser from there, and setup that IP as static.  Skip the software, I didn't even touch it.  Then, you will need to setup the wireless, then the port forwarding on your router/firewall so that you can access this (or a domain name mapped to a dynamic IP service in #1 above). Good thing is that the camera will forward the public IP to your email.  be sure to setup a non-standard port (not port 80) for this camera.3) sound is terrible...but I don't really need it that much.  the volume is too soft, and the audio support in the software sucks on the web GUI. However, I will deduct a point for this in my review4) The case is cheap glossy plastic (non ABS), and it feels flimsy.  Definitely do not drop it. However, this is only the aesthetic complaint of this camera5)  The ipad/iphone support is not included...you can get a paid version, but it's a few bucks. A lot of cheapskates complained that Foscam should've included this, but oh well. But, if they had looked harder there are plenty of free Foscam software in the app store written by others that you can use to access the camera. I went and got the foscam pro app for a couple of bucks. It works without errors. I was impressed and how easily it sets up.  I was able to guide my wife through this over the phone on her ipad, and I didn't have to hold her hands. Super.6) Some menu descriptions (or lack there of) made the configuration hard to understand.  But, a few google searches answered my questions.  I would deduct half a star for that lack of clear documentation.7) the motion detection works...just needed to make sure the file upload is unchecked (ftp), or else the email portion doesn't work.So, overall, I feel for the price it's a pretty decent IP cam.  The app didn't crash on the web gui or the iphone/ipad which is a big plus. I have had an IP camera in the past (Sony), and I was not happy at the glitchy interface.  This worked right out of the box without problems.  I recommend this for any techie who is interested at a decent IP camera.

My initial impression was that the camera seems cheap, perhaps because of the material used (mainly plastic).  As long as it's not dropped, I think it will be fine.Pros:- Great picture clarity- IR cutoff is great of accurate colors in day and night- Pan/Tilt is great for viewing different angles- Wireless signal is exceptionally great- Good beginner software- Easy setupCons:- Made of plastic (feels cheap at first)- Bad firmware causing wireless function to fail (easy fix)I am not a PRO installing and configuring security camera, but after burglaries/vandalism in my neighborhood started happening, I decided that this would be a great investment.  The setup was extremely easy.  It is set to acquire DHCP, just connect the ethernet cord to your router, and power it up.  Check your router for the assigned IP address and then access the admin console of the camera.  You can also install the IP Camera Tool that is on the  CD.  The interface is good.  Simple.  I say this because I only changed a few things here: mainly to enable and configure wireless so it connect to the proper SSID of my network.  Be warned, if the wireless isn't picking up any SSID/Wireless network, you might have a bad firmware.  It took me a couple of hours to figure this out (I was almost about to give up on it).  The firmware you will need is 11.37.2.46 and Web UI: 2.4.10.2.  This is the best UI/Firmware I can find that is worth keeping for this device.  As mentioned, the interface is acceptable and thsi goes for the actual IP Camera Software you can install that will allow you to connect to your camera remotely and configure and setup alerts, etc.I do not use the software as I have other cameras in my property.  I use an Open-Source program call I-Spy.  This software allows me to define specific actions and trigger areas of the camera.  Meaning if I have the camera pointing outside in my drive, I can have an area to be monitored for movement.  Even if the wind makes the trees beside my driveway sway like crazy, it will not trigger an alarm as it is not within the trigger area I have defined.  In addition, I can also setup the software to trigger another camera in case one of the other cameras is triggered.  I have a DLink DCS-920 and I have two of these Foscams and I use one application to record videos/capture photos and audio.  Additionally, I only have the application set to record and when movement/alarms are triggered.  The application can also force the camera to track movements which means, if someone is walking, it will automatically pan and tilt the camera to follow the direction of the movement.I will update this review after a month of using the Foscam, but for now, I'm extremely happy with the purchase.", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lots of features for a great price", "Author": "Tech Buyer", "ReviewID": "R3K5GD88ZVELPI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was a little bit skeptical to but these cameras, they were too cheap, but buying through amazon is most of the times a good experience.

You'll need to create an account at a site like dyndns.org to be able to access these away from home (assuming you don't have static IPs).

Weaver \"PsychoDoc\"", "ReviewID": "R2XIITSP981OM0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here's a review for the fellow non-tech types:  First, you should know what this is not.  It is NOT a plug-n-play camera.  It requires fairly advanced setup.  Here is what I had to do, some of which was because my wifi hardware was REALLY old (an early wireless-g).First, I tried to get the camera on my old network, and ended up replacing my cable modem and my wireless router because the camera wouldn't even sync on to the network (it worked immediately on hard-wire).  Once I had the new network up, you have to follow the directions to get in to the setup software via a web browser, similar to any other wifi device.  Then it worked on wifi.  I can unplug and move around and it works fine.  Then, because I want to see the cam from outside my home network (e.g. when I'm at work), I had to sign up for a free outside service to host an address for my camera.  I had to sync all of the settings on my new wifi router to that outside host provider, which includes a procedure called \"Port Forwarding,\" not complicated, but not something you do every day.  Then, I had to find an app for my iPad and iPhones that will sync with Foscam cameras.  The one called FoscamPro is working brilliantly for me, but there are others, all in the $5-7 range.  That particular app will sign in to the cameras via that outside provider service when I'm away from home.  If I'm at home, it will find my camera within my wifi network IF I have what's called a \"static IP\" address assigned to my camera.  By default, all of my wifi devices actually run on \"dynamic IP\" addresses, meaning that my wifi router assigns a different \"address\" to them every time they sign on.  I had to \"Reserve\" my IP address for my camera, again a setting in my router.  Then, I could tell my app to go to that local address if I was at home and save the bandwidth from going to and from outer space to see my nursery.  I've never done any of this stuff before having to for this camera.Now, what I have is an incredibly clear view of the babies (twins, so a static camera is worthless), including presets that let me push buttons to zoom right to their faces.  The iPhone/iPad app also functions as a zoom for the camera, so you can see in very clear detail what is going on.  And, the camera can be moved all over the house with no problems whatsoever.  The audio from the camera is very static-laden and essentially worthless, but we have a regular baby monitor for when we want audio monitoring.  Everything works as seamlessly when I'm out on 3G as when I'm at home on my home network. Definitely go to the Foscam site and look through several of their much more detailed manuals for pretty good instructions that got me through everything.  Bottom line:  It's pretty complicated to set up, but probably far better than any other video option for a baby monitor, and it'll make a killer nanny-cam and security cam later down the road.

I started out by just buying this Foscam & one Dlink Camera.  I actually thought I was going to like the Dlink much more at first when I set them up given the ease at which the Dlink camera started up & synced.  Although the Foscam did require a bit more knowledge on networking (of which I might add.. i have none!) I did manage to figure it out after a successful tech-support call. If you want to access these cameras ( I actually ended up returning the Dlink and buying a second Foscam) outside of your network, you must learn how to forward an IP address. It really isn't as scary as it sounds for those of you who haven't done it before.  Don't shy away from this camera if you don't have a clue how to set up a forwarding of an IP address.  There are plenty of sites online to walk you through it, as well as the tech-support for Foscam does a direct link to your computer and can set it up for you remotely.The reasons I chose this camera over the others are #1, the remote movement.  I don't have to have it pointed in only one small location all the time. I can move it at any time I wish remotely, from anywhere I am.#2, it had a wider angle lens than the Dlink cameras which allows me to see more at one time#3, it has a much higher quality image (even when set at a lower resolution) than the other cameras.  Even at a lower resolution, the image it's self is clearer, and has MUCH better nighttime vision than some others i've tried.#4, it works nicely with 3rd party software for recording and uploading, no glitches, just works... \"it plays nice with others\"in conclusion.. i give it a 4 instead of a 5, just do to the complication of getting it set up.. but.. in the process i've learned how to do something that turns out wasn't hard at all!.. just something I hadn't learned how to do for fear that it would actually be hard.. and it wasn't .. just time consuming right at first... now all is wonderful and I couldn't be happier with my choice.

It actually was not that hard... you just have to pay attention to what you are doing.  Ill give you some advice. When they tell you to do \"port forwarding\", do not use the \"range\" option...... do each one indiviudaly. so in your router you will put in the ip address of the cam, then assign a port number. 8090 is a good place to start. So your cam will then be something like this if you are within network. 192.168.1.125:8090.  If outside, you need to get your router ip addess then the port number. So something like this. [...]Besides all that tech geek stuff, you will like the cameras. You can change the scan speed to very slow to surprisingly FAST or anywhere inbetween. and the range pan and tilt range is incredible. You will never feel like \"i wish it could go a little farther\".  You can also have the ir lights come on automatically when it gets dark or you can control them manually. Visability is great at night. May be more than 7 meters which is too far to see much detail anyway. Pic is clear day and night although the color is a little weak, however it does have auto iris control which is great cuz it adjusts instantly to bright light or shade. I have had mine outside under eaves for over 6 months with 0 problems.  Oh and i almost forgot. You can talk through them and listen to feedback which is great. No extra speakers or anything required. This is priceless... especially when the kids are outside doing something they shouldnt be!!!

A very tech savvy person with solid network background, I have tried every single option both on the camera and via multiple routers and my experience is the same as most others online.  After 4 days of trying to connect via wifi, I gave up and ran a wire to the camera instead.  The wired connection works and despite my woes with wifi, this camera, once it holds up, is a good buy compared to many other options out there.  I'm not a fan of CMOS cameras but this one looks just as great as my CCD ones.  Downloaded FoscamPro for iphone and everything works generally well except for an occasional audio distortion.

This from someone who has been a computer tech for close to 30 years.The first thing I figured out was that I needed to print out the manual that comes on the CD. The quick install pamphlet is good, but limited. You do need both to install the camera.One thing that they tell you to do is go to [...] and get a free domain name to use when you connect remotely. The problem is that company doesn't provide free domain names. The other options for domain names given in a list they provide in the software seem to be non-existent. At least I think that's what they're telling me... It's confusing and poorly explained.I'm currently connecting with the IP address, and it has worked from a location outside my internal network. I'm going to try using our domain supplied by Microsoft for our Windows Home Server. [...]. If it works, I'm set. If not, I'm looking for a place to get one. I'm not overly interested in purchasing a domain name just for the cameras. Of course if the IP address works consistently I don't have to.Their port forwarding screen and explanation are confusing, but it's port forwarding so what would anyone expect? I still don't understand why every explanation I find regarding this task confuses it more than necessary.As for the camera itself, I am very impressed. The pan and tilt range is excellent, the resolution is clear at 640x480, the color is crisp, and you can adjust the brightness and contrast. I think it has the ability to save settings based on what you choose, but I haven't tested that yet. Infrared is automatic when the light level gets low and is a clear image.It will email alerts (it can be turned on and off easily) and I have set up and tested this feature. It works well within limits, but I can't get it to successfully send a message to my wife's Gmail account even though it sends one to mine. This feature needs a better explanation in the documentation. It attaches six snapshots to the email, and you can get a bunch of emails with constant movement! I know this because I forgot to turn it off once after testing. Oops! The picture quality in the email is excellent.I have set up our smart phones (Android) access the camera and it works fairly well. The biggest negative is the speed of the connection, but that's the cell phone service. Picture quality is pretty good and you can control the pan, tilt etc from the phone. An app download is required. This is the one I use: IP Cam Viewer Free. There is a full version with quite a few features that are not in the free. I may be buying that one once things settle down on the PC side. $4.00I downloaded a plugin:[...] that captures the audio and it works, but is a bit noisy. I've read that static can be caused by the wireless antenna and the power cord among other things and that experimentation should resolve the issues. I did notice that it really picked up the the tick-tock from our mantel clock.The lack of the ability to get a domain name as explained, along with the apparent lack of concern about this on the part of Foscam, as well as the problems with sending email are the reasons for four stars instead of five.I will be purchasing more of these cameras in spite of these problems.Edit: I figured out the email for Gmail. There is this choice in the mail settings:\"Gmail only support TLS at port 465 and support STARTTLS at port 25/587.\"I initially used STARTTLS at port 25 and it wouldn't work.

I also played with my network and got it to where I can share and view all of my 4 laptops and 1 HTPC in the house and that's the extent of my network knowledge.I started my adventure at 7pm by hooking up the camera to the router and immediately found the IP address using my router login (I have uVerse all in one).  The CD software simply acquires cam IP address for you so it's definitely not needed if you know how to look around your router.  The issue I had was that I don't know if it was my network or my macbook or dell laptop but it was extremely slow.  I had to play around the adjustments, rebooting this and that and couldn't get anything.  But eventually, after taking a break and trying a different port, it finally came up!  I was then able to enter my wireless information and port forwarding.  I was able to view this camera using my home IP address, which is very cool!  Now another issue came when I unplugged the camera - for whatever reason, it would not work just on my wireless network!  Very frustrating.  This is where I am right now, trying to troubleshoot this issue.  Even with all this issue, I think this camera is definitely worth it.  Night vision is simply mind blowing.

I can monitor all of my cameras (and sound from them) live and I can set up alarms to have emails sent to me when motion and/or sound alarms are detected. I can also FTP images on alarm too.Positives+ Contrary to some other reviews, I thought setup was easy. And I DID use the included CD and software and I thought that software made it simple to install. I followed the directions to the letter and checked off each step as I completed them. No issues at all. You first connect them to your network with ethernet cable (one is included) to do the initial setup. Then you disconnect the network cable and do the wireless setup if you plan to use them wirelessly (all 4 of mine are running wirelessly). You then enable port forwarding on your router if it isn't already, and enable UPnP on the device using the devices web setup page. You just have to rename the port you plan to use (easy to do using the instruction provided). My setup was easier than most since I have a static IP. If you do not have static IP, you have to do extra steps for the port forwarding part.+ Image quality was better than I expected+ The night vision actually works great, I really like this feature when I use it+ Sound quality is not bad - you can monitor it remotely and hear what is going on, but the 2-way is crude (though does work)+ Mounting bracket and hardware are included+ Smartphone control works great. I currently use Surveillance PRO. Very simple to setup and use, and I like the mosaic view and you can turn on and off alarms and emails forwarding remotely with it. There are many other smartphone apps to choose from, I had trouble deciding which one to use and may someday try another one that has more features.+ I think these are a very good value for the money+ Long power cord (well with 3 of the 4 I ordered, more on that below)Negatives- There appears to be different versions of the same product. Of the 4 I bought, there are 3 different version of the web UI, and two different version of camera software (UPDATE: I have since learned that it is easy to update the software (both the camera and the UI) on the cams by following the instruction on Foscam's website). And 1 of the white cameras came with a much shorter power cord and the other 3 cameras all came with much longer cords. Weird. 1 of the 4 I bought appears to be an earlier hardware version of this model, but still the same model #. I bought them all through Amazon making sure Amazon Prime was listed as the seller.- 1 of the 4 cameras (the one that appears to be an older hardware version) keeps resetting itself. I plan to return that one and get another one.- I don't like the desktop monitoring software that came with very much so I think I will eventually buy a more sophisticated version. But actually the smartphone app works well enough for me, along with remote web browser viewing. I may just stick with those.Other Thoughts* The white ones are more glossy/shiny while the black ones are more matte/textured* The black ones seem to 'hide' better, while the white ones stick out more I think* I bought this version instead of the newer higher resolution version since the newer version seems to have a lot of really bad reviews. In hindsight, I think the video quality is good enough on this version so I'm happy with this oneThanks for reading.UPDATE (7/20/13): I switched to the LiveCams Pro paid iPhone app ($3.99 when I bought it) since it also works on the iPad. The previous app I was using (Surveillance Pro) was not iPad compatible. LiveCams Pro has some more features like it allows recording video and some other things that the previous app I was using did not support. I'm happy with LiveCams Pro and will be sticking with that for remote monitoring.

Once you get it installed and configured correctly, it works pretty well.  The video is very clear on my Windows 7 PC, MacBook Pro, iPad, my wife's iPhone 4S and my Galaxy Note 2.  The audio (one-way) is also very good.  You can remotely control the camera to pan left, right, up and down.  The night vision is not bad at all.There are three main concerns:(1) The manual and online website support will help you install it so that you can get it up and running on your desktop or laptop for inside your home network.  But, the installation for remote access (outside of your home wifi network) is very difficult!  The manual offers some guidance, but it's not easy if you are not computer savvy.In order to make it work outside of your home, you need to enable port forwarding.  Unless you are a computer geek, you will have to learn what this is, because there is no simple plug and click option.  I finally got it to work after a few hours, including calling Foscam's tech support.  To their credit, the support guy was helpful.(2) Even after you get the port forwarding set up correctly, it's not clear how you can use it on your iPhone/iPad/Android phones.  I have all three of them, but there is no mention in the manual which apps you need to download.  I was told by the Foscam tech rep that they don't have an official app, so he recommended certain 3rd party appps.  At any rate, I found the following apps that mostly works well: For Galaxy Note 2, there are\"Foscam IPC\" (which may or may not be an official Foscam app) and \"IP Cam Viwer Lite\" apps.  Both are free and work fine as long as you are just monitoring and listening in.  Don't bother paying for IP Cam Viewer Pro since it only adds 2-way voice (more on the 2-way voice problems below).  For iPad and iPhone, I have the \"Foscam IP Cam Viewer\" app, which is free and works well.  \"IP Cam Viewer Lite\" also has an iPad/iPhone app.  But all of them have issues with 2-way voice.Because all (or most) of these apps are 3rd party apps, Foscam does not provide support for them.  So, once you figure out how to set up the port forwarding, and you have also figured out which app to use, you now have to configure the apps correctly.  Again, there is no guidance by Foscam on this, so you'll have to figure it out yourself through trial and error.  For me, the easiest method was to set up the apps using the DDNS supplied by Foscam.  (I didn't know what DDNS was before this experience.)(3) The 2-way voice feature does NOT work well.  On the laptops (I have both a Windows and a MacBook Pro), as well as the IP Cam Viewer Pro and Foscam IP Cam Viewer apps (iPhone/iPad and Android apps), you have to toggle the 2-way voice on and off , otherwise, you'll get a lot of feedback.  The feedback noise is very loud and makes it very difficult to have a conversation at all.  In fact, the Foscam IPC app for Android crashes if you try to use the 2-way voice.  I think this is a known-problem, but Foscam has not been able to correct this in a satisfactory manner.  I now just use the one-way audio feature to listen in and avoid using the 2-way feature.Overall, this is a nice IP camera.  It works really well provided that you can get it set up on your mobile device and don't need the 2-way voice feature.

My biggest problem was I could not get the camera remotely accessed because I had my AirAve (a wireless product to boost cell phone signal strength inside the house) installed before the wireless router and that caused a firewall issue accessing the camera on the web as I could not get port forwarding to work. Putting the AirAve after the router resolved the issue!The customer Service was good based on the email exchanges I had with them. Their user interface for controlling your camera is not very user friendly but you can learn about how to get things to work out by watching videos on Youtube.Two main flaws I noticed, and the customer service confirmed those as well:1) The way audio really does not work.

Lo)\"", "ReviewID": "R2JLRBE4HAJ45C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are already many very detailed reviews, so let me just cut to the chase and try to address some myths/FAQs.Yes, this product is the real thing. It's not a fake. Buy it from Amazon and you'll be fine.No, it's not as easy or \"plug and play\" like a Fisher Price baby monitor. This remote-control camera has a built-in computer that is capable of motion detection and communicating with the world via its own web/email/FTP server! Now don't panic, you don't need to be a geek to figure it all out. You just need to read the instructions, or better yet, read any of the detailed reviews from fellow users that spell out exactly how to get it working. There are a few extra steps if you need to access the cam from outside your local network. Once you figure it out, you'll realize that the setup was not much worse than, say, adding an email account on a smartphone. (On the other hand, if you're the type who just turns your smartphone over to the help desk to do all the yucky technical setup stuff, then perhaps this cam isn't for you.)Yes, a small but vocal minority of people have claimed it doesn't work. I've read dozens of their reviews, and often you can actually see where they went wrong. For example, during the initial setup, they didn't read the directions and failed to plug the device into the router with the provided ethernet cable, and just tried to do it all wirelessly.Yes, the customer service is real. Seems like that small minority of people couldn't figure things out, and they were too cynical to believe anybody else could. So they claim that \"all\" the 5 star reviews (over 1000!) are faked by the company. If you take the time to read a lot of reviews (like I did),  you'll see plenty of Amazon-verified purchases like mine. Those complainers even scoffed when reviewers cited the real name of a helpful service rep. Well, those names are mentioned repeatedly in Amazon-verified purchaser reviews, so obviously they are real. Guess what, sounds like this is that rare company that actually employs really helpful people. Go figure!Yes, you can access the camera from multiple browsers/platforms, but *NO* they don't all work equally well. With IE on Windows, you have all the functionalities, but you're tied to a desktop computer. On Macs, Safari works so-so well with *no* audio and just lower video resolution (regardless of whether you choose high or low resolution).Yes, there is free dynamic DNS provided for 2 years via myfoscam.org. So for most people, there is no need to go set up a third party service, at least not right away. For some paranoid people who worry that evil hackers want to peek in on their babies/cats/whatever, RTFM to disable the service easily.Yes, the audio is very noisy. Two-way audio is even worse, as there is a 1-2 second lag, so it's a bit like international long distance calling from decades ago. To me this is not a deal breaker, as I turn on audio only now and then to get the gist of what's going on. If my kid is screaming, I am running up the stairs to take care of him in person, not trying to have a cogent 2-way conversation through the camera.No, the \"official\" smartphone app isn't even worth the free price. Yes, there are dozens of third party apps, just search for \"Foscam\" on your smartphone's app store. All the free apps get you the same decent video, but for audio you always have to pay a few bucks more. To me $5 or so is a very reasonable price for the amazing convenience of being able to monitor my home from my iPhone anywhere I go. (Seriously, when did we become so cheap?!? Before Amazon Prime, just the S&H; would have cost more than that.) Again, read the app reviews before you buy. I like CamViewer for IP Webcams and Foscam Surveillance Pro so far. Beware of similar-sounding app names. Foscam Pro used to be the old favorite with the most positive reviews, but it looks like they only released 2 versions in 2012 and nothing since, so the latest Foscam models and/or phones may not be compatible any more.I hope this helps others make up their minds. For me, this has been an amazing device. At $85 it has replaced our baby monitor that cost 3x as much. The video quality is way nicer. I can check in on my kid from the office or halfway across the world, right from my phone. We have 1 Foscam so far, and will likely be setting up several more around the house to watch not just the kid but also the cats, the finch nest on the front door, etc. :)", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor Video and No support unless you buy direct", "Author": "TommieT", "ReviewID": "R2D5TKUEOS2TUG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Foscam will not support their cameras under warranty unless you buy directly from them.

I tried mounting this camera inside a window but the glare was just too much and you could not see anything at night so I decided to try mounting it outside.  I read the faq's on foscams site and it mentioned you can mount it outside but under an overhang and preferably upside down (you can reverse the image in the settings to get the video to show right side up). I decided to give it a try and I have had this camera mounted outside under an overhang for a few months and it has been working great.The only problem with mounting it outside is the power plug will not reach and extending the power adapter will not work because DC voltage drops significantly even at just a few feet.  Initially I tried just extending the wire and the camera indicator lights would turn on but no video.  I tested the voltage and it was only 4 volts and the camera needs about 5 volts to run.  At that point you can either run really thick wire to combat DC voltage drop or you can run a higher voltage and regulate it at the camera. The solution for me was to get a voltage regulator and a 12 volt power adapter.Just in case anyone wants to try it here is a list of parts I used:From Amazon.comSeagate WA-18G12U AC power adapter -12V 1.5A ~120-240v USPremium 16/2 Awg 100 Feet CL2 Speaker Wire Cable - Oxygen Free CopperFrom another site (Do a search):DC Plug 3.5X1.35mm 90\u00b0 Right Angle Cord / Cable Navigation / Mobile Power Jack Note: You can also just cut off the jack from the original adapterAX3022 Based Switching Regulator Adapter Step-Down40mm Black Heat Shrink Tube Sleeving RoHSI cut the power adapter wire and connected it to the speaker wire and then ran the speaker wire to where I wanted the camera.  Make sure to be aware of polarity(positive and negative wire) and I would recommend soldering your connections.  Next, I connected the speaker wire to the voltage regulator and dialed it down to 5.2 volts(this was the voltage that was coming out of the original foscam adapter).  Next I connected the 3.5X1.35mm DC plug to the voltage regulator output and plugged it into the camera. After checking everything worked, I heat shrink wrapped the regulator and taped it onto the camera. You must have some knowledge of electrical work to complete this project and I would not recommend it if you have not done this type of work before.It has been working perfectly for the last 3 months with no problems and hopefully this helps someone looking to do the same thing.UPDATE 5/2/2014 - Everything is still working great after almost 2 years.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bad Power Supply :-(", "Author": "Just Joe", "ReviewID": "R22NB67PQRFQGD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "DOA :(  Wouldn't do anything until I tried replacing the power supply.

Dont expect support. Also people complain they are to hard to set up. This is true if you have no knowledge of routers, ip addresses, or port forwarding. Some people write these reviews using the correct terminology but they still dont have a clue what they are doing. I see them saying that the wifi doesnt work on them. Thats because they were to stupid to find the button in the gui to turn it on. One guy said you have to get a subscription to a dns service. You dont. he doesnt know what he is doing either. You could call your isp and get static ip's for less than 20 a month or just deal with it when your ip changes. If you have at&t; uverse it never does unless a tech changes equipment.

The FI8910W however, while billed as an improvement, does not live up to it's claims. The FI8910W adds an  Automatic IR-Cut Filter which filters out IR light from normal daytime pictures which greatly enhances the color quality over that of the FI8918W. When in almost total darkness, the IR-Cut Filter drops out, and you get the typical grey/green picture of the darkend room like all other IR cameras. The problem with the FI8910W is that the automatic IR-Cut Filter is so sensitive that with only a very small amount light in the room, either low light, or a small point source in an otherwise dark room, it IR-Cut Filter doesn't drop out. So even though the IR lights are illuminating the room, the IR-Cut Filter, filters all the IR light out, and the room appears the same as if the IR lights were not on.

Originally the FI8910W was launched with 802.11b/g and six months later new design and production has released the FI8910W with 802.11b/g/n. The manufacturer will not upgrade the camera to the latest model. But we can speak to the manufacturer if they'll except trade-ins of used models to offer a better price on new models.\"This makes no sense, it's the exact same model and price, yet some people get Wireless G and some Wireless N ridiculous.2. Their 2 year replacement policy is just a marketing scheme.3. Now to the Security part, do you know the password and username you transmit to login to the see camera are broadcast in plain text!!!

I bought this camera 2 weeks ago based on the reviews.  I was a little concerned because I am far from computer savvy.  Also, I have a 3 year old MacBook so I was worried about the Foscam/Apple interactions.  My router is a Netgear and I have Road Runner cable internet.  The directions are good, by not very thorough.  Don't get discouraged when you hit a stumbling block.  Just follow the directions again, and invite one of your computer literate buddies over for a couple of free beers.  Contrary to popular misconceptions you can run this on a secured network, and one other than WEP.  Again, follow the directions.  You will need to set the port forwarding correctly and get a domain from dyndns.com.  Apparently they use to be free.  They are no longer.... at least I couldn't find them free.  But, for $20 a year it is worth the price.  The default port for my router was 88, and for the camera 80.  That held me up for a couple days.  After I figured that out, it was smooth sailing.  Now I am able to view remotely.  Also I purchased Foscam Pro Surveillance from the Itunes store for 5 bucks.  That was a breeze to set up after I got the port correct and the password for the device, not the domain correctly entered into the ap.  All and all it was a small struggle for me to get everything dialed in.... but totally worth it.  The picture is very high quality considering the price, and the infrared works well.  I was not able to contact customer service by phone.  They transfer you around and then hang up on you.  They do reference you to blogs which I found to be not so useful.  It was more bitching than assistance.  So the camera gets 5 stars from me, and I will probably buy at least one more.  I hope that helps.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Product!

I noticed no picture quality difference so I returned the contrast setting to 4 after the reboot.I am finding this 640 x 480 quality camera perfect for basic surveillance and security.  It has an excellent mounting bracket and utility/control program.  I mounted it on the ceiling upside down.  The daylight picture quality is adequate and the nighttime infared (doesn't work through windows) is surprisingly good IMHO for such a relatively cheap camera that has two way audio.  The 270 degree rotation plus the up and down range provides an ample range of view.  I was able to figure out how to setup remote viewing by using the port forwarding instructions provided on the website.  The wait for tech support was surprisingly short.  I actually was able to speak to a live person from some offshore help desk.  My questions were pretty basic but I was able to get everything setup and running with a matter of a couple of hours.  I had to hop in my car and drive to an internet caf\u00e9 to confirm the remote viewing.  I couldn't confirm remote access in my house.  Doh!  I followed the security advice and purchased a DDNS provider for $19.95 per year to get a unique web address (no need to make things easy for hackers that flock to the free Foscam DDNS site).  The basic utility that allows you to setup users with ADMIN, OPERATOR, or VISITOR levels of access along with their passwords is pretty straight forward.  All this for about $70 plus the $19.95/yr for a unique DDNS.  In short, I am pleasantly surprised how easy it is to do this for such little money.Additional note on the Freezing Issue:  The Contrast is set to 4 and it works fine (backyard/garden/trees view).  I experienced the freezing and reboot when I set the contrast to 6.  It gave some warning signs when part of the picture started to freeze.  I set the contrast back down to 4 when it rebooted itself.  Given that I saw no discernible difference between a contrast of 4 and 6 (looking through a window to the outside) I am not concerned.  The indoor picture quality is acceptable.  Given the slow internet in my area and my desire to add additional cameras, I am happy with the 640 x 480 quality.

My Android phone uses a paid Foscam App and IPCam (for free) which works much better in terms of control layout.  But you don't need to pay $2.99 for an App.  The benefits are marginal.Set up was pretty easy.  For those that have had trouble probably didn't read the instructions.  The only tough part was setting up the Verizon Fios port forwarding.  It took at least 5 minutes to do a Google search to figure it out.I have dynamic DDNS service, but used the IP address and the 4 digit port I set up.  It's been a week and the public IP address hasn't changed.  I was starting to use the public IP forwarding service, but figured that for the infrequent times that my dynamic IP changes (I got it a month ago, and hasn't changed yet), that when it does change, I'll just cross the bridge when I come to it and change the IP address when I log in.You can turn on the IR light remotely.  You can control the camera direction by clicking on a control and on touch pads, swipe with your finger.  There are 8 preset positions which are great, and you can set it to automatically sweep vertically or horizontally.A great feature is a motion sensor that when triggered, will send by e-mail 6 pics from the camera.  I use it with my security system.There is a feature that periodically allows video to upload to an FTP service, but Verizon doesn't allow FTP hosting so I haven't been able to get it to work.  But, from your app or webpage create snapshots and videos.Finally, the apps allow you to view several cameras at the same time.  I haven't tried it because I only have one cam, but since several apps have it and you can view one window which the other(s) with no signal, I assume it should work.In summary, it has great features and it seems to work well.  If you want an inexpensive camera that can work wirelessly and over the internet that has a host of practical features, this is it.  If you want a professional grade camera, this is not for you.

Barr", "ReviewID": "RD3UHXB3F861H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the FI8910W camera, and was very excited after I installed it. It worked very smoothly using a local Web browser on my laptop, and it worked very well using one of several Android apps remotely from my smartphone.Unfortunately, it suffered from a known issue described elsewhere in these reviews: When the camera was pointed a a very bright scene, it would reboot causing it to go offline for a while, and then go through its initial \"pan around everywhere\" routine until it would finally settle at the first preset. I had it pointing at some dog crates near a bright window, so it would just continually reboot and reboot rendering it useless.I contacted Foscam Support, and they quickly diagnosed the issue. The fix was to get a replacement camera. I was still within the Amazon return period, so I could return it for an exchange, otherwise I could get an RMA from Foscam directly and have them replace it. Given the number of occurrences of this issue here on Amazon, I had no guarantee that a replacement from Amazon would not have the same issue, so I opted for the RMA directly from Foscam since they assured me that the replacement would work properly.I sent it back, and in about a week, I received a replacement. I installed it, and it now works reliably pointing to the same bright scene that caused the other camera to fail.I'm giving it only 4 stars because the camera did have a known issue, and I did have to pay extra shipping to send it back for the RMA. But other than that, I have to give this camera very high marks.

However, if you are using this as a wireless IP camera that has a good picture and sound, it is definitely worth going through the port-forwarding setup. I don't consider myself tech savvy, but as intimidating as getting online and wireless sounds, it's not difficult. You will need to do your research (like being able to access the software inside your router, which can be found using Google-Fu), and follow the manual. Have patience, and it shouldn't take more than 20-30 minutes, even at a slow pace.One thing that you need to remember once you set the camera up is that you'll have two ways to access it. From your home network, you'll use your local IP address, and while you're out, you need to use your internet IP address.There are a lot of ways to get frustrated, but relax, and you'll get through it.Once it's hooked up, the camera itself is very clear and has a microphone built-in, so you can listen while monitoring. It also has inputs and outputs for a microphone and speakers, so you can also talk through the camera to people that are in the room. I use IP Cam Viewer Lite, and I can listen and talk through my iPhone. I hooked up a small speaker to the camera so I can \"speak\" to it. Sometimes the audio may cut in and out, but that depends mostly on your connection to the internet from your viewing device.I haven't used the email alerts for motion-detection, so I can't comment on that.

Great for home security, etc. Baby viewing. Many uses. Be aware that if you intend to view these IP Cams remotely (iPhone, smart phone, remote internet connection) that you do need to know how to port forward from your WiFi router. Not a huge big deal & can be done easily, but with security of the connection in mind - MAKE SURE you do it right. Instructions are in broken english so they can be challenging. However if you, or a friend, has some knowledge of your WiFi internal settings, you can do it. There are a few good YouTube vid's on setting these up. They are better than the instructions. Also good tips on the FOSCAM site. You you've never tried them, you HAVE to get a few of these IP Cams. So much fun viewing what is going on an a few rooms of your home when you are away.However I'm not sure the HD cam's are worth the extra cost or bandwidth/response time remotely. I also bought the higher priced FI9821W V2 2-pack and they work well. I'm not sure they work ENOUGH better to make the trip, but they are HD and that seems like a must have right?This low def version has acceptable quality and IR operates about the same as HD models. Not quite as wide angle as the HD cams. In anything but perfect light the HD cams don't really come into their own. Often where you choose to place the cam, you have less than perfect light.I'm glad I have the 2-pack, but don't automatically shy away from these lower def ones. They are pretty capable. Software available is good. Tried them all. Steer clear of the FOSCAM smart phone app. You may find it in the App Store, but I don't think even FOSCAM recommends it. It doesn't operate all the controls of the newer IP cams, and somewhat limited on the older ones too. I ended up with LiveCam Pro and find it just what I was looking for in an iPhone app.I've only had them a few weeks, so I don't know if they will hold up. We'll see.

On troubleshooting, I discovered that the camera was no longer on my WiFi network.Figuring that maybe it was too far from the router (although it was only about 20' away, max), I repositioned the camera just on the other side of a wall from the router. The total distance was less than 5', with only one thickness of wall between them. Even at this distance, the camera dropped off the network again after 3 hours.

It isn't 100% plug and play for viewing while you are outside of your wireless network, but it is definitely doable so read more below.Why I bought it: I bought this camera as a supplement to my home alarm system. Essentially, if I get a call from the alarm company, I'd like the ability to pull up my cameras and see if anything looks out of place or God forbid, someone is in the home. I am currently using it to check in on a dog we are fostering for a local rescue! I have also used to to check our basement for any leaks/signs of water during very cold temperatures. The possibilities are endless. I am receiving another one from Amazon today.The good: $65-ish camera that has pretty good image quality, night vision, and can be viewed from almost anywhere. Free (or cheap) apps allow you to check in on your home or child with relative ease. The mount that comes with it is not bad at all and no other components are required for a basic installation.The not-as-good: I'm a fairly tech-savvy guy, but my weakness is network settings, router configuration and port forwarding. That is required to set up this camera for viewing it from outside your wireless network. Now, do not let that discourage you, because there are some great youtube videos by Foscam themselves and a guy that goes by AwkwardHamster on how to do this. Also, buying from Amazon you have tech support from Foscam if you need it.Overall, great camera so far. I've had it since Christmas and use it multiple times per day.

Obviously, you have to have a dedicated computer, tablet, or phone, to run an application that will capture video, as this product doesn't have a hard, drive. Dvr, or sd card. People that have written bad reviews probably didn't know that this is like a tv with no TiVo, u can watch all you want, but the camera needs something to store the data. They do offer a newer model with sd, but for the price, might as well use an old laptop with an upgraded hard drive. Discard the disc, download the latest software from foscam.us, keeping in mind that this only modifies the network, and so on data on the camera itself, and they offer a very basic web app that allows you to view and control some features.

One of the cameras did not come with any instructions or the software CD - bad customer service on the part of Warehouse Deals, Inc?Last night we tried to set up the camera using the iPhone app. That did not work so we plugged the cameras into the router and tried to connect that way. We both have new mac laptops so we no longer have a CD Drive in our house so we could not run the software from the CD included in the camera boxes. I tried downloaded the IP Camera software from the FOSCAM site and it was able to pick up the \"Anonymous\" camera on the network and take me to the IP page to start ActiveX. Once I clicked on ActiveX, though, I could never get the \"Device Management\" portion to work (I would click on it and nothing would happen; \"Javascript:administrator()\" would appear in the lower left of the browser window. I used Chrome, Firefox, and Safari and had the same results for all three. Cookies are enabled in all of the browsers. Internet Explorer is no longer supported by Apple so that is not an option for us.After these tries, we went back to the iPhone app. The app would sporadically 'find' the camera but settings could never be updated. It would drop the camera then find it again. And we would get an error notification that the user name and password were not correct OR we exceeded the number of devices on our network. We checked the devices on our network and that was not the problem.We gave up in frustration at 1am last night having made NO progress or having any luck at all in making the cameras work. The cameras would cycle through its motions but we never got a picture from it in any way.This morning we discovered through the iPhone app that each camera has an odd user name that we did not set up. Now we are curious if this means that our refurbished items were never restored to factory default and we don't have the old user name/password so we can't login because of that...?For the price and capabilities, we want to keep these cameras and get them set up...I just need some help from the interwebs to step me through the process like I've never touched a computer before.Thanks!", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Relatively easy setup and works well in cold temperatures outside", "Author": "Sammy G \"Sammy G\"", "ReviewID": "R2M0G1Q48SS9A8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like many other users, I've installed this outside under a large awning.

Camera is really good!", "Author": "Peter", "ReviewID": "RE0KOS33LCE2A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK. This IPCam can be a little frustrating initially, but once set up it is absolutely worth it. I read a lot of articles on Foscam's website, watched their videos, etc. but still had trouble accessing the camera away from home. I have a 3wire DSL router, an Airport Extreme, and the camera is installed by my front door and connected wirelessly. I finally decided to call Foscam, they remotely connected to my computer and fixed everything, and now it works great from anywhere in the world. Right now, I am accessing it remotely from several iPhone apps: Surveilance, uFoscam, and CamViewer. It works great in all three though I prefer Surveilance. You can tilt and pan the camera remotely on your iPhone (or even through web browser). I got a free IP address through No-ip.com. It works great outside mounted in overhand (NOT directly in rain/snow).So, some of you may be wondering: why bother with all this technical setup and trouble when you could just buy a different camera, like a D-Link? First of all, the D-links I saw at the same price lacked features (didn't have good night vision and/or didn't pan/tilt). Second, and most importantly, this camera doesn't rely upon a 3rd party website (e.g. Dlink's own site) to view your camera remotely. You directly access your camera! If you are concerned with privacy and security and no middle-man, then I really think this is the way to go. As long as you have a wired/wireless connection at home, you will always have access to your camera.So far, I've had it 1 week and it emails me when someone drops a package at my door. Then, I can SMS my neighbor and ask them to pick it up for me. I can pan the camera and see the front yard and check things out as well. Night vision works great as well.

I liked the idea that it has 2-way audio available, could be remotely aimed and being wireless might be an easy install.Setup was fairly easy and I found it worked on Windows, Android, and Apple products with suitable apps.  The integrated IR LEDs are bright enough to illuminate maybe 50-75' out from the camera when its dark.I pretty quickly decided that this should probably not be used outdoors unless extremely well protected from the elements so I ordered a Foscam dome enclosure for it.  One of the first problems I encountered when going into the dome with this is the IR LEDS light up the inside of the dome and wash out the field of view completely when they are on.  So I put black electrical tape over them, not wanting to do any mods like disabling them that might void the warranty.  I then needed an external IR illuminator and assumed that because I can see a small amount of visible red from the installed LEDs they were probably 850nm.  However I didnt want to buy anything until I could conform that 850 was the right choice and ther seemed to be some disagreement on forums about what was best.  So I bought a small sample of clear encased T 1/3/4 \"100ma\" 850nm, 890nm and 950nm IR LEDS, all rated at about the same luminosity on axis at 100ma and with roughly the same directional characteristics.  I set up a test board with one of each mounted and biased each to operate at the same luminous output as the others based on the published current versus luminosity.  I was easily able to see thru the camera that the 850nm was the best choice as it produced about twice the brightness of the 890 and that twice the 950 with this camera when it was in \"IR On\" mode. It was dark otherwise.  Side note - the 850 LED does produce a slight visible red glow where the 890 and 950 do not.  This is not a mystery, its just a characteristic of LEDs. They produce a primary wavelength light and bell shaped sidebands of longer and shorter and longer wavelength light.  It happens the only output we can actually see from any of these is the red which is on the shorter wavelength sideband of the 850 LED.  I bought an inexpensive 850nm illuminator to mount outside the dome and that works great.Now to my main criticism and the main reason I decided to not install this for my mother to use at her house.  The wireless connection (802.11 G)  is just too slow making the operation of the camera pan and tilt very hit and miss.  Sometimes its immediate and sometimes its....never.  And it is usually somewhere in between.  Maybe 802.11  would be fact enough.  A wired LAN connection is much better, but whats the point in the extra costs of the built-in wifi if you have to wire it up. Anyway I just couldnt see my mother bothering to deal with that.Another weak spot is the sound from the internal speaker or an external speaker/amp plugged in to the camera.  I would guess that a lot gets dropped somewhere between the mic on the smartphone/tablet/desktop (I tried all and, with Android 4.2, Win8, and IOS) and the speaker (its likely at the camera) because it is mostly not understandable.  The other way - mic on the camera to all the above is much better, at least its intelligible.So, I am hanging onto this unit and mounted at my front door in the dome. As it happens getting AC power there is easy but running a LAN cable nearly impossible.  My mother in going to get a fixed mount, no sound POE wired camera - at her house running a LAN is easy, getting AC power to it not so easy.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product", "Author": "Bret", "ReviewID": "R3PNNATGIXIS7U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My FI8910W is amazing.

My inner geek took over and I figured there must be other solutions out there that would meet my requirements and beyond. Compared to an equivalent Motorola or other brand video monitor this comes in about 2-3 times cheaper depending on fluctuating sale prices. Granted, the dedicated models usually come with no fuss set up and a dedicated viewer monitor. But with some elbow grease, this will do that and more like remote viewing via iphone/Android apps or any PC that's connected to the internet. It also has pan and tilt so you could effectively see 270 degrees horizontally around the camera. The camera tilts upwards too but has a limited angle downwards; probably because its own base would impede visibility. I've mounted two of them upside down to alleviate as the apps and pc settings allow you to invert the image as needed. I also liked the idea that these would see a repurposed life as security cams after the initial baby years.Video QualityMax supported res is 640*480 and on my wireless N network I seem to get 10-15 fps at best. I'd consider this good enough to monitor the overall situation but you won't be seeing razor sharp detail nor fast movement; it's enough resolution and frame rate to smoothly capture someone walking across view. Night vision is excellent and I have no issues seeing over 10 feet in each room in total darkness. In other words, I can see clearly if baby is stirring, awake, and of course actively looking for us.Audio QualityThese camera's offer 2 way audio and in practical terms that means it transmits audio from the room it's in and also plays back audio out of a speaker. Yes, it's like an intercom. The catch of course is that in order to talk through the camera, your pc must have a mic built in like many modern laptops already do or your Apple/Android device has to have a mic input too of course. There are mic and speaker input/outputs on the back but I've found that I don't need them as the mic sensitivity and speaker volume are fine for both our living room and nurseries.SetupSo decent video and audio, but what is it like to setup? The Foscam.us site has improved A LOT and now they have youtube tutorials to guide you through as much or as little setup as is needed for your use. I only went through initial camera setup, wifi network setup, but left motion alarms, FTP uploads, and other advanced features alone. I just wanted to be able to watch what's going on remotely. The first camera took close to 2 hours to set up as I clumsily jumped between googled guides I found, Foscam's website, and my own Wireless Router's port forwarding settings. The 2nd and 3rd camera's were set up as quickly as 20 min once I became familiar with the process steps needed for my use. The website or cd provides a utility to identify the camera's ip address so you can navigate to the camera's web interface via a webbrowser and configure from there. That's all you need if you just want to view video within your wifi network. Remote access will require you dig into your router to set up port forwarding, and a web host like no-ip.org becomes a desired feature so you can just type in a web address instead of your public ip address when remote. There are instructions how to do these things and none of them are hard it just takes time to follow along.InstallCamera comes with power cord, plastic wall mount, lan cable, and external antenna. The mount is serviceable and with the proper screws you can mount easily on drywall. Note that the camera unit is pretty big and not easy to hide or blend in decor. it's the size of the chunkiest early generation webcam you can imagine. The one advantage of dedicated units is that you could take them with you to other people's homes and since they are locked to a particular viewing monitor you'd be set up in minutes. These camera's rely on broadcasting their signal via wifi so unless you're up for redoing setup while travelling it's probably best to consider these as permanent installations at home.AppsI view my camera's on both IOS and Android platforms. On android I use tinyCam Monitor PRO, to me it has the best layout on Android and is worth the $5 I spent on it. On Iphone, I use Foscam Pro which had the best mix of layout and functionality up until the latest update. Their app team is still trying to squash bugs but it's already on its way to become the top Foscam viewer app again. With these apps, I can remotely view and take video's and/or pictures that are saved to my mobile device.Alternatives?If all this setup sounds daunting to you, I would suggest looking into Dropcam product offerings.

I can't tell if it's a manufacturing defect or a design flaw (ie. not sure if exchange will help) but they seem to have trouble staying online when running over WiFi. After a few days it seems like the camera will just disappear from the WiFi network. I'm running them with static IPs out of the range of the number of devices on my network. It works great for a random number of days and then it no longer responds over the network - can't ping it, and the router shows the device as disconnected. Then, I have to reboot the camera to get it back online.It seems to be related to when there are connection problems because it seems to be more stable if it's closer to the wireless router. But, it's not a very good IP security camera if it can't handle a connection interruption and I have to physically power cycle it to get it working again.

The big pain in the process is port forwarding--I wouldn't even bother trying--just call them and they will remote in to your computer, change some router settings and then a pin hole will be created to allow your camera to be viewed by any device and any computer in the world.

Note: they will encourage you to buy the Foscam App for iPhone ($5.99) while on the support line and will help you configure it--while I didn't really want to spend the $5.99, I rationalized I had a tech support guy set me up for free--glad I did it.

I bought the first two when they cam up for sale on Woot a while back and added the 2-pack from Amazon a couple of weeks ago. I use them for home security and as \"Kitten cams\" for the wife when she is away on business and suffering feline separation anxiety.Prior to getting the Foscams I was using a couple of Astek Moles. Comparing these the Foscams have a slightly wider field of view and their IR \"night vision\" is head and shoulders above the Moles.These are indoor cameras and can not be used safely outdoors but I do have 2 mounted on windows viewing well lit areas outside the home and they work well under these conditions.The CONS:The built-in web interface sucks! The design is actually quite nice but the implementation leaves a great deal to be desired. The thing will give you various errors when attempting to make simple changes to the config, often requiring a reset and reconfig and some playing with the sequencing of the set up, the browser you use or, how you access the device's web page (Directly through your LAN, via the WAN through the forwarded port or putting the thing in the DMZ and hitting it directly. And despite repeated tries and a couple of calls to tech support. I have yet to be able to get the multi-camera view working utilizing the built-in interface.Foscam's tech support is hit or miss at best. And their standard answer seems to be reset the device and if that doesn't work, send it back.Having said that, once you get past the above issues and adjust for the camera's foibles, they work well once configured.After testing a number of remote apps on my various android devices, I wound up going with Blue Iris on my desktop and it's associated Android app. It was well worth the $10.

The cam seems to reboot and goes to its park position.

On a wireless network, problematic, to be generous.I have other Foscam models as well as clones. None have given me the grief that this one has.First, one cannot simply add in one's SSID and shared secret, in spite of those standard options. No, you have to scan, then select the network, then the shared secret previously entered works.Wireless performance is horrible. Figure ping times between 400ms to 1900ms and loads of dropped packets, regardless of range to the access point. Mine came with the high gain antenna, so I then tried that.Performance was barely acceptable then, but no other wireless device in the house could then compete with the excessive signal strength.If I put this outside, I'll have to run a cat5 line to it, otherwise, it'll never work for me.I'm putting it in the dining room and I'll run a cat5 line to it.I'm just shocked that Foscam is selling such a lousy performing camera! Their other cameras are quite good.Optical performance is good. Pan/tilt work well when wired, uncontrollable when wireless.IR performance is excellent.Wireless has enough power, as with the high gain antenna, it drowned out my network. So, I have to wonder what is wrong with the receiver. This isn't new technology, this kind of issue should never occur today.Update: Took the unit outside, distance to wireless access point was around 20 feet. Connects to the access point, but barely and can't handle any IP traffic at all, even with the high gain antenna.I opened a ticket with Foscam.

The picture is good and the control work good as well. You have to pay for the full app for you phone. I think that sucks. The problems started when I tried to set up the remote access through the web. You have to subscribe to a web host for a minimal charge in order to be able to view your camera remotely from the web. The instructions are very vague and the quality of the instruction video that is on the install CD is really poor. It looks like they took the picture with a toaster. You would think a camera company would have a pristine video. Well it has been two weeks and I have played with it a few time, but still no luck. I have two weeks to get this set up as I wanted it to check on my house when I go on a extended vacation. I just don't get why they have to make things so difficult. I am no dummy when it comes to computers and networking. If I do ever figure this thing out, I will probably buy one or two more to spread out in my house.Update 11/9/13: I called Foscam and they remoted on to my computer and set up the web browsing for me. Turns out that I had done everything right, it is just that you need to use a different network connection to view your camera over the web than the one the camera is on. They should state this loud and clear somewhere. Also, you do not need to sign up to a web host to get access. Foscam gives you a free connection. The remote app works great over WiFi or a wired connection, but is very sluggish and slow over a cell connection. I used this while we went on vacation for two weeks. You can set up alarms so when the camera detects sound or motion it will email you 6 pictures. Got worried one AM when it showed people in my house. Turns out it was the cleaning lady who got the dates mixed up. I was not able to figure out who was in the picture by sight, but when I put two and two together and figured out that was her normal day, I could see it was her. So, the picture could be better.

I've had these cameras for a while to watch my pets when I'm away and I've even got some for friends.  They do the job well and you don't need to be an expert to get it to work.  I've updated the firmware once and unfortunately it required me to manually input the IP address instead of using DHCP but no big deal.Now for the reason for my low rating:  Business practices and customer service should figure into ratings so customers are aware of the total package.  I can't speak for customer service since I've never had to use it but...There are many review that cover this product itself, so I'll leave that alone.  The biggest problem for this device for me comes with their email communications.  Having the latest firmware updates and patches for an IP camera for me is as important as operating system patches.  If you don't want someone taking advantage of a security flaw and viewing your cams, you should update them.  Therefore, I've signed up for Foscam's firmware updates email list.Unfortunately, they take advantage of you and I receive at least one sales pitch or promotional email from them every day.  I specifically did NOT sign up for that list.  The list I signed up for was the firmware updates.  It is NOT COOL to take advantage of your customers by spamming them while holding the carrot of security firmware updates over their heads.

One thing that can be annoying is that it is sensitive to changes in lighting, which it uses for detection of motion.  I am using it in a garage, and the changes in contrast between inside the garage and the daylight that comes either through the open door or windows when the door is closed cause it to give a lot of false alarms.  I have it set to send me pictures by email when it detects motion, so I am constantly deleting emails from things like a passing cloud changing the brightness.  It does have adjustments to set the sensitivity, but this hasn't worked out yet.One other thing that I am puzzled about is that it doesn't always record the video when it detects the motion.  I get the pictures, but don't always get video at the same time.The port forwarding would have been a lot quicker and easier to set up if I could have had an explanation of some of the terms involved.  I gave my camera its own unique port number.  I then set up my router - it has an option for setting up port forwarding.  I then used one of the dynamic ip address web sites (I used no-ip.com).  Once I had my web address for my router, all I had to do was to figure out that the camera's port number has to be used at the end of the address, e.g., mycamera.no-ip.biz:1234.Other than a lot of extra emails, it is way cool to be able to monitor what is going on at any time from any location.", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for the Money", "Author": "VonFang", "ReviewID": "R305RNQXL8ZPB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently purchased one of these cameras for my brother because he had his bike stolen off of his porch.

Once you set them up and can see what you need to see, you will find they become a part of your life like the doors or windows. If they turn off for some reason you will feel anxious and want to immediately restore them to functional condition.I have a battery of these cameras covering the house. The monitor seriously feels like one of the windows. But instead of having to go to the window, move the curtains, and then look out, I just glance at the monitor. It is impossible to describe how life changing it is to be able to see what is going on outside of the house without having to look out a window or go outside.The neighbor's cats are always crawling around outside. If I hear a noise I can just look at the monitor to see if it is them or a person instead of having to go outside. Racoons are also always making a racket I always had to check on. Now I sit and watch them on the monitor while they snoop around.The cameras are a fantastic help with the delivery guys. Since I put one up on the doorway all of my packages are laid very carefully on the steps instead of being hurled up there like they used to be. The delivery guys are always polite and smiling when they see the camera looking at them. I even ended up putting a monitor in every room to watch them. If I am cooking I can see who is at the door or out front. If I am in bed I can see what is going on. If I am in the dining room or living room I don't have to move a muscle to see who is knocking.I would not install them in the interior of a house though.

I used to use a wired system that hooked to my computer with a card, but I always had trouble with a wavy image that made it difficult to get good responses from the motion detector.  I either got no hits, or it triggered regularly because of detecting the wavy image as motion.  This camera does not have that issue.After setting the camera up in my Blue Iris software, I set it where i used to have one of the old cameras, and it has a solid image, a definite improvement.  The furthest location tested so far is in my basement, about 30 feet from my router on the first floor.I tinkered with connecting to it via the internet, and it worked, but if I decide to use internet connectivity in the future, I will do it through the Blue Iris software to allow for viewing videos triggered by detecting motion, and viewing multiple cameras at once.The motion when scanning a room is smooth, and allows for significant coverage.  The infrared night vision works well, and during he day the color seems clear.I was tempted to go with the HD version, but I am glad I got what I did, since it gives me enough detail without the extra space required for storing HD video.

I have used different browsers with no luck.  That's not much of a problem, though, as I use my iPad to monitor the live video, and the app I use has perfect two-way audio.  That brings me to my only other complaint...the lack of an iOS and/or Android app provided by Foscam.  When I purchased this cameral, I assumed the manufacturer would have their own app and that it would be free to use.  I assumed wrong.  You have to use third-party apps, some of which are free.  However, the free ones, as you would expect, have very few features.  Most, if not all, do not allow two-way audio.

I double clicked on the IP address, a web page popped up to allow me to proceed to the next step of \"wireless set up\". This is where I got lost. I couldn't set my camera up via wireless no matter which way I tried. Finally, I phoned Foscam toll free number listed in the instruction booklet. This was a Sunday afternoon Pacific standard time when I called Foscam for support. I selected technical support.  And in a few minutes, it connected me to a man on the other line. The man remote connected into my computer, then copy/paste my WPS wireless password, and got me to connected to remote IP address. He did it in the matter of a few minutes. He was professional, polite, efficient and clear in his communication. He disconnected. And I was able to see my camera view via wireless mode.Afterwards, I downloaded the Foscam APP on my iPhone, which isn't free. Costs $5.99. Now I can see my pets in action on my iPhone.I'm not a computer techie nor into networking.The wire set up was easy for me. The wireless set up was challenging. Compare this camera to my dLink camera, I found the dLink camera has an easier wireless set up than Foscam.  However, Foscam camera has a better quality of resolution and functionality of the pan/tilt/rotate and sound. My dLink camera is stationary and doesn't pan/tilt/rotate.I bought this for keeping an eye on my pets as well as for security.Thank Goodness to Foscam excellent and fast customer support to help me set up this camera on a weekend day! Otherwise, I wouldn't have kept it. My week days are too hectic to have time to set up anything else. The fact that Foscam tech support was able to help me in a matter of a few minutes on a weekend day.  It was a big plus for me.  I would give it 5 stars if the wireless set up instruction was clearer, or for \"tech dummies like me\", in the enclosed instruction booklet.I'm happy with the fact that I can keep an eye on my precious pets, who sleep most of the day and ruin my furniture. :)(Also, thumbs up for Amazon's customer support service in sending me the replacement camera.)", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Customer support", "Author": "Valerie", "ReviewID": "RIQGIUAHO8KC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Calvin is incredible.

The alarm system is setup to call my cell phone whenever there is an activation. I then use the Foscam Viewer Lite app on my Android phone to connect to the camera and determine what activated the alarm. Worked well during our recent vacation, even though we had no alarms, I still checked in on the house every so often. Gave me some peace of mind.The setup instructions may be a bit too much for some people. I worked for many years in the computer & networking field, so even though the instructions were a bit confused I had the camera setup on my network in about 20 minutes. I use a static IP for the camera inside my LAN. I suggest you first configure it with a dynamic LAN IP and test it out, then use the static IP if necessary. I used the static IP as it was easier to configure my broadband router to do port forwarding with an IP rather than a MAC address. Your configuration may be different. The port forwarding option combined with a dynamic DNS service such as DynDNS or No-IP will let you connect to a public server within your LAN from the internet. In this case the public server is the HTTP (web) server built into the Foscam FI8910W. Once you get this setup you do not need your computer on; just have the cable/DSL modem and router powered and the camera of course.A couple of tips: remember to change the default user name and password in the device; second - don't connect to the camera as administrator from outside your LAN. I setup a viewer account and an operator account. The viewer can only see what the camera is pointing at (they can't move it), the operator can move the camera, but can't change the settings. The admin can do anything.Anyway worked good for me and my use, though a bit over complex to setup & configure for internet access (but the good thing is that it can be adapted to just about any network configuration or use). I only had one problem with connecting to it during vacation and that was after exiting the phone app without using the exit button in the app. This seemed to hang the camera, but a few hours later I tried it again and it was working. I was using the myfoscam.org dynamic DNS service they might have had an issue as I could not connect to the camera from a laptop either until some time passed.", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "I do not usually write reviews but................", "Author": "J. Zand", "ReviewID": "R30AEDK0TM0WX2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little product is just amazing.  Almost as fantastic as the tech support the company provided to set it up.  I do not usually write reviews, but every once in a while I come across a product or service where I feel motivated to share a great experience.  So in many ways I am not sure where to begin.  Part of my happiness is that technology has arrived to the point where one can have a remote controlled camera, day and night with sound and bells and whistles that one could only have imagined years ago.  I originally bought this camera so that if the alarm at work ever went off that I could see what was going on before remotely disabling the alarm.Let's face it technology is great these days.  But here is where Foscam really shined.  I called tech support and ended up speaking to India and what a great experience.  First the Tech Support line tells you what number you are in line and how long the wait is.  Right from the start you never feel like you are blowing in the wind.  They are available from 7am-9pm 7 days a week.  I ended up talking with this gentleman whose name was Derrick.  I am not sure I ever had better tech support in my life.  He logged onto my computer remotely,  set up the whole system, told me what program was best for my iPhone to integrate with the camera, and then had me open up a blank note pad and typed out every setting for me to enter into the iPhone application.  Finally he typed his email address, extension number, and hours he works in case I had any more questions.  All I can say is WOW!  Yes the Foscam is cute.  Yes it has some very very cool features.  But the customer service was absolutely outstanding.Oh a couple more things.  To get the free tech support, you have to purchase from the Foscam store or an authorized dealer.  So get ready to pay $15-20 more.  Foscam has a store on Amazon, and I also believe Ebay, as well as direct.  Also, if you want to use this as a baby monitor, it has some very cool features, like notifying you of sound or movement all with adjustable sensitivities.  The whole thing is great, and I couldn't be happier.Thanks Foscam and Derrick!

Makes me wonder how much of it is a case of user error, rather than hardware issues.  The Web GUI is moderate at best, but once you can work through the kinks and get everything set up, its not that bad.  Too be honest, i've seen a lot worse.  I saw a few reviews saying to avoid using the installation cd that came with the camera but it has some nice features which let you change camera settings without the need for the GUI.  making some setting changes a breeze.  Also, the Foscam Pro app is a MUST HAVE, well worth the 5.99 as it takes the camera's to a whole new level in terms of stability, functionality.The multi-cam set up was a bit flaky in terms of loading all the cameras on to 1 screen but again, most of the issues were because of the web GUI.  The two way audio is nothing crazy but it wasnt high on her priority list.  The pan/tilt feature works great, and has adjustable speed for the rate of motion.  The motion sensor works as described and I've set her up with a second hard drive to store all the recordings.  If you've never set up port forwarding and changed settings on your router, it may be difficult at first.  Seeing as i have done this numerous times, everything worked like a charm.  I recommend use DHCP, but once your router assigns the camera(s) an IP address, make it static so it is linked with that mac address.  so no matter what happens to the camera, when it reconnects, no other device will take its IP address.  Wireless signal seemed fine, but she has a small place with a very open floor plan so i never had any concerns on that being an issue.  The quality was as expected since its only 640x480, having a 720p resolution would have been nice but since the main purpose of the cameras are to be a \"nanny cam\", its fine.  For those who download the app, one feature which is great, is you can zoom in on the image at the time, and if you choose snap-shot or record it will keep the recording/image on your phone.  So hypothetically if you witness a robbery in progress through your cameras, they can steal your computer but you still have the recording handy on your phone/tablet.I liked the cameras so much that I am actually looking to ditch the cameras that came with my home security system and put these in instead!", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "f18910w", "Author": "Thomas M.", "ReviewID": "R3TCIHEXTYSAHV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This a great product, work as is described in the web site.I highly recommend this product, very clear imaging.for recording I have to leave my computer on that's the drawback.", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Foscam Technical Support", "Author": "Desmond", "ReviewID": "R3QK4B2NK4C0PE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received the camera today and right away contacted Foscam Technical Support for help with setting it up.

Luckily my tech skills are almost top notch and I can manage but for others who aren't, might be a pain in the neck. DDNS needs to be simpler allowing people to just set it all up through a Foscam app perhaps or through their site.

This was my dream come true.  Plus it's remote viewing AND you can control the position of the camera. I LOVE IT!I've only had it for a couple weeks but it's been great. Let me preface that I haven't tried to use it past my cable modem, i.e. outside my local router. That's a cool feature as well, but not what I need.I pulled it out of the box, connected it to my router, installed software and BAM! I had access to the camera.  Then I configured for wireless and put the camera in the front window and had remote control. It was very easy. If you can set up a router, you can set up this camera (at least for local viewing).I've been recording my property for the past two weeks and I love it. How nice not to have to use a VCR to review video.I have a question however, is there a way to schedule recording aside from motion detection or alarms?  This is my only issue to date. I'd like to be able to record while I'm away and schedule it. I can always use some macro that clicks on record, then clicks off record and schedule that on my computer.There were a few issues setting it up, namely it didn't initially say what the admin password was in the manual which it later revealed. Also, I hide the SSID on my router and I had to give that up to use this camera. I wasn't happy about that, but at least it's password protected.Also, the IR night vision is amazing, but you really can't use it through a window which is what I wanted.Overall 5 stars. For $80 this made me very happy. Just what I wanted. I may get another for the backyard!  Good quality so far.WARNING: If you have an older router, I had a Cisco wireless-G router, this camera will mess up your router.

My husband travels for work often and it'll be nice that he can check in on the baby when he's away. As she gets older, the remote pan/tilt feature will prove useful for when she can get out of bed on her own.Experience with this camera: I like that I can use the monitor in color during the day or black/white night. The sound on the monitor is excellent.Experience with customer service:I am NOT technologically savvy and I was able to set up the camera through my wireless router to be shown on my laptop. I followed the directions for the default user name and password. After install, I decided that I wanted to change the user name and password to make my camera more secure. This is where I hit a roadblock. I couldn't log in to the camera properly after that.... and it was all my fault. I called customer service and they were able to restore everything for me. However, after the call, I tried changing the password again and encountered the same problem.I called back and spoke with another representative. She was able to restore everything a second time and then I asked if she would stay on the line while I attempted to change the password again. She asked me to type slowly to ensure that I wasn't mistyping something. I type very quickly and it was only when I did every letter individually that I was able to discover my error. In the user settings (where you change your password), you can only enter a limited number of characters, but the log-in allows you to enter more characters. Basically, I thought I was making my password something longer than it would allow. Once I realized that the characters were limited, I was able to log-in properly.I haven't set up the camera on my iPhone yet (I need to call my cable provider to open a port, whatever that means). However, the customer service person was able to tell me exactly how I could set it up on my own.Overall, I'm very pleased with this camera and the money I saved in choosing it over monitors that are marketed strictly as baby monitors.

The Foscam fix was to significantly lower the brightness and contrast which resolved the issue but ruined the image quality. This was on the latest firmware as of 7/1/13.\u2022 The quality and size of the image were poor when viewed on my 1080p laptop display.\u2022 Panning was slow and choppy.\u2022 The web server didn't provide any SSL support. All credentials and data were passed unencrypted.\u2022 Ethernet cable provided was flat and recoiled into a spool making it only good for setup. You\u2019ll need a real cable if you want to go wired.\u2022 Provided DDNS solution makes cameras easily detected on the internet.FI8910W Pros\u2022 The web interface was intuitive and easy to use.\u2022 The interface provided the ability to rename default users and to define multiple user classes (i.e. admin, power user, view only).\u2022 Software provided the ability to rename device and define ports.\u2022 I was able to quickly setup apps for my Android phone. I ended up buying \u201cIP Cam Viewer\u201d after trying several tools.\u2022 Wireless worked well and connected easily.\u2022 The included hardware mount and software mirror/flip options provided many possible orientations.\u2022 Field of view on the FI8910W more narrow than the FI9821W. I preferred the FI9810W view.\u2022 Web interface worked well with IE10 and Chrome.\u2022 Software provided the ability to disable the built in LED.\u2022 IR worked very well even in complete darkness.If you\u2019re not frequently panning from light to dark, you don\u2019t intend to expose the web server to the internet  and you\u2019re OK with the resolution, this might be a good solution or you.

(Yes I am one of those over-protective pet-mommies!) I originally bought the Cisco WVC80N but since it didn't pan or tilt I had to buy 4 just to cover half of the blind spots in the room and my dogs like to wander, so at $100 each that was getting too expensive, plus they didn't have 2 way audio, just one way and no night vision. Then I saw this Foscam and since it had good reviews I decided to give it a try. I absolutely love it!Setup was a breeze and I had it working in under a minute (i'm a bit of an electronics geeks so this may not be an average time estimate).The interface is easy to use and gives you multiple options to access the camera feed based on the browser you are using. I've tried it with IE, Firefox, and Chrome and IE gives you the most features (due to ActiveX) but I swear the resolution is better with Firefox (this could be because the image is slightly smaller and so it just appears better quality).I'm not overly thrilled with the Foscam Android app, as it didn't have controls to move the camera but it does have the 2 way audio. However there are plenty of other IP cam apps out there that you can use to control it, I use IPCamViewer Basic.The audio isn't the best, there tends to be feedback when you try to use the microphone while listening to the audio through speakers but its clear enough that my dogs seem to recognize my voice. I used it during a recent thunderstorm to calm my dogs while I was at work.The highest resolution the camera has is 640x480 which isn't the best but its good enough. There is a higher resolution camera from Foscam (I think its the 9810?) that looks like this one for $100 more but for my purposes, and probably most peoples purposes, this resolution is fine. Even in night vision mode the resolution is still pretty decent (at least for a network camera). And by the way night vision mode is awesome! I can easily make out my little pups when they are hiding in the dark corner when the world outside gets too scary.Overall I can't say enough good things about this camera. I highly recommend it, for its price point I think its one of the best on the market. Though a warning to all pet parents who have nosy animals, make sure you put it up high.

I bought this to replace my Samsung baby monitor (see my other review). that I paid twice as much for. Compared to the baby monitor this thing has an outstanding picture. The night vision is so clear! The tilt and pan are fabulous for tracking my son if he is playing and moving around the room. The mounting is decent, enough cord to keep the unit far out of reach (important if your child is old enough and curious).  The cons are the red lights for the infra red could upset my son if he wakes up - so far he has not complained. Also, the audio has a delay and the 2 way audio has interference and is useless. Because of the audio delay I bought a simple audio monitor (see my Motorola review) for nighttime in case my little one cries.  At one AM I am not going to examine the video anyway.

Ordered via Amazon (sold and fulfilled by Amazon). Foscam now states that they do consider Amazon to be an authorized reseller, so at least that is an improvement from the past.My computer is an iMac running OSX 10.8.4. My router was made by Netgear.Setup:-I followed the instructions and plugged the camera into my router with ethernet wire supplied. Plugged in power cable also.-Installed the IP Camera Tool software (provided on the CD) onto my iMac. Logged into the camera via the software and everything looked good. Next, I needed to unplug the wire to set it up for wireless use on my home network.-First step of \"specifying an http port number\" other than 80 was fairly simple. Keep in mind that I really don't know what they mean by all the \"port\" talk. I just followed the instructions and everything went smoothly at this point.-My internet service supplier (Comcast) gives me a \"static IP address\", i.e. it always stays the same number no matter when I use my computer. So I could skip all of the DynamicIP Address stuff. I think that made it a lot easier for me.-At this point, the badly written installation manual makes it seem like you might be done, but no. Onward...-Next step was \"port forwarding\", whatever that means. The tricky thing here (for novices) is that the manual just says \"login to the router\". Uhh...what the hell? How do I do that?! No instructions. (At this point, the techy people reading this review are slapping their foreheads and/or getting a cramp from laughing).-I finally figured out how to get logged into my Netgear router by going to Netgear's website.-Then I followed the instructions to setup \"port forwarding\".At that point, I could get on the internet and go to the correct URL (they explain how to figure this out) and see the camera's view. Everything worked ok.Before I went any further, I used the IP Camera Software again to change the password for the camera. (the default is no password which did not sound very secure).So far, so good. Only problem is that when you use a Mac computer to view the camera, you can not hear any audio. After doing some research on the internet, there seems to be no way to solve this problem at this point.BUT the good news is that if you use the iCam app on your iPhone or iPad (like I do) then you will be able to hear the audio and see the video as well as control the pan/tilt of the camera.So for me, everything works fine, but it was a bit of a headache to set it up. The installation manual needs a thorough re-write by a NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER who tests the process each step of the way. Note that this is different than getting a native English speaker to brush up the grammar on the badly written manual. There needs to be a much simpler logic and flow written into the installation manual. Amazing that Foscam can not figure this out yet after thousands of complaints on Amazon.Finally, I just want to say that I feel there are hundreds of fake reviews here on Amazon for this product. Typically they are short, give 5 stars, and mention what great tech support they received from Mary, Lisa, Juan, etc. Another Amazon reviewer mentioned that it appears these fake reviews are being done by Foscam's tech support staff overseas. I am not sure if these allegations are true, but they sound genuine to me. In my view, if this is true, these fraudulent reviews must be stopped and past ones must be deleted by Foscam/Amazon. This is serious unethical behavior! Minus one star on this review as a penalty.Summary, it's a 4 star product with a 2 star installation manual for an average of 3 stars, BUT minus one star for unethical fake reviews allegedly by Foscam tech support staff.

I first connected the camera directly to my router via the supplied Ethernet cable, installed the camera s/w that came with it on my Windows 7 system and followed the easy instructions in the manual. It gets an IP address from the router and in my case decided to use a fixed mode (preferable to DHCP as the number will never change). It also asks you for a port number (you pick a number between 1000 and 20,000) which is used later for monitoring from outside your own house network. Write down the IP address of the camera and the port number that you have chosen as you will need it later.I then disconnected the camera from the router, unplugged the power cord and rebooted it. I was then able to place the camera anywhere in the house and see the video on my laptop using a browser. All the camera needs is a power outlet. I added an add-on to my browser and was also able to hear sound from the room where the camera was located and was also able to talk to anyone in the room - with significant delay, but very useable. The is basically a web server. From the webpage that you receive from the camera, you can move the lens left ant right and up and down. If there is not enough light in the room, you can also turn the Infrared mode on. What you see is a B&W; image, even if it is in the middle of the night with the room completely dark. I then tested it using my laptop running Windows Vista and it worked fine. No s/w to install, all you use is your browser (IE, Firefox, Chrome or Safari which you point to the IP address of your camera (more on this later). It also works fine from mobile devices like iPhones, iPads, Android tablets and Android phones. I tried them all. The only things missing from the iOS and Android devices is the audio as no plugin is available for those devices.There are many other services that you can setup (like sending you an email in response to motion or sound in the room). These are not described in the little manual that comes with the camera but are fully described in the User Manual found online for this camera. You can change all these setting from the same web screen where your video shows up.My next step was to add the ability to view the video stream from outside my home network. This setup is well described in the online User Manual. It is simple but involves you logging into your router and set up \"Port forwarding\" to route traffic coming to your router for this port to go to the internal IP address of your IP Camera.. The support section of the FOSCAM website has lots of information on how to do this. Once you have done this, you can use your IP Camera from anywhere in the word by browsing to http://ww.xx.yy.zz:#### where ww.xx.yy.zz is the IP address for your incoming house connection and #### the port number that you have chosen when you set up the camera and when you set up the port forwarding.This camera is for indoor use only and has worked very well for me.

I found a couple videos on YouTube that basically showed me how to get it up and running (settings, port forwarding, email/text notifications, Third Party DDNS, etc).So far, it does as advertised. It has reliable motion detection but I am not seeing that it records a steady video stream to your computer or DVR. It can record short video clips (if you use IE for your browser) but you have to leave the application up and running to do so. Not too useful in my case. So if you need or want a video recording, you would likely want a different camera system.One last thing.... the camera requires power so there has to be an outlet close by to plug it into.All in all, I'm happy. I can view the feed from any computer or from my Android app at any time. I get texts and emails with multiple pictures when motion is detected... and no monthly fees from a monitoring company.

But if you want an inexpensive solution that works, is easy to install if you have at least a little bit of tech saavy, and provides a fantastic web cam experience that offers TOP NOTCH infrared night viewing along with complete remote control of side to side and up and down panning, then this is the camera to get!The software that comes with the camera is no frills, granted, but it allows you to do what you need to do to get it setup. Setup was no more than connecting the camera to my router via an ethernet cable, running the software on my computer which found the camera immediately, configuring the camera as needed,  then disconnecting the camera from the router, and it ran wirelessly no problem. I could access it internally on my network via Web browser and via their FREE Android app. I eventually paid $4 for an app called \"IP Cam\" which works fantastic with this cam and allowed me to setup my tablets around the house as additional nanny cams. So lots of viewing options.You have to know a little bit about how to configure your router to enable viewing from outside of your network, but since FosCam doesn't TRY to make things idiot proof (like other cam solutions that fail miserably) there is no lame interface to fight through to get what you need done, done.  I was able to set up port forwarding on my router to my cams, and Viola!  Access from anywhere protected by non-standard port allocation (choose a port number, don't go with the default),  user name, and password.Now I'm viewing my cam from literally anywhere (even on my phone while driving I can have the cam on and hear everything that goes on).Their tech is quick to respond as well, and answered my questions to the point and accurately.Here is a list of reasons why I like this cam:1) The Night Vision is OUTSTANDING! Literally clear as day, in pitch black.2) FosCam had a free app for our phones allowing us to view the camera from as many monitors as needed.3) There is a paid app ($4) from a third party developer out there that give you all kinds of functionality not available in the free app that we purchased.4) We have the viewing app on Multiple Devices, allowing me, the wife, and the nanny to view the cam at the same time from different locales in the house. Have it on a tablet too, and can view from the computer.5) The app supports MANY cams so you can purchase as many as you need and view them all at the same time. We have two to monitor the play area and the sleep area.6) If you have a little networking know-how you can set up the cam to be viewable (safely and securely) from outside the home. Both me and the wife check in on our tots while we are at work.7) The paid app has a background monitoring feature so that you can continue to monitor the baby with Audio as you do other things on your phone, or just sleep with the phone near the bed and the screen off.8) The app alerts you with a sound of your choosing when your little one starts moving around, giving you a little advance notice of the pending AWAKENING!9) Two way audio.And most all of these features are also available via a web browser if needed.Setting the camera up on the local network is a breeze.  Setting it up for safe secure viewing outside of the home takes a little bit more know-how, but is obviously very doable.  And there are directions, and good support. You can also assign different passwords for different people so that you can always revoke access at anytime, for any specific viewer (such as if you need to fire a nanny).The BIGGEST advantage is that you can use any smartphone, tablet, or computer as your viewing device and they can ALL be used at the same time.Very happy with this purchase.", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Would be good if it worked properly", "Author": "wRx7M \"wRx7M\"", "ReviewID": "R3FC5GQL4N4QKJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Was replacing a Linksys WVC54GCA that since Firefox version 20.0, was no longer displaying video (fault of Firefox update and Java).

Since I assigned a static IP address to the camera, my problem has been solved.You have to assign a static IP address within the CAMERA software. Then use that static address and open port forwarding in your ROUTER software.The camera shows a sharp, clear color image in the daytime. The IR nighttime image is black and white but is fantastic for a camera in this price range. You get a picture in absolute darkness. I've ordered 2 more of these. The latest software update to the foscam app is a good one. The camera pans quickly and accurately to the locations you preset.One feature I haven't used and cannot speak for is the automatic notification via email for motion sensing.You can't beat the price or the quality for this camera. Its all about price vs features. I'm sure there are other much more expensive cameras out there with more features, but for home use, this thing thing is great.

My experience has been a like/hate for the last 3 days.First, the camera is not exactly tiny, so discreet it does not do. But I knew that going in. The camera itself functions nicely. It does all the pan and tilt, but like other reviews say, it does not zoom. The IR also works well. So all in all the camera operates well except for one issue. Once a day it will reset itself and return to the 'center', what it considers its starting point. If you want it to always point to one place make sure it's the center.Now the real issue. The software is the worst piece of garbage ever created. I could go into detail but I would be writing a small book. Save yourself some aggravation. Toss it immediately. Find other software that works with the camera. I tried Vitamin D. It works ok, but had issues. First, it does not control pan/tilt. It would lose connection on a 10-15 minute basis. This would create many mp4 files. For some reason the software would create 8-10 processes that I would have to kill. I also had problems panning the camera with the Foscam software. The camera would pan or tilt so far, then freeze. If I hit center fast enough it would move and I could try to re-adjust. Otherwise it would go thru a reboot and go back to center a few minutes later.I then tried WabCamXP 5 which worked great. It does control pan and tilt. I had no issues with the camera freezing when moving. It never lost connect and I ended up with one large avi which is what I wanted. Only thing I missed from Vitamin D was the feature that detects movement so you can go right to that point in the video. Since I was recording constant motion it was not an issue.So in summary the camera works fine. Your mission will be to find the right software to use with it.

Often I use the two-way audio to give them commands.  The original setup was not that difficult if you follow the instructions.  On my network it has a static IP and port mapping allows me to make it available over the Internet.The night vision works well, but does tend to see-through certain thin clothing.  This isn't a big issue, but it is worth noting that it may not be appropriate in some use cases.  During the day the color tends to falter leaving it a little washed out.My experience is that at 12 feet in darkness you can no longer distinguish between objects 1-2 inches in size.  To frame this, if you put a $1 bill on the floor next to a $20 bill you would struggle to identify which is which.  At 20 feet in darkness you will lose edge definition on items.  Anything beyond tends to reach the limit of the infrared range.In bright light you will add a couple of feet to each of the measures above.  The reason for mentioning this is that you may not want to locate the camera in a ceiling where it is inherently 10-12 feet away from any relevant objects.  Also, the camera as pictured with the product has the base pointed down.  To gain the most range of freedom you will want to mount the camera upside-down and flip the rotational axis.  This is supported in the software.The video recording features do not appear to work on my firmware.  The snapshot features require you to login before they work.  I had planned to have the stills grabbed every couple of minutes available to the public and the pan/tilt adjustments requiring a password.  To get around this I had to setup a PHP script to authenticate and store the images on a server.  Then people can access the images without logging in.The audio quality of the microphone is reasonable.  The speaker on the camera is poor and I highly recommend that when mounting the camera you add a set of powered speakers available on Amazon for cheap.The only downside is that there is an upper limit on concurrent viewers on the camera.  After five concurrent viewers the camera tends to become non-responsive to commands through the GUI.  The second camera of the same model with the newer firmware does not have this same issue.  Regardless, I highly recommend this camera and have recommended it to friends.When it finally goes up to 1080p or 720p my goal is to upgrade these units.", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value for the price", "Author": "Saint77", "ReviewID": "R2NX05HJWHV44L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "An excellent full featured camera.

After reading reviews I decided on the Foscam 8910W and 2 of the outdoor 8905(?) cameras.  Hooking them up was easy to do to my wireless network, installing them was a bit of a challenge for me.  Not that it was Foscam's fault, just the ideal locations in my house required a lot of drilling, ladder time, etc.  Anyways after a couple of days of install (working and school full time) the cameras were up and running.  FYI, for the outdoor cameras, I upgraded to a bigger antenna.  Cheap fix and worth it in the long run. I recently upgraded my internet service and the cable company brought in a new dual modem/receiver.  From then on my cameras stopped working. I could access them on my network but not when I left it (ie on my iPhone). I spend countless days and hours trying to find the solution.  I called tech support and Tim came on the phone to help!  He was awesome! I told him about my issue and he  immediately knew what was wrong.  He logged on to my computer, and began working on the issue, checking my router settings, cam settings ,etc.  Without me telling (i forgot to mention it actually) ,he saw I had a router/modem (new one) attached to my other router (older one- which the cameras were on) was not allowing port forwarding.  He fixed the issue and BAM! All cameras pulled up on my iPhone! The whole call took no more than 5 minutes.  I am forever grateful.

I use a cheap Graco sound only monitor to make up for what the foscam lacks for sound quality/reliability.Bottom line: I would definitely recommend this camera to friends/ family in need of a baby monitor. I appreciate the fair price, as many of the \"video baby monitors\" are so over priced and do exactly the same thing.", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Definitely worth the money.", "Author": "Laura Vogel", "ReviewID": "R1GPJXROZ444NW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros:  This is a very inexpensive, high quality camera.  The night vision and auto-light adjustments are great.  It responds to controls well.  It's attractive, non-descript, and works the way it's supposed to work with no hiccups.  I followed the instructions (though they were rather complicated) and it worked on the first try.  While it took me over an hour to set up (and I am a very confident computer user) I didn't hit any frustrating points, nor did I feel compelled to call tech support--this is a HUGE plus for me.Cons:  The problem is that viewing away from home is a difficult set-up that, in most home environments, requires the use of a program on a computer that IS RUNNING the entire time you want to be able to view the camera.  So, if I want to leave home and be able to check in on the camera, I have to leave my computer AT HOME, ON, and RUNNING A THIRD PARTY PROGRAM.  This is frustrating.  Also, it's virtually impossible to get the sound to work unless you use additional equipment (i.e. speakers).  There is no iPhone or Android app, it's just a mobile website that loads slowly and works slowly.My Use:  I'm monitoring my dog's activity in her crate while I'm out of the house.  It works well for that, though I can't take advantage of the auditory features to hear if she's crying or to talk to her to calm her down.  I can see if she needs me home to change her food/water/wee wee pad or if she's freaking out.  The night vision works REALLY well - I can see her moving around even when I only have a lamp on in the house while I'm away.Conclusion:  If sound doesn't matter to you and you're looking for a high-quality video home monitoring system, this is the cheapest way to go that will still work well.  I would love to have a native app for the camera and I'd love for it to have an easier set-up.

The EasyN is superior in EVERY OTHER WAY.Both cameras offer 640x480 images, but the Foscam image looks like something 1/4 that size that was digitally zoomed and makes the somewhat blurry EasyN image look like crystal clear HD in comparison.The Foscam's camera housing is only loosely connected to the base -- it will wobble relative to the base.  The EasyN is solidly constructed.Both are easy to use and their browser interfaces are almost identical, so nothing special there.All-in-all, I think I paid an extra $20 (an extra $35 at regular price) for the IR Cut Filter and a name.

When I bought two goats last summer I had no idea that goats often need assistance with delivering kids.  I grew up with horses and cattle around- and both did fine without assistance!  I picked up this camera her at Amazon, and hooked programed it on the router after work, then had it in the barn and aimed into the goat pen that night.I'm a technically competent person, and I read directions - that being said this is very straight forward and I had no issues.  I downloaded the app for my Motorola Bionic and was upstairs and in bed, watching the goats on the camera in no time.  I have to confess that I was up almost all night because both goats kept staring at it - and I could TALK through it!  OMG sooo funny!  You could see them stare at the camera, then look at the barn door like \"she must be just outside the door!\"  They would get up and walk over to the camara location, stand up on the side of the pen and investigate.  Talk about \"Men who stare at Goats\" - I couldn't leave them alone!In the end it worked exactly as I needed.  I could see a clear image to tell that the doe was in labor, and when things looked intense I was able to step in and try to help.Pros:  EASY to install and set up  Crisp image  Easy to Pan and Zoom  Easy to connect the cell phone over WiFi  GREAT infrared image - very easy to see what was going onCons: It's difficult to set up the remote feature if you don't have access to the router that your Internet provider owns.I didn't have access to my AT&T; router, and I didn't have hours to sit through their customer help line.

They are simple to setup, if you know what you're doing.  I can't stress that enough.  If you aren't familiar with computers, networking, etc...  You aren't going to have much fun setting this camera up.  That being said, if you do know what you're doing, this camera can be up in running with at least just basic viewing within minutes.  I can't speak much to the features of the camera such as the FTP and email alerts and so on.  I have both of these cameras feeding into a server running Blue Iris software.  So have I haven't really explored any of the additional features.  So far they the original one has been up without issue for a few months now.  Both of mine are running over wifi and the video quality is just fine.  The pan and tilt functionality seems to work just fine.  I am pretty impressed with how well you can see in pitch black rooms with this camera.  Unfortunately, I don't know exactly what the effective distance of night time viewing is because the bedrooms I have these setup in are only about 12-15 feet at their longest but I have no issues seeing the entire room with them.For those who are under the impression that you get a free ddns account with one of these cameras, you technically do.  The DDNS service is bound to the actual device.  It's labeled right on the box that it's bound to the individual camera, and the DDNS URL is right on the bottom.  That doesn't mean that you can go to a 3rd party companies website and expect them to give you free DDNS service they otherwise charge for.Overall for the money I'm pretty happy with my purchase.  I wish they had zoom functionality, but I understand that would come with a higher price tag.

Two things to note with this camera:1. the range of the Wi-Fi with the included antenna is limited. Depending upon where it is installed there are several solutions. For example, you can get a pair of 9db antennas for the router and the camera to get a little more distance, but for longer distances you need to get more creative.  I put this camera in the basement to keep on eye on the kids. This is 2 stories down from the Verizon router, so  I am using a pair of network powerline plugs to get a good internet connection to the basement, then connected a second wireless router which is set up as an access point for the ip camera to connect.  Alternatively I could have run a Ethernet cable from the camera to the powerline plug in the basement, but with the wireless access point we can connect multiple devices.2. second complaint is I am still having an issue getting IE to connect to the camera via activex.  I read a lot of forums offering solutions, and adjusted the activex settings in IE as stated on the foscam support site, but am not having luck.  I don't want to spend more $$ on the Blue Iris software, so I will continue to look for a solution because the only way to get 2 way sound via a computer is using IE.  Other browsers do not offer sound.Tip: Tech savy people may know this, but for the rest of us: if you intend on accessing the camera from within the same network as the camera, then use the 192.168.x.x:xxxx address because it works a little faster.

They set up a remote link to your pc and they configure all of the settings and will get the camera up and running. The camera has a built in mic and speaker for remote monitoring and communication. The picture is good in daylight and at night. Don't expect a high def picture. Just a good quality which is all I need. I set up the motion detection which works very well.

For reference the setting for yahoo and sbcglobal.net are smtp.mail.yahoo.com port # is 465 select TLS from drop down menu. Check the box under the TLS menu as well. There are also several you tube videos with detailed set up instructions. There is a good gmail one from the manufacturer. I also purchased the Foscam pro app from the App Store for my ipad and iphone. I highly recommend this app. It works great and was easy to set up.

I did everything I thought I was supposed to such as adding the new router password codes, etc...the camera did work when plugged into the Ethernet, just not wirelessly, again contacted tech support and Ron Jacob fixed what was wrong. My IR went out after 3 months of use, wasn't a big deal to me since I have motion lights in the yard. I did mention it to Ron Jacob and he said to watch it for a few days since we had to reboot the camera itself and that should fix the IR problem.

The camera has two modes; and ActiveX mode for viewing with Internet Explorer, and a Server Push mode for viewing with other browsers.  This security issue only affects the Server Push mode.  The problem is, often when I have logged in once, it stops asking for passwords on subsequent logins.  For example, this morning I logged in from home, and it asked me for the password.  Later in the day I logged in from work and it did not ask for a password.  I have the camera on a timer switch so that it powers down and restarts every morning, which clears the credentials.  This doesn't happen every time, so there may be some caching going on.This could be a problem if you log in as an administrator, then someone else stumbles across the URL and has full access to change passwords, etc.There is no logout button in the interface, so if this does happen to you, you need to reboot the camera, which is available through the interface (although that seems a little heavy handed).I have posted this concern to the Foscam forum as well.", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great surveillance camera, far exceeded my expectations", "Author": "Fabio H", "ReviewID": "REQW4LQ74OTTU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy setup, although for a non-tech person I can see where it could get difficult, but it goes like this:- Connect camera to power outlet- Connect camera with provided ethernet cable to your internet router at home- Check your router to see what IP was assigned to the camera- Connect to the camera's web interface at the IP assigned by router- Connect camera to wireless network, set it so that it is a fixed IP, configure port to port 88- Disconnect camera from wired network, plug/unplug power cord so it reboots and attaches to network- Configure router port forwarding per your manual- Adjust camera settings, and prefixes.- Download FoscamPro app from iTunes store if you have an iPhone. Works EXCELLENT.The reason you might want to choose port 88, is that some internet service providers will block port 80 incoming to your account (to prevent web servers from running on a non-commercial account).It's a good idea to set a fixed IP on the camera, and reserve that IP on the router, so that whenever your camera reboots and your DHCP IP lease expires, you might end up getting a whole new different IP and you might end up with connectivity issues. I believe with uPnP you don't have this issue, but I'd rather do it the static IP address way, it'll be more reliable.Up and running in about 20 minutes.

That would not be the first time for this type of camera. It is my third of the type. I think my first was a Foscam knockoff. It's still in use at my vacation cottage and it outside under a protective overhang. It did not work well inside because the lights made seeing through a window at night impossible. The second was an earlier model Foscam. After 8 months of use, it ceased to by accessible from the Internet. But it still sends me email messages from the cottage when the motion detector spots something.A bit of previous experience made this product only mildly annoying in the setup. I already had the camera tool on the computer. So I didn't bother with whatever was on the CD. So I hooked it to the Ethernet cable and had it operating wirelessly in about 2 minutes. Then I changed the port to 425 and put that in the router upnp setup. No luck adding 425 to my IP address for getting Internet access. But after messing around with the device management settings, I found what I needed under \"Upnp settings.\" I clicked on the box for \"Using upnp to Map Port.\" And voila. I could access the camera from the Internet.The view is nice and sharp. But problems come up whenever I pan. I lose connections with the camera and have to connect again. Sometimes that is easy. Other times not. Not something I need to put up with and not something I will mention to the notorious Foscam customer support. Unless someone quickly tells me about a quick fix, the camera will go back to Amazon for an exchange.At my cottage, I have a couple Panasonic network cameras. They have all sorts of bells and whistles. Zoom, microphones and speakers. But when they crash, they can only be reset by sticking a pin the the little reset hole. I have access to the cottage network via Logmein and was able to reset the Foscam knockoff from afar. But not the Panasonic cameras. I could not get them going remotely following a crash caused by my ISP changing the IP address.This latest purchase is for keeping an eye on things at my principal residence. I could do that with this camera, but there is no reason to put up with the flaws. Back to Amazon for an exchange unless someone tells me about a miracle cure for the flaws.UPDATE: The camera went through a few hours of operating without crashes. But then it was back to crashes whenever I made it pan. So I have returned it. An exchange for a non defective model was not possible because the camera does not come directly from Amazon. But I have ordered a new one.FURTHER UPDATE: The replacement came fast and it worked fine. I now have three of these. So setup has become almost routine. But sometimes setting up for Internet access can take a bit of time. I sometimes go through several port setting in the camera and the router before getting a port that will work. Ports in the low 400s seem to work best.

I did try, but the router and networking tech issues were beyond my purview. Felix at tech support was helpful and set up 2 cams so I could view in at home, remotely, and on my droid phone. Tech support (\"Felix\") was very helpful and got the 2 cams up and running. So far so good! Tech support uses TeamViewer to access your PC and install remotely - you watch everything in real time.Update Feb 2014: my wireless router (quite old) started malfunctioning and I bought a new one. This meant I had to reconfigure the cameras, which I had been dreading, since tech support really did the whole thing for me when I got the cameras. It took about 2 hours but I got the cameras working on the Win laptop, and configured the port forwarding so I could view from my smart phone and tablet. This time I did it all by myself! Unlike a smart TV, smart phone, or tablet, these cameras have to have a hard reset to switch over to a new wireless router. They also do a couple POST tests in the process. I had kept the setup pamphlet and also drew on what I remembered when Foscam did it (foscam had left me with a .txt file that had my remote IP addresses, etc, and that was indispensable). I still use the original management software that came with the cameras, which I find good enough. On the phone and tablet, I use a free app called IP Cam Lite. The remote IPs I use are Foscam IPs, unique to my cameras, and use is free for 3 years. After that, I'll pay them or maybe just get a cheaper one from No IP. Who knows where tech will be in two years?I believe that the new router, and its slicker web interface, were a huge help in setting up this time, too.

They are very easy to access and use because they are IP cameras, but the software they provide is 100% browser based and lacks in functionality... ESPECIALLY if you don't run it in Internet explorer. If you attempt to access the camera in Chrome you will not be able to record to a file on the local machine, and will not have several other options available to you. Also there is no standalone software which means if you want to record you will be paying for a third party software, writing your own, or trying to remember to keep IE on and logged into the cameras.The cameras I received were constantly rebooting so I had to send them back. I replaced them with 2 8910's from a another seller and while they work ok, they are not perfect...Another thing to note these may be wireless but YOU STILL MUST PLUG THE POWER IN. The real problem with this is the cable they supply is a \"wall wart\" and is about 4 or 5 feet long. Meaning wherever you want to install this better have an outlet. Because these cameras run on 5 watts and 2.5 amps you cannot power them on the stock adapters if you attempt to run a line to them through a ceiling unless you are willing to run a real power line and install an outlet. You are not getting more than about ten feet of extension via splicing.If I had this to do over again I'd have either paid for wired cameras (since I need to wire them anyway) or paid an extra 20-30$ for POE ready cameras.One nice thing to mention is there is some programmatic access to the controls via CGI so if you are a programmer you can have some fun with these.", "Date": "March 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good product.", "Author": "John C.

If they can't get 640 frame rates very high, then HD would be unusable.

Just give the camera a static ip, use port forwarding on your router and then point your camera software to your external IP and voila; your done.In summary, I am happy enough with this, but had a bit higher expectations.

Easy to install, I followed the directions in the manual.  I didn't have a firewall or anti-virus, and disabled MAC filtering before installing.  First set-up was a succes, until I turned MAC filtering back on and lost the camera and my router crashed.  After getting everything back up, tried again.  This time I left on MAC filtering on and entered the two MAC addresses on the stickers on the bottom of the camera.  Everything worked out good.  Camera works and I can view from an app on my android phone.  But, I haven't activated port forwarding yet and viewed from a web browser.  A couple of things about the camera:  The video is a little choppy.  The movements are a little delayed and not that smooth.  The camera also makes this constant clicking sound and is noisy when it pans.  Not sure if this is normal, going to email Foscam tech support and find out.  Also, I am having a couple other problems, but am not sure if it's the fault of the camera or the app.  I first installed the tinyCam app and the pan/tilt arrows did not work so I installed the IP Cam Viewer Pro.  IP Cam Viewer Pro works, however there is a delay when using the arrows for panning and tilting.  You hit the arrow and have to wait a few seconds before it actually moves.  Annoying.  And I've been able to Listen using the camera, but the talk function isn't working.  I don't know if it's the app or the camera.  I am going to give it a few days then I'll update this review.UPDATE 03/19 -- Realized the video is choppy and delayed because of my poor Sprint 3G wireless connection. If you use the android app over wi-fi the video is much smoother. The responsiveness of the pan/tilt is also dependent on how well your wireless connection is. Also, when exploring the setting in the IP Cam Viewer Pro app on my phone I realized you have to enable two-way audio, so I can now use the Talk function. However, it doesn't work all the time and when it does, the volume on this is very low...I have to figure out if I can turn this up.", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Security Camera", "Author": "dissatisfied", "ReviewID": "R23V4VFWTQGVMJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased the Foscam F18910W 2pack.

I've been wanting to upgrade to a more modern and reliable system for a while. The other day we were in Target and happened to come across this Foscam FI8910W on clearance for half off. Yup, I was shocked too. It was a store return, but we couldn't pass up the deal. Maybe someone got it for Xmas and didn't know what to do with it cuz nothing looked like it had even been removed from the box. This great bargain got us thinking about getting another one, and that's when we ran across this newly upgraded model, the Foscam FI8916W with a Better Housing and the Newest ModelThe biggest difference between the 2 is the new housing; it's sleeker and has a ball and socket lens atop a swooped arm.  Other than that, the basic footprint is the same to this model.  The entire swooped arm rotates during pan, and just the ball on top tilts.  It's actually pretty cool.  Other than that, it seems to be exactly the same as this older tried and true model.Paint it Yellow and You Got a MinionThis Foscam FI8910W looks like a one-eyed minion from the movie Despicable Me -- Deluxe Plush Minion.  It's cute and I like the shape and look of it. It's cool, but the new model is cooler.Velvety FeelReally like the matte finish, and nice rubberized kinda texture feels really great to the touch. Makes the cam look and feel like a top notch, quality product.Easy SetupI've read some of the problems others have had setting this up, but all went smooth as silk for me.  I used the included setup disk and just went step by step, barely glancing at the instructions.  If you have any experience setting up WiFi devices, then you'll have no problem with this. If you've never done anything like this before, then it's a good time to learn. It's basically just an SSID and password, and a user interface accessed via an IP address and your favorite web browser. I was up and running and viewing my cam within 10 minutes on my Win 7 laptops.Compatible BrowsersI don't use iE for anything, so no words of wisdom there. But for me, the included software seems to play nicer with Firefox than Chrome. But overall, both worked fine for me. I'm considering the Foscam Blue Iris Pro. Seems like it might be worthwhile. I downloaded the 15 day trial and am still playing with it.Mounting BracketNice touch! Just mount with a couple screws, and a hand-twist camera mount screw. Screws and anchors are included, but I used my own self-drilling screws; much easier to work with and more secure.Port ForwardingI have a pretty tight firewall, so I had to setup some custom ports and forwarding rules. Again, if you have experience with it, no biggie; if not, it's only a couple paragraphs of reading and you'll be up to speed.Wireless SimplicityOnce the initial setup is done via a wired connection, just enter the setup menu and input your SSID and password, and you're set for wireless. This is where this cam excels over Logitech Wilife. No electrical wiring network communication = no time delays or surge protector interference. Definitely getting more of these Foscam's over time and fazing out this old Wilife crap!Pan & TiltLike budduh! No more blind spots! Sure, I have my fave happy place for the angles, but love the option of pan & tilt. Especially handy to get that perfect viewing angle, but also very nice to have the mobility if I want it. Commands from the software to camera are very snappy and on the dot. Precise, responsive and a huge convenience and security enhancement.Auto PanSetup a motion path for the lens to follow. Very nice way to expand and automate the viewable coverage area.Easy-Peasy Smartphone IntegrationWatch your cams on your cell phone and tablet. I actually prefer connecting via a remote viewing app, like Splashtop or TeamViewer. It's just easier, but you do need to have an accessible computer on site. Otherwise, just connect to these cams directly via the Foscam app. Worked well on my Android tab.Bottom Line -- this is a really nice security cam setup. I think I'll upgrade our whole system and just add more of these cams over time. Easy to use. Nice image quality. Pan and tilt. Decent price. I'm partial to the newer model's design, but still like this one and glad to have gotten such a great half-off deal on it at Target.

The video quality is obviously not the best out there, but purely as a cheap monitoring device it delivers. The pan and tilt works well, and with the installed camera pro app on android, you can control it remotely. The night vision capabilities are average. From what I have read somewhere, security of this camera is a cause of concern. Apparently, the camera can be easily hacked into. Dont have any hard evidence, but if you would like to use it as a supporting system that you turn on and off, it shouldnt be a huge concern.Very few cons I can think of1.

I tested the audio and right away I knew there was an issue.  I was able to listen, but I could not use the microphone.  The speaker on the cam is so distorted and at a low level, that I thought I must have a defected camera!  That is when I did some research, and discovered this camera is known for audio issues and Foscam is aware of the problem.  Their solution?  They will ship you a repair kit and instructions, in which you must open up the camera, switch the wires and then solder them together!!

It is almost like having someone hold a gun to your head and tell you to write a review.  It is borderline cyber bullying in my humble opinion.  I mean hey, if you're not tech savvy and need help installing these cameras, and you have someone who IS tech savvy in full control of your computer, how likely are you going to be to write a bad review with them watching?  I, personally, wondered what they would do while in control of my computer at that point, so i terminated the team viewer and hung up on the tech person rather than be forced to write a raving review I DID NOT MEAN.Bottom line:  If you're not an expert in port forwarding and networking, steer clear.

I am, frankly, in awe of how much time Foscam dedicates to helping its customers. Installation is simple - and complex. Setting  up the camera to be recognized on your internal LAN is pretty much within anyone's capability, if they will read the short manual. Making the camera accessible from the internet can be a lot more difficult. You have to create a \"pinhole\" or forward a port so the camera will be reachable from the internet. Depending on your router, this can be relatively simple since Foscam provides instructions on its very well-done support website for a number of popular routers. Take it slow, read the directions over and over until you feel comfortable and it should be easy. I use AT&T; and it has been so long since I had to create a pinhole that I forgot how to do. AT&T; doesn't provide manuals or documentation. And telephone AT&T; tech support doesn't know anything except how to refer you to a for-fee AT&T; service. If Comcast weren't even worse than AT&T;, I'd go back to them. Anyway, I got the pinhole set up and delighted in the pretty sharp 640x480 video the Foscam FI8910W produces. The software provided by Foscam does a good job. You can pan and tilt. The IR illuminators do a good job when the room is dark, but don't expect a lot of detail. Foscam provides a unique DDNS service so you can access your camera from any internet connected device. So far, so good. And then I wanted to set the Foscam up so it would send me an email whenever motion was detected in the coverage area. I was flummoxed. Despite following the instructions on the Foscam web page, I couldn't get it to work. So after checking the forums, I called Foscam tech support expecting less than stellar performance. How wrong I was. I dealt with Leo, who is simply superb. We walked through the process using a Teamviewer remote connection, engaged in some surprisingly rigorous troubleshooting and got the problem resolved, I was pleased with the product to begin with, but with the kind of tech support Leo provided, I will now freely admit to being a Foscam fanboy.

It ****works awesome**** using activex on IE. The other option is to use VLC and you can hear the audio but obviously you cannot talk back. They should have used some other plugin to provide two way audio.2) The manufacturer has some control issues I think. To even download firmware updates, we have to provide them with email address, validate the email address and then they will send firmware download links by email.

Setting a single camera up is pretty easy. If you are like me and hate reading manuals, Foscam has created some videos in the support section of their website. This is what I used for setup, Port forwarding and recording. The cameras network well with a G router but I will probably go to an N as I add more than three or four cameras and have several computers on the same router. I have tested the recording on, Quicktime, Windows Media Player and ATI's recording app. I think I like Windows Media player the best since you can fast scan the recordings when you get home if needed. When recording you can adjust the frame rate. This is a great option since you have some control on how much hard drive space is used and also helpful if you are using an older computer with a smaller hard drive than in more current computers. It can also be helpful if you have multiple cameras recording. I tested this and recorded at the 2 frames per second speed and only used 800 meg for about 9 hours of recording for one camera. It will go down to as low as 1/5 frames per second. There are many frame rate speeds going as high as 20 frames per second and there is max but I'm not sure what that number is but the video is smooth. You can also adjust the camera resolution as well to help manage hard drive usage. You can choose between 320 x 240 or 640 x 480. You can connect to your camera remotely using various browsers. I have used both Google and IE explorer and they both work fine however I found that the pan tilt is faster and smoother with IE Explorer. Hooking up additional cameras is easy but setting the second one up for remote access using one browser was a little tricky for me. Foscam tech support helped me with this so once you know how to do that you can keep adding cameras with no problem. I have my cameras mounted on my window sill so I can point them outside to check on things then swing them inside to check on the inside of the house. Please note Foscam has a line of outdoor cameras. The cameras have infrared lights so you can see things at night. They of course will not go threw the glass to light up outside but you can open up the camera lens and you can see pretty well outside at night. The infrared lights seem to light up a distance a little more than Foscam claims which is a good thing. I can see pretty far into my house with no light. The 18910 has pretty good accurate color. Foscam offers a line accessories to help mount the cameras however if none of them work for you you can easily customize a mounting bracket for about $4 at you local hardware store. As I am writing this review I am sitting at my folks house and looking at the corner of my screen watching what going on outside and the inside of  my house 12 miles away. I like that and it make me feel secure. If you need help with more information Foscam has an online demo of their cameras so you can test them out. You can also call Foscam and ask for Sandra or any of the other folks and they will help you pick the right camera for you. I plan to purchase several more soon. As an added note in order to get free tech support and 2 year warranty you will need to go to the Foscam website and click \"where to buy\".

Initially, I was researching the Logitech Security Camera system due to their easy setup & convenience. However, Logitech cameras cost a lot more, and the homeplug feature seemed too bulky. As I did further research via amazon reviews, there were customer reports that Logitech cameras failed within 2 years of usage and there were also hidden fees for remote access! Logitech also prevents backwards compatibility, so newer models can result in new software rendering your existing Logitech security system obsolete. The Logitech was both pricey & not reliable, so I continued the search for something more affordable which led to the Foscam. Most of the negative reviews regarding the Foscam are due to the wireless LAN setup, it took me about 3 days to understand and setup the camera because I had no prior experience regarding port routing, DNS, etc.I would definitely look up on youtube and search \"awkward hamster foscam\" view the tutorials 1) basic setup 2)how to access camera via android,web, etc. After viewing this tutorial, you will figure out whether or not you are ready to meet this challenge.

I needed pan/ tilt, and night vision.  However, I didn't want to spend over $200 since he is my third (and i think last!) child!  This was recommended to me.  It's more of a legit security camera.  The monitor is your computer, or any mobile device.  I can monitor from my desktop, ipad, android or iphone (some apps are better than others but all function the same).  The set up is a little tricky if you are not a techie (we are not!)  We were able to do the basic set up (we thought) but it wasn't working properly and the helpful tech support was able to log into my computer remotely and set it up FOR me in about 10 minutes... that was soooo helpful.  Works like a charm.  I can monitor from anywhere in my house using my wifi, or anywhere in the world using a domain name (haven't tried this yet though).  There is a speaker to talk from your device into the room (helpful when you see little one getting into something bad!)  The installation bracket works well to adjust to your needs and the best angle/ view.  And of course, you can remotely move the camera around and it seems to be quiet as it moves.  The picture is perfectly clear.  Color in light and gray shades for night vision.  For the price, this is the best buy you are going to get as a baby monitor.  The ones marketed to parents are marked up like crazy!  So happy I found this.  I think you  can also add more cameras to monitor other areas and see them all on the screen and this can be re-purposed when baby gets older.  Don't hesitate.

If you have never messed with wireless cameras and such before, it takes a little effort to get started. Foscam has a pretty decent website with videos to help walk you through it. My opinion is  that they have gotten better and more helpful over time. They also put out firmware updates and appear to address issues that users have had.The user interface isn't great, but it isn't bad either. It will work with Android although it behaves and functions a bit differently. I have experienced the occassional difficulty connecting to a camera, that usually sorts itself out after repeated attempts. But I will also say that I've seen that kind of thing with a Linksys at more than 3 times the price and I think the video is better with the Foscam.I know some people have had some issues, but I'll just add that there are a number of things you can do wrong. It pays to watch their videos before trying to set one up. The oldest one I have, I've had for quite awhile, and it still works fine. I have since bought more.These are pretty nice cameras for the money and they have some nice features.

As other users have said setup can be challenging. It took me a week to figure out, but now it is working smoothly. I have set up motion detect alarm, e-mail setup, dns set up (really not needed, but I will explain later), port forwarding and iphone app set up. I was disappointed initally because the set up cd came broken. However, I was able to download the application from foscam website. Once the software is loaded and the camera is connected to the PC, the IP address for the camera will pop-up. Please note the IP number. I think most users get confused with the IP numbers. For a typical home with a router, there will be a Router that assigns a LAN IP number, most likely 198.168.1.1. Once the camera is connected the IP address for the camera will pop 198.168.1.3 (in my case). The last number after the dot will be different for each device connected to the LAN. Keep in mind you cannot access the camera from the outside using this IP address. For that you need to find your WAN IP address. You can use the site whatsmyip.com and search for your WAN address. In my case it was 68.199.xx.xxx. This WAN IP address is important if you want to connect to your camera from the internet. Don't be fooled when you are able to connect within your wifi using the 198.168.. IP address. You are within the network and will be able to connect easily. Typing the camera's IP address (198.168.1.3 in my case)you can access the camera's set up menu. In User setting, you can change the login name and password from the default provided by foscam. You can create administrator and visitor privileges also. Please set the image recording path. Keep in mind recording will take place only if the PC or an USB external drive is always on. In Basic Network setting, enter the IP address. For me 198.168.1.3, Subnet mask 255.255.255.0 could be the same for all (otherwise check the router administration page). Gateway & DNS server is the IP address of router 198.168.1.1. I have read lot of issues in using port 80, so enter a new port. I used 5656. If you have a Netgear router provided by Optimum online. You can enter the routers IP address on main address bar and a login page will pop up. For optimum online the login name is admin and password is optimum. Sorry for going off track. In the Wireless LAN settings, enter your wireless ID and password. If you press the scan button it will display your network also. You can skip the other menu option. If you want to access your camera with a domain name like [...] instead of[...] you will need to set a DNS host/redirect. You can get a free DNS redirect option at[...] The problem with free account is you will have to renew by email every month. I think paid option is $20 for a year. I have set up a free account. In the camera's DDNS settings menu, you will have to enter the details of your DDNS Service, user name and password used to access the service and the domain you have with the provider. In mail service the sender and receiver will be your e-mail address. For yahoo, the SMTP server will be smtp.mail.yahoo.com and port is 465. For your mail provider you can find the details of the server and port by doing an internet search. SMTP user and pasword will by e-mail address before the @ and the password. This mail service is to send you e-mail with attachment of the photos when a motion detect alarm is triggered. Please check the boxes, you don't have to test it now. in the Alarm Service settings menu, check all the boxes and keep sensitivity at 5. Duration to record as 60 secs or less. You can select the time for the motion detect to work and hit submit. Basically the camera set-up is over. Now go to your router administration page as explained earlier. Make sure your camera shows up in the devices connected menu. Remember camera is connecting wirelessly, no need to connect with ethernet cable after the initial set up is over. In the Port Forwarding menu add the camera with its IP address (198.162.1.3 for me). Enter starting and ending port at 5656. While setting up domain name in noip.org use the WAN address (68.199.xx.xxx) with port 5656 to point to the domain name. It might take a few minutes to register. Now you can access your camera either by your domain name [...]or [...] from inside and outside of your network. The[...]can only be used to access within the wifi network. I also used a free iphone app CamViewer and entered the domain name to see the camera from outside the network. You can test the app and domain name by turning off the wifi in your phone.

Matching up the position of the controls, I set a static IP address and a different port number, accepted the changes, and stop the IP Camera Tool. After a minute I launched the IP Camera Tool and saw the camera listed as expected. I then accessed my router and forward the port to the IP address for the camera, and was able to access it remotely.The things that annoyed me was the dialog window having only question signs (??????) for all of the labels. What kind of software bug was that? Was it not localized properly? The labels resolved themselves only after I figured out and entered the values.

I think Tim could have been a little more vocal during the troubleshooting, but customer service at most companies has been trained to only provide solutions, not talk customers through the process, so I can't blame him.  I guess providing solutions is good for a significant number of customers, but I feel like I am pretty technical and like to be involved in troubleshooting.

It was relatively easy to setup, although the IP scanner tool included on the software CD doesn't seem to work with Windows 7. I had to get the IP address from my router's DHCP client list. Aside from that, setup was pretty easy and went according to the included instructions. Foscam's website has some pretty decent step by step instructions on topics such as port forwarding so you can view your camera via internet as well as on your local network.The power cord that comes with it is comically short for a device that is almost certainly going to be mounted high on a wall or from the ceiling. Thankfully, Foscam sells a 10' extension for \"only\" $15.I can't figure out why they decided that the ring of LEDs around the lens should emit visible light. They are supposed to be IR LEDs but they are clearly visible. That could be just some of the light filtering through from the ridiculously bright LED status light on the back of the unit. Neither is so bright as to keep my daughter up so I guess it doesn't matter but it seems poorly thought out.The camera moves very quietly. I can't hear it at all, except through the application. It does make an audible click when switching to/from night vision.The mounting hardware was present and adequate.The camera's firmware offers a great degree of control.I would strongly recommend this camera to friends.I'd also recommend the Tinycam Android ap if you want to view the camera on an Android mobile device.

However the low pricetag on goldbox pushed me to give them another try.  I'm glad I did.  This camera from time to time goes on sale for just under $70.  First of all, the picture is what you'd expect from an IP camera.  While not HD it's quite good.  I watch my cats on my Android phone when I'm out and about.

There were a few key features I was looking for. I wanted the ability to watch from my Android smartphone and from a computer, and I wanted it to connect to my network via WiFi. This camera has these features and a few extras that have come in handy. This camera seems to be very well built, it has already survived a couple of toddler induced incidents. I have the black version, which has almost like a satin rubber finish to it. I think this finish will help to prevent scratches, but time will be the test there.The setup of this camera requires a computer. You can use either Mac or PC for this, I used a Mac. For the initial setup, you need to plug the camera directly into your wireless router. Then you put the included CD in your computer and run the program to locate the IP of the camera. Once you have the IP address, the rest of the setup is done in your browser. This is where you'll join the camera to your wireless network. It was pretty straight-forward for me, but I can understand where some people could get confused. The language used in the setup is very technical and does not offer any explanation of the technical terms. There is plenty of help online if you have any questions about the technical terms and what they mean. I didn't have any problems throughout the setup and I had the camera up and running in about 10 minutes.There is no included Android/iOS app with this camera, but there are hundreds of IP Camera apps that work with it. My wife has been trying the iOS apps out on her iPad and has found there are lots to choose from. Same goes with my Android smartphone, there are literally hundreds of IP camera apps. The browser interface is not flashy, but definitely gets the job done. There is very little lag when viewing on any of my devices, I'd guess less than 1/2 second. I'm pretty impressed with this aspect, I thought it would be a couple seconds behind at a minimum.The night vision feature is incredible on this camera. It is important to note that the IR leds used for night vision will glow a soft visible red light, so it is easy to spot the camera in the dark. The night vision is so good, you'd swear there is a light on in the room. I have noticed that during the daytime, the night vision has trouble deciding when to turn on. But I don't really plan on using this during the daytime, so this does not concern me.The pan/tilt feature is something I didn't think I'd use, but I have used it to track my daughter's movements in her bedroom after converting her crib into a toddler bed. The pan/tilt motor is pretty quiet, but it is audible. The range of motion is very large, much more than I need for a little bedroom.There are a few features that I do not plan on using. You can set up email alerts when motion is detected, as well as upload images so you can see what triggered the motion. You can also record video from the camera to a DVR or FTP, which can also be triggered by motion. Since I'm not using this camera for security purposes, I don't really have any intention on using them. But I can definitely see where they could be useful in other applications.I've had this camera running for about a week and have had no problems so far. I am very pleased with this camera and I'm thinking of getting another to put in my garage for security purposes. If I had to find a fault with the camera, it would be that the web-browser interface is a little clunky and looks like a website from the late 90's. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for an IP camera that can be viewed on a smartphone, tablet, or computer. I can't imagine why anybody would spend more on a camera when this camera appears to have everything most people need.", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Foscam Tech Support #1", "Author": "Vern", "ReviewID": "R1F3M8NFWO0XWZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally bought 4 Foscam F18910W cameras via Amazon Prime for about $80.00 each.

I purchased one of the FI8910W cameras bundled with the Blue Iris software to give it a shot.  Here is what resulted from that initial purchase....  I have since (within a week) purchased two more of the FI8910W cameras and three of the FI8905W outdoor cameras because I was that satisfied! Yes, they are only standard definition, but they fit my budget and give me a substantial peace of mind while in town or out of town (with the Blue Iris software for PC and the app for iphone/iPad).  All I can add is that if you have a tiny bit of tech know how, you can set this up and feel a bit more comfortable knowing that you installed a really good working, reliable, and cost effective means of monitoring your home.

The written manual is correct, Foscam's service is all that you need.I installed this using a Mac and had no problems, but as I mentioned above, you really need to be comfortable changing network and router settings to get through the manual.

Downs \"RED\"", "ReviewID": "R1X76N53TH6AA9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Last week I received a dual pack FOSCAM FI8910W's that I ordered through AMASON.The Foscam FI890W is a wireless (802.11 B/G/N) network camera that is packed with features normallyfound in more expensive IP cameras.It has pan and tilt capabilities which means that instead of having a fixed view in one direction likesome of the other cameras, you can pan and tilt it so that you can see what you need within a 300 degreerange and 120 degree tilt angle.  Minor con here is there is no zoom feature, which would be nice to have,but not a necessity. One other observation is that the motor drive is extremely smooth and quiet.Next, it has night vision provided by a dozen IR LEDs that provide up to 25 feet of night vision. I triedthis and it works quite well and is much better than several other cameras I have worked with in the past.Camera placement is also a factor to consider especially if your neighbor has bright outside lights.It should be noted that the camera has a resolution of 640\u00d7480 which at first I considered a possible con.But I found the picture quality quite good even in full screen mode. The camera appears to employ goodquality optics for this price range.The FI8910W also allows for motion detection, and is very simple to use and setup. It is triggered byanything that moves in the cameras field of vision.  This could be a con for some users as some may wantto select specific areas to monitor motion or set up a higher motion range so that the family dog does nottrigger the device. This can be overcome by using other monitor software such as iSpy.The camera has two-way communication capabilities through a built in microphone and speaker. The soundquality is good from the camera speaker. Con here is when speaking using the built in microphone is very weak.You may want to add a quality microphone or speaker utilizing the built in mic/spkr jacks located on the back ofthe unit to improve sound and voice quality.You can do remote viewing via a web page or an app for your iPhone or Android phone. To test this, I used mySamsung Galaxy Note and a free app called Foscam Remote which worked well. There are many other apps out therethat work as well.For sound, motion or both you may setup the supplied software to send an e-mail alert. It supports sending ane-mail with pictures and IP address of the device which, if clicked on opens your web browser to view devicein real time even on your phone.If you need to view the camera outside your network via a web browser, you will have to setup port forwardingon your router so you can locate the camera via your WAN's IP address. If your WAN does not provide or havea static IP address, I used no-ip.org to track my dynamic IP address because it was free and dyndns.org is nolonger providing free accounts.Set up is easy for someone who has experience with this type of camera to set it up on a network and make itwork outside your network via a web browser. Novice users may find themselves at a slight disadvantage, butshould be able to get up and running by utilizing the provided software and documentation. If not, then there isplenty of documentation and videos located on their website that should be able to help. YouTube has many videos also.The best thing about this camera was the price. You get all of this for less than $200 (double pack).  That's agreat price for a two camera bundle that has so many capabilities.Take a long hard look at the Foscam FI8910W.  It is a very capable camera when compared to other cameras in its pricerange that is relatively easy to set up and use. From a cost and performance standpoint, it may well be hard to beat.I plan to buy several more in the near future to complete my system.", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good.

If you want to record activity from installed cameras, logic says you need to move or copy those recordings \"off premises\" to be reviewed later. Why? Because if your property is being stolen or destroyed, so are the recordings if they are only being stored locally, on premises on a computer in the house or office. Its like any good backup. So an FTP off-site or \"cloud\" is necessary to protect your files. If your just using the cameras to monitor rooms, or family activity, they would be fine.

Much better was when weswitched to the iCam App on iPads and iPhones which displays 4 cameras on one screen which enlarges and controls with a simple finger swipe (up/down, left/right, start record, alert etc) all with full sound. ICam cost wasonly $4.99 (shared by our iPads & iPhones. Suggest using the 192.168.x.x adresses rather than assigned iPadress for setup which allows you to keep the same external IP address for access anywhere in the world evenif there's a camera power loss requiring reset (no reconfiguring required). Love the iCam app that quickly bringsup the 4 cameras with one touch of the finger almost immediately without fiddling with 4 usernames and 4 passwords etc as required in the Foscam software, yet has an added level of access security over the Foscam software. All in all Foscam cameras with Macs and iCam is a great combination, hard to beat!I have 3 other black cameras just like the white one above. Here's my review of them:Excellent camera (have 4), especially using the Apple iCam app on our iPhones and iPads (one-time cost of $4.99 for all devices. sound quality great as well as all controls on iCam with just the swipe of a finger. We run iCamSource on our MacMini which has plenty of horsepower for our 4 cameras, webserver, VOIP telephones as well as pump music to wireless speakers around our home. There are some tips/tricks I discuss in my previous review.  All in all the careras are great and hard to beat and a great combination with iCam/iSource on iPhones-iPads/MacMini. Our configuration with iCam seems much more efficient (perhaps 4x less drain on CPU) than using the FosCam access software on iPhones and iPads, much easier to use (1 touch away) and control (one swipe). ICam also presents images of all 4 cameras on one screen so when you pick 1 of 4 it enlarges that camera to full screen with the sound and allowing full control with a finger swipe (LR-UD), record or alert.", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "happy with the camera", "Author": "Paul T.

explanations) from the companies website, setting it up was a breeze (but having just the slightest insight in how your home network functions will definitely help). over all a really good camera for the price.i have an all mac network, down to the airport extreme. which means its a plus and a minus. it was definitely a good thing when it came to the set up videos. they guy gave brief but thorough explanations and went through set up in more than one type of gateway/router. the downside to using a mac is there is no audio when viewing camera online. however if you use foscams mobile app you get full control of all functions plus the two-way audio feature.  the down side to the app is that it cost $6. as a busy person if you just need to view cam through a mobile device then it is perfect and well worth the price.the only other thing, it's smaller than what i thought. which is a good surprise it sets up anywhere the power cord can reach.*UPDATE* the very next day i caught the exterminator rummaging through our pill cabinet. great quality picture and sensitive microphone. well worth the investment. comparable cameras sell for $250 and up*UPDATE* it's been a few months. and i moved to a different place. the camera has held up good. remembering what i learn about port forwarding from the initial installation, made setting up the camera fairly simple. i moved it from the ceiling to the top of the lampshade on an end table, its so out in the open people hardly ever notice it. i only have the one, but i plan on buying a few more and possibly purchasing the blue iris software to see how the whole system works. the picture is good and microphone isn't the best but for the price it's great.", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera, alright sound", "Author": "Anthony",

The camera supports full pan and tilt, tilting from 12:00 to about 4:00 and I believe it will make a full 360 turn, or close to it.The initial setup is done via ethernet to setup user accounts and network settings.  After adding it to your wifi network, it will always connect when the power is disconnected.The IR lights are powerful enough to see in complete darkness clearly and the automatic sensor will turn them off when there is enough light in the room.  The IR LEDs switching on and off can be a bit loud, especially in twilight conditions while the camera struggles to find the best lighting however this can be turned off.The software also supports user accounts and group security which is nice if you need to grant view only or operator access to someone.I do wish the power cord was a bit longer, roughly 5-6 feet or so.Overall, great security camera or baby monitor, would certainly buy again without hesitation.", "Date": "January 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera and service", "Author": "Marc G", "ReviewID": "R202MZ49R0DL2L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my business to oversee the operations when I'm gone.

Unfortunately, it has too many bugs in my opinion to be ready for prime-time.Firstly, the web interface of Foscam.com does not permit you to download the drivers for the camera. This is highly annoying. You provide your e-mail address, and then you get an e-mail from Foscam with the links to download the drivers. Go to Foscam.com and hit downloads on the right. To make matters even worse, my camera shipped with firmware version \"11.37.2.48.\" This is disappointing to me because after giving my e-mail to them the download link they sent back was for \"11.37.2.46\" -- two iterations the predecessor to what the camera shipped with. That means that they don't update the download links and that the camera is effectively unsupported from the manufacture. I'm suspicious that this is part of the Foscam game: cheap disposable cameras that are primarily changed in just firmware. It doesn't seem like from the reviews there is much of a difference between the 8910W and the 8918W. And, on that note, who seriously decrements the model number when update the model?Foscam marketing, and support: 1.So, why would I care about the firmware anyway? Well, turns out Foscam models have a long standing issue with WPA2 and AES. Not sure why, or what the problem is. It's all closed-source proprietary trash from China, but the problem is there. Just search the internet for \"wpa2 + aes + foscam\".Q/A: 2Now onto what most people care about, if you wire the camera up to a router you'll get pretty good performance and control out of it. The colors are decent and the I/R is pretty reasonable too.Picture quality: 4Still can't recommend this camera.

Granted, I am tech savvy and have a fair amount of experience with networking but I found them very simple to set up. The instructions were, for the most part, well written on a technical level. As long as you pay attention to the details like only using IE for setup you should be fine. I had both of them up and running in about 45 minutes, despite some issues with my own router. As a heads-up, when setting up multiple cameras on a dynamic IP network, you need to assign each one it's own port (like :80, :81, :82) or it won't let you configure the port forwarding in the router.Anyhow, they work like a charm with my Windows 8 phone. Feed is very smooth at full size (640x480) and full frame rate on my LTE connection. On my wife's iPhone 4 on 3G it's a little choppy but also works fine. I haven't tried turning down the resolution/frame rate on hers to see if it makes a difference but I'm guessing it will help.The picture is great overall and I'm very impressed with the night vision quality. The picture is very clear and still shows color if there's some natural light spill in the room. When you are in the room, the night vision LEDs glow a very faint red so the camera's not totally invisible but it's very inconspicuous. The pan/tilt motors are also almost totally silent so when you move the camera you can't hear it unless you're right next to it. If you have these stashed somewhere, they would be very hard to notice by visual or sound cues, especially in the dark. They are a little bit larger than I was expecting and the wall mounts are pretty bulky. They're not going to be easy to hide in plain sight like some smaller cameras but for the features they offer, it's worth it.My only small complaint is that I wish you could tap and hold on an arrow to constantly pan or tilt, rather than have it move in small increments with each tap. It's very accurate but if you need to sweep the room, it takes some time. You can turn on the auto pan and it'll sweep but you don't have control over which way it goes first so it could be faster or not.

I believe this is because the camera does not understand 64 bit packets etc. Eventually I did cotton onto this (after trying dozens of other measures such as no security on the wifi hub) and tried an XP 32 netbook I have. The IP camera tool found the camera and it took 5 mins to get the camera working. You do need to let it reboot when submitting changes and then unplug it so it reboots again but then it does work.

Decided to give this camera (2 of them actually) a try.  They arrived a day earlier than expected (another good job by Amazon!).  The items came with everything you need to get started.  The \"Quick Installation Guide\" was simple and easy to understand.  Start with the unit \"wired\", make the connection with the router, then install the software, and make the connection wirelessly.  I  use MAC filtering for security on my network.  Both the wired and wi-fi MAC addresses are printed on the base of the unit, so... no problem.Wired... They are outstanding.  Image is clear, color is very good, 2 way sound is good as well.  Wireless...  The farther they are from your router, the harder it is for the router to \"detect\" the camera and the less responsive they are to commands (pan, tilt etc), and movement becomes choppy.  (Which is to be expected)  The location of my cameras are in covered animal shelters which are well beyond the far end of our (3000sf) house (opposite side of the house from the router's location).  I was bummed at the choppy performance at that distance.  So before I returned them as not suitable for my application, I thought I'd give something a try.  I purchased a Belkin Dual-Band Range Extender and added it to my home network.  I placed it at the opposite end of my house (closer to the camera's location) and ta-da... they work perfectly!These cameras are wireless b/g/n compatable, and the software allows for the monitoring of up to 9 cameras at a time.  I like that we can access the cameras from our computers and/or smartphones.  The only thing that I don't really like about the software is that it makes you \"Log in\" each time you want to view the cameras.  I want to be able to click an icon on my desktop and view my cameras.  Their configuration has you click their icon, double-click the IP address, click a log-on \"Submit\" button, and one other button before you get to the image itself.  (A bit of an inconvenience)  I guess I could solve this problem by assigning the camera a static IP address that is outside my router's DHCP assignment range, and place a shortcut to that IP on my desktop.Overall, we're pretty happy with the purchase.  They do what they're supposed to do, and that's all we were looking for when we purchased them.  The price was reasonable, and they really help us out.  Like I said at the beginning \"So Far...

It did a great job and I was very pleased with the results. The motion detect was great and the emailed photos I received let me know when my pet sitter came and went. I did not use any audio features, so cannot comment on that.Many reviews here comment on the great features, so I won't repeat them here. I'll restrict my review to some issues I had and general comments about the product.1. I work in IT so setting this unit up on my wireless network was no biggie. However, I can see how someone who doesn't understand (wireless) networking might get confused and frustrated. That said, many reviews comment on how good Foscam's customer/tech support is, so that's good. I didn't need to use it. For a great step-by-step method to setting up, see the review by R.Tickle from March 29, 2012.2. I bought my first unit towards the end of October '12. After 8 or 9 days it dropped off my wireless network. The only way I could get it to re-connect was to reboot the camera AND reboot my wireless router. It would be OK for a day or so, then do it again. Rebooting my wireless router was getting old, so I returned the camera for a replacement. It has worked flawlessly ever since.3. The replacement unit shipped with updated firmware and Foscam had made some changes. One was not for the better. Before, when I clicked IR mode, the camera went into IR mode irrespective of the amount of light. On the replacement unit, it did not. The camera decided for itself whether or not it thought there was enough light to justify IR mode. I find that annoying. To compensate, Foscam increased the range for the brightness setting. For example, at night a distant (20+ feet away) lamp in my living room provided sufficient light to prevent IR mode, even though the majority of that room was dark or in deep shadow. I had to jack up the brightness setting to be able to see the room. The original camera from October switched into IR mode when I told it to irrespective. I preferred that mode of operation.4. Setting up email so you can receive emails when motion is detected is a pain. Foscam are upfront about the fact Hotmail won't work, so I setup a Gmail account specifically for this camera. After a few dozen emails (forwarded to my Hotmail account), everything stopped. No emails! Long story short, Google had decided that the email traffic via the gmail account I'd setup was spam and had suspended the account. Idiots! I setup an Outlook.com email account instead and after fiddling around with the settings, it has worked well ever since. Just be aware that the camera software doesn't tell you if there's an email problem per se. The Test button in the UI only tells you something failed and is invalid if the email account setup is wrong. It doesn't tell you what is wrong, why it is wrong or how to fix it. So expect to spend some time fiddling with this function. That said, there is some good reference material on the Foscam website and on Youtube as well.5. Overall, for the price this is a great IP camera. I'd like to see HTTPS support and a zoom function, but apart from that it's a very good piece of kit.Happy voyeuring!", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "very good and great value", "Author": "Mr M Abery", "ReviewID": "R2UCW56LLONV4R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "read other reviews here for setting up instructions!

Although there were negative reviews, I still bought them because of the features they offered (IR Full Night Vision, Pan/Tilt, 2 Way Audio) and because they were wireless. I use two of them at my vacation home and one at my regular house for surveillance, and though the first set up was confusing, the second and third only took about 15 minutes each. Word of advice, don't use YouTube or customer instructions, I used the pamphlet included and it made it so much easier to set up. (I tried with a YouTube video first and ended up having the factory restart the camera) The image quality is what I would have expected for a camera under $100, not amazing, but clear. I can see up to 20 feet and recognize faces fairly easily. The Pan/Tilt is amazing as it gives you so much more viewing power over what you're looking at (i.e Camera is pointed at front door but can still turn around and see rest of house). Audio is 7/10 with a good amount of clarity, but still some buzzing, however there is a port if you want to add your own microphone. (Only on Internet Explorer Windows Computers with \"Acitive X\" can you listen to audio, unless you use an iPhone App). The speaker in the camera, used to talk to the thing you're looking at it useful but overall just an added feature. You couldn't hear it if you were more than 6 or 7 ft. away. I use my cameras wirelessly, but I would bet that if you used a direct ethernet connection, the speed would be better (there is a 1-2 second lag if you go wirelessly, but not something that should deter you) If your computer is on the same network as the camera, you can use the Application that came on the CD to view your camera (Multiple Camera Viewing on 1 page is only available on Windows Internet Explorer), but once you leave the house, you have to set up Port Forwarding through your router. This is probably the most confusing part of the setup, but I thought the guide explained it well. With port forwarding, and the included web address attached to the bottom of your camera (three years free included), you can view your feed from anywhere in the world and through your smartphone. Do not use No-IP or DynDns, just use the included web address and save yourself the trouble. I personally shelled out the $6 and bought FosCam Pro on the iPhone App store and it was worth it. Not only do you get the audio (I'm a Mac user), but the app also included digital zoom features (not included on the Mac internet applications only PC Internet Explorer).

I also set up port forwarding to a public address, so that I can access the camera when away from home (using appropriate security of course).Device support for this camera is amazing.

Wireless audio lags the entire system by about 2-3 seconds.Wireless video is delayed about 1/2 of a second and is barely noticeable. Wired seems to have very little lag and is practically unnoticeable.Back to the audio. Even cranked up the audio will be VERY low with the built in microphone if you plan to use it as a baby monitor it might not matter too much, but in that aspect it could be improved.Using a separate microphone and going wireless? I cannot say I can recommend this AT ALL as it gives a constant humming sound. I even went as far as removing the antenna and also tilting the antenna to be right above the power-supply cord - it had minimal affect on the noise and therefore cannot recommend this method right out of the box. There are supposedly mods that replace a resistor on it, but as stated before I've not had the time to tinker with it - I just messed with the default settings because of the lack of time.One last thing, the night vision on this camera is really good, however, the red LEDs might be a problem if mounted within sight of a child at night as they are pretty bright and noticeable. Keep that in mind if you plan on using it as a baby monitor.Once I figure it out and what's the best things to use with it I'll update this post (probably sometime within the month - time permitting). So as of right now, with JUST the out of box features and no modifications I can only give it a 4/5. Had the audio worked better it would be a 5/5 without a shadow of a doubt. I am a tinkerer so this review will probably go to 5/5 but with a warning indicating that this was indeed after modding and will include a guide on what I did to fix the audio problem as well as the apps used for mobile devices (I have both an Android Icecream OS and iOS) So I'll post those as well.

They work with \"tinyCam Monitor\" Android app and my wife's iOS app, sound and mic, so that's definitely a plus. Overall I do like them. Gotta say I'm very disappointed with their performance though, 5FPS MAX on wifi. I've got an Amped R20000G wifi router and get 22-25mbit throughput with all cams off over the 2.4ghz link, 19-21mbit with 1 cam on, and 15-18mbit with two cams on, when testing through my phone. My point here is that I have plenty of bandwidth left over and it's definitely not my network. The whole time I'm testing the FPS on the cams stays right at 5FPS. They don't do 5ghz wifi either, only 2.4ghz, but at least it's wireless N and WPA2 compatible. Shame too, get 65mbit throughput easily from my phone.Despite their shortcomings in the performance category, the picture is crisp enough I can recognize peoples facing and such at a good 20-30 feet. And for the price, half off if your smart and choose amazon warehouse deals, is pretty dang good for the compatibility and use. I wanted to give them 4 stars, but for the price, compatibility, and my usage I wouldn't be able to find anything better. So 5 stars it is.*Update 01/05/2012*I did a lot of tweaking on my wifi and found that the 40mhz spread setting cuts the framerate by about 60%, which is odd cause it should have the opposite effect. The total bandwidth decreases but I guess the cams just aren't compatible with the signal. I dropped it to 20mhz and on wifi my cam's are getting 11fps each, pretty dang happy with that.

Most device manufacturers do not charge you to get your device fixed.  Not so with FOSCAM.  They sent me an RMA message that failed to tell me where to send the returned device, as if they had never done that before.  Then note I had to pay to ship the failed device, which they verified in a tech support contact was not recoverable and WAS within warranty, so it was not like I was just sending them an unexpected failed device.  I got on-line with them and for an hour or so went through all the steps they required to determine the device was bad.  Then when I sent them the device, the email acknowledging they received it told me I had to pay a $7.00 fee to get my replacement.I will argue that is bad policy and a worse business model.  But regardless, their tech support did not let me know of that charge ahead of time.

Needless to say I didn't go with pro install when I moved because the camera quality on those doesn't have anything on the Foscam. If you put the professional cameras and the Foscam side by side you would always pick the Foscam image thinking it must be the more expensive of the two.Setup was easy, took all of five minutes via WiFi. The picture clarity is amazing and the IR night function gives almost the same clarity as if it were daytime. Tilt/Zoom is great and there really isn't anywhere you can't see, pretty much no blind spots.I can pull up and use all pan/tilt/record/snapshot from anywhere I am and have the FoscamPro app installed on my iPad,iPhone, and android devices.Since they don't use a central receiver (they go off of wifi or hard wired) the range is as far as your home network extends which makes them even more dynamic. I currently have three up and running.I found a very easy way to monitor these (if you don't want to keep it on your computer or device)-I used the Logitech Revue, hooked it up to a small tv and now I have a central 24/7 Security monitoring screen.These cameras really couldn't be any easier to set up/manage and monitor than they already are.I have tried seven different brands and many cameras and none come close to the Foscam.I suggest you try Foscam, if you don't like it send back , that simple. But I have a feeling if you have ever tried any other home cameras you will not only keep it but buy several more.For the quality of images, quality of product itself, features and price- You can't go wrong.I buy over 400 items a year from Amazon and always give an honest review in order to help those trying to make a purchase decision.This product rates 5 stars for use-ability, construction and price.", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "D.

I've rooted my last two android phones, rooted my HP Touchpad, and I've even got my router hacked to run a different firmware. So setting up all the port-forwarding and other stuff to get the video set up wasn't too rough. The problem I've been having is with the audio.I've bought two apps on my phone that allow audio functionality (the free versions don't have audio, so they make you pony up if you want it). They both worked flawlessly out of the box. All I had to do was type in my IP address and port, and I was good to go. However, getting it up and running on my Windows 7 64-bit box has been a whole other story.I've tried Google Chrome (my main browser), which requires the installation of a VLC plug-in. I use VLC as my media player already, so I was optimistic. This function is EXTREMELY buggy, to say the least. The audio will work, but only at full volume. There's a volume control on the plug-in, but as soon as you adjust it, the audio completely cuts out until you reload the page. Furthermore, after you adjust the volume, the volume control disappears from the screen!! The electronic hum that comes through the speaker is so loud that I have to turn my computer speakers down from 50% to about 5%. But that means using your computer for any other audio stuff is completely impossible. I watch videos, and constantly listen to music on my computer, so this won't work.I've tried Firefox, which also requires the VLC plug-in. With Firefox, I can get either audio or video, but not both. Furthermore, the same volume problem exists here too as with Chrome.I've tried Internet Explorer, which Foscam recommends. They indicate that you can only use a 32-bit version of Internet Explorer. Fine. They have a whole bunch of ActiveX security controls that you have to tweak. Fine. There are some Windows Volume settings that you have to enable. Fine. I did all of these, but still couldn't get the audio to work. I uninstalled IE 9 and tried using IE 8. Tweaked all the various settings again, but still no audio.I bought the thing so I could use it as a baby monitor, but with lots of friends having babies soon, I'm going to tell them to steer clear of this.", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Quality of these cameras NOT improving.", "Author": "Amazon Fan", "ReviewID": "R3G52FJZ6J34P0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Pros:  Good Price, fulfilled extremely fast.Cons:  The feature to set/recall presets does not work even after performing the RESET procedure.

The night vision with IR lights works great at night and in dark rooms.In the more advanced set up, you can set it so it will email you a series of pictures if movement is detected.I do plan on purchasing at least one more for another part of the house when the price drops again and I am also looking at installing another Foscam branded camera outside to keep an eye on the front door.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Technical Support", "Author": "Casey Baker", "ReviewID": "R38KARSPDOCNER", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Camera works excellent, facing  difficulty accessing the camera remotely, contacted technical support, they helped me through, i'm satisfied with the support and the camera would recommend the camera to others.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Foscam F18910w", "Author": "Chester Espinoza JR.", "ReviewID": "RUKKEHMYWP2ZQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Camera has very good customer service. set up with customer service was very fast and easy.Use the camera for our retail store and have set it up to record and alarm us through email.Very happy with system and service.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Product, Easy to Install", "Author": "Frank H.

The mounting bracket allows easy placement and I've actually retrofit mine with magnets so that I can stick it to any metal drywall corner in the house without drilling any holes.  The remote access works well too, although you have to be patient with the pan/tilt controls as there is a lag.

The IR is outstanding, and turns a completely dark room into a room that is well illuminated on video, with only the dim red glow of the LED's which is barely noticeable.I downloaded free software, Camera Viewer Pro, which will run in the background of my computer and records video (constantly or motion detected) to the hard drive.

The hardware is a breeze to setup but adjusting the wireless network/port forwarding and such is somewhat difficult if you do not know what port forwarding is. There are step by step video guides on foscam's main website to help ease the software setup. One problem I had was trying to view the camera through Internet Explorer. There was a problem with ActiveX not being able to download, but had that fixed from googling for troubleshoot guides online. This may not be the case for you but it can happen. Overall, I am happy with the camera for now.. So here is a list of what the camera provides, from what I can remember.Features:-Theres an android app to view your camera from anywhere-Pan/tilt from a click of your mouse (view distance is almost 360)-Record function(Voice is recordable but the mic is not that great. Based on using the cameras program, you need to leave your computer on and you can only record when you view the camera through Internet Explorer. For some reason Internet Explorer have a few more options to mess with than running the camera through Chrome/Firefox/etc)-IR bright enough-Motion detector (Theres a Email function to send you photos/videos when triggered - You can also set the amount of secs the camera will record once the motion detector is triggered. There is also another function where the camera will save the video to a specific location in your computer once the motion detector is triggered)-Horizontal/Vertical patrol (You are able to set how long the camera will pan left/right and tilt up/down throughout the whole time camera is active)-Flip/Mirror-Brightness/Contrast-Able to set multiple users to view camera-Audio (not that great though, there is an in/output on the back of the camera where you can place a better mic/speaker I am assuming, have not tried it though)-Speaker (You can speak in to your computer's mic and hear it on the camera. Only works when you run the camera program through Internet Explorer)-Third party programs to run the camera (I have not tried this but you may have to pay for some of them after a trial, the programs are listed on their main website)I am going to purchase another and add on to this another review if any problems come up.Good luck with your purchases!", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "A great little camera", "Author": "West Coast Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R3IYVXO378RMOO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am new to the iPhone and a friend's comments about how he could monitor his house from his phone initiated my interest about this product.  I was nervous at first given some the reviewer comments about how difficult this can be to set up.  While I consider myself quite good with computers, I quickly develop a thousand yard stare when people start getting too far in to networks or router settings.  Despite the misgivings I ordered this model and it arrived in good order.  It took me about 15 minutes to be able to view it on my computer (within my own network).  Viewing it remotely on the Internet and my phone took about another 45 minutes.  Most of that time was wasted on trying to remember how to get back in to my router settings.  Once I got in to the settings, everything else was pretty much a breeze (despite having a less than desirable dynamic IP).  The two way audio didn't work right initially.  I could monitor the audio in the room but nobody could hear me on the other end.  This issue sort of just fixed itself after restarting my phone and rebooting the camera.No, I'm not a Foscam employee giving a fake 5 star review, as one previous reviewer claimed all five star raters were.  The video quality is a bit fuzzier than I expected, there's no zoom function, and the internal speaker for the two way audio stinks because the volume is so low.  If there is anyone talking in the room or a television is on, don't expect them to be able to hear you.  Despite that I'm still willing to give it a 5 star rating because it's a heck of a lot of \"bang for the buck.\"  If I wanted something that was perfect I'd probably have had to spend a lot more money so I can't complain.  My recommendations for set up are to simply follow the instructions line by line.  That's what I did and outside of the audio problem at the beginning, it worked fine.  I definitely recommend this if you've got some decent computer proficiency.  If you've never opened your router settings before or don't understand IP settings, I can easily see someone spending hours banging their head against the wall trying to get it to work.

This is not a web cam that you will easily hide and you need to think along the lines of disguising it's profile somehow.The cameras performance is very good and pans and tilts to the software commands very well.You can also listen to sound in it's vicinity and it has a small speaker in which you can speak through, although the level of sound is quite low.I downloaded and installed IP Cam Viewer Pro by Robert Chou both on my Ipad and also on my Android Nook. This is the icing on the cake as the software enables you to control the Web Cam very well and i highly recommend it.The price has gone up $10 since I purchased the web cam which is rather annoying as I was considering purchasing another but will wait until they are on sale.Overall a good purchase and allows us the ability to view our home when we are away and also to get email alarms if we arm the motion sensing. There is also the ability to take a snapshot and record video too. Just bear in mind this is a web cam and not a professional high quality surveillance camera.

There seems to be some mechanical piece in there that changes around when things go dark to allow the camera to see in IR. My camera worked fine for about a week then stopped responding to the light in the room, permanently staying in \"day\" mode. I could manually switch it if I went into the software but that was about it. I went online in hopes of solving my own problem but found many people were having the same issue. It would appear this is a factory defect and not some sort of user error. I contacted Foscam's tech support and got the usual power cycle talk but that didn't fix anything.

Very few and simple changes to router and camera to make it reliable i.e static lan ip, take lan ip out of pool, have camera email you new wan if it changes. Infrared shuts off when lights come on. Remote control from phone. May step up to the paid app which adds audio down the road. Cool toy for me to tinker with and learn.Update 1: Just be forewarned that the audio is distorted and pretty much unusable. Still not a show stopper for me but figured I'd pass this on for someone using it as a baby monitor. I had the same issue on a $125 cisco/linksys ip camera i tried a year or 2 ago. Heard it could be several causes which i'll investigate but even if it doesn't work i'll still keep it. Heard i may not have this issue using the android app but you have to pay for that feature. Report back if I discover a fix.Update 2:Thanks for the heads up on the audio. I just discovered the same thing this morning - \"enable and disable the mic like a walkie talkie\". Think it's probably software related. Maybe why they sell the blue iris software as an accessory. See if I can find some reports about if using the blue iris software eliminates the problem. You saved me some time by testing with external mics and speakers. Thank You. Have not tried the audio on my phone yet as it would require me to pay for the app - IP Cam viewer by Robert Chou. Please report back if you come up with a solution and I'll do the same.Posted the above comment to another reviewer who delved deeper. Appears all is not lost for the audio. May take this into the discussion section. I tested this morning from my pc at work. The camera is right next to my pc at home so I think that is why i have more issues at home with feedback.", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Incomplete instructions, but fantastic camera once it's set up", "Author": "Ed B.", "ReviewID": "R2AJI810Z7Y9YY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ran into the same WIFI problems that most reviewers seem to have had here. But after doing some searching online i found what was causing me the headache. The camera would show up on my LAN when being plugged in with the ethernet cable, but would not show up once i switched to wifi mode. I was using MAC id protection on my router and i enabled the MAC id that the setup tool showed me. However this is NOT the MAC id you should use in your wifi router settings. Instead look at the small sticker at the bottom of the camera. There are two stickers with each a different MAC id. Use the smallest one that differs from the one you see in the setup tool. It's actually so small that you might even need a magnifying glass... But it instantly solved my problem once i used this MAC id in my router settings. The camera showed up on my wifi LAN and worked perfectly right after that.However I can understand that people that don't have a basic knowledge of setting up a router might have a bit of a hard time getting wifi to work. I was annoyed too that i couldn't figure it out although i have plenty of experience and was convinced that i wasn't doing anything wrong. Too bad it's not made more clear that you need the second small MAC id that you can only find on the bottom of the camera. Unless i overlooked that part in the manual. It's actually so small that i didn't even notice it at first.Anyway, the camera's image is super crisp and clear. It even has a small manual focus ring on the front to adjust it if your subject might be a bit out of focus. It's great to have the audio/mic option as well, it's a bit hard to hear but at least it let's you hook up external mic or speakers if you wish to. The viewing angle of the lens is nice wide and the pan and tilt range is great as well. The default antenna has good reception. I can put the camera several rooms away or even a floor down from where my router is and still there is no drop in signal or image quality. I was expecting a lot of interference problems due to the large amount of different WIFI networks around my house, but this is not causing any problems as long you make sure you're router is broadcasting on a different channel than the other networks.I managed to set things up to work with my (Apple Mac) computer, iPad and android phone. So far i'm using the \"IP Cam Viewer\" app.I set up the camera for remote access through a dyndns service so i can always find the camera when i'm away from home.It's great to see a wall mount plus screws are included as well. I thought i would have to order a seperate mount kit but i was surprised that it was included although it wasn't mentioned anywhere as far as i know. the only problem was that the CD-ROM with the installation software was broken (inside a undamaged box... go figure...) But the setup tool can be downloaded from the Foscam site so that wasn't a big deal for me.Overall i must say i am really happy with this camera and the features that it offers for a really affordable price. I would recommend this product to everyone that has some basic knowledge of setting up a WIFI LAN and wireless devices. You can't beat the value of this product. I don't know if a lot of positive reviews on Amazon are fake, but i can guarantee you that i am not affiliated with Foscam in any way and i believe this is a great product! I will probably order another one soon. But first i need to dig a little bit deeper in the motion detection, email and FTP features that this camera offers.

Not for critical applications, but for monitoring a grandmother or baby - it's great! I am using two of these cameras right now.SetupNot easy to set the camera up to the WiFi and get all the settings right. Honestly I don't think ANY WiFi camera would be easy given all that you ask it, but don't think it will be easy for the novice. I wanted to access the camera from the open internet so needed to fix it's IP address and do some Port Mapping with my router - don't know what that means? Not the fault of the camera, it's just complicated and the software of the camera doesn't help. Once it is set up, it seems stable.Ease of UseThe camera has a built in web interface. Really bad and simplistic. I think another reviewer said it was made in 1989. Probably right ;) HOWEVER, I access it with an iPad app (Foscan Pro: Two Way Audio and Recording) and it is great! Has motion sensing, control, audio, etc. The app is not great, but better than the other ones I have tried. That plus the camera and I've got a system that we use 24/7 with two or more cameras. Sort of (read about stability).StabilityOne reason I don't think the Foscam is for professional monitoring is that it gets lost every-so-often. It acts like it goes through a reset and a boot up. So if you are in the room and watching or listening to the motion sensing, then you will catch it and re-aim it. If not, you come back and the camera is staring at the ceiling.I have one camera that takes it one step further and crashes. It crashes about once a day - no response at all and I need to go and unplug and replug it in to get it back to normal. The warrantee claims two years and I am going to send it back for a replacement - but when you go to the Foscam website they offer no support if you didn't buy it from them - correction, the Foscam website was also built in 1989 and by folks that don't know about customer service, so maybe you can get help - I gave up.Amazon has issues me an RMA so I will be a happy camper.All-in-all I would buy again.

It was a piece of cake to set up; only took me about about 15 minutes. I'm not a computer genius but I'm no dummy either. I installed the camera program (from the included disk) on my laptop and then downloaded an app to my iPad. (In the App Store I searched \"foscam\" and several baby monitor apps were available.) I put the camera right above the top of my son's crib. The camera captures the entire crib space and gives a nice, clear picture. The night vision is also perfectly clear. The color quality is good. When viewing on my iPad, I can see my 5 month old son's back rising and falling as he breathes (sleeps on his tummy).I have not tried to do the remote/internet viewing but would like to try that soon. I'm afraid it will be difficult to do.The only drawback is the power cord to the camera is too short (I just use a small extension cord). There is no zoom either, but you definitely don't need it if you are using it as a baby monitor. If you could spend $10 more and get one with zoom and maybe more megapixels then I would do it.Fantastic camera for a baby monitor.

So this camera can't be hidden4. No option to turn the IR LEDs and keep the IR filter off.5. Software glitches, Admin password couldn't be changed and static IP address couldn't be usedIn detail:1. There is no auto focus on this camera, so maybe I have to manually screw the lens to focus on objects further than 25 feet.  But if something comes closes then it will be out of focus again, so why bother.  Or maybe the camera is low quality.  It does state .3 mega pixels on the camera lens.2. While you can't record without IE, you can set the camera to send 6 images to your email if it senses motion.3. The IR LEDs work great!!!  But they're visible and I'm trying to be sneaky and catch someone who keeps letting their dog shit on my yard at night.  IR (infrared light) is suppose to be invisible to the naked eye.4. The camera has a light sensor that turns the IR LEDs and disengages the IR filter.  For your info, IR filters need to be removed for \"night vision\" to work.  Cameras come with IR filters to block out IR light which ruin color photos and videos.  In fact most cameras can be turned into night vision cameras by opening them up and removing the IR filter.  If you turn the IR LEDs off, the camera thinks it's daylight and engages the IR filter, preventing from working at night. You can put tape over the LEDs, but I have my camera behind tint, and the IR LEDs still managed to \"leak\" and cause a reflection off the tint in recorded video (not to the naked eye though).  So I had to take the camera apart and remove the LEDs and unplug the IR filter actuator.5. When I change the Admin password, I can never log back into my camera.

I strongly recommend this product to anyone looking for an affordable IP web camera. If you encounter any issues with the setup, don't get discouraged, call or e-mail the foscam tech support team and they will help you out.

Setting up the remote access is ridiculously long process and dosen't particularly work. After several attempts at entering my username and password that I just created I wasn't granted access, again.

Previously, I had considered some of the relatively pricey multi-cam DVR systems, but after reading some reviews I opted to try a single Foscam FI8910W. Although I was originally looking for a couple decent outdoor IP cams to view the front and back yard, I was able to snag this new model camera for $75+free shipping brand new directly through Foscam via online auction. For the price I paid, I'd say its definitely worth the money. Is it worth $100? I'll leave that up to you to decide.From the time I unboxed the camera, it took maybe two minutes tops to install the software and have the camera fully operational on my home network via ethernet. From that point, it took another 15 minutes to configure the camera for remote access and have it completely accesible from anywhere in the world with an internet connection. (This process included: creating an account for the host name to be associated with the IP address, configuring my router to forward the necessary port the camera would use, and setting the motion detection alarm, email notification and ftp upload settings within the cam's UI)I'm not an 'IT enthusiast' by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm not a complete moron either :) Regarding the setup, everything was a breeze. I didn't even bother looking at the instructions as the majority of reviews indicated that they were of no help anyway. If you're interested in an IP camera and intend to install it yourself, its wise to have at least a basic understanding of what IP is and how it works so that you can work your way through the setup in a logical fashion. Assuming most people will purchase this camera for its remote viewing capability, its crucial that you understand how to get it setup to take advantage of all its features.The pros:---------Easy setupIP (beats running wires everywhere)Remote accessUser-friendly UIPan/Tilt featureHorizontal/Vertical patrol featureDecent image qualityDecent IR qualityMotion detection/email notifcation/ftp image upload features2 way audioThe cons:---------Audio quality could be betterCamera firmware/UI could be a little more feature-rich and modernized(but this can be enhanced and updated at a later time)Personally, I would like to see some more alarm/alert features built into future firmware/UI updates.I would really love to have this camera mountable outside, but its not recommended as it would likely fail after a short while of being exposed to the elements. (The enclosures were a good thought, but isn't functional with the IR as it reflects off the glass and blinds the camera at night)Its a shame, the outdoor IP cams don't get as good of reviews as these indoor models :(When I'm on the go, I frequently find myself pulling up the video feed on my phone to check in on things.While I'm at work, I've got a window pulled up on my computer so I can keep watch(I frequently pan/tilt the cam just because its kinda fun) :-pThen when I'm home and in a different part of the house, I have it pulled up on myiPad and watching the doors.All in all, great little camera with some cool features for the money.

Mounting the holding bracket was fast (two screws) and with the vertical flip option, we chose the upper corner and did an upside down installation. This gives us much more coverage and viewing angle of the whole room, so we can even see the baby and follow him around when he's playing outside the crib.Image quality decent, it gives 320x240 and 640x480 resolution, which is enough to be used as a monitor. The management section of the Real-Time Camera Monitoring System offers many more options than what we need so I can't comment on those characteristics.The night vision capabilities and quality of IR are nothing short of AMAZING (I realized this as in the monitor the image was incredibly clear and lit, but when I stepped into the room it was completely pitch dark, I couldn't see my own hands). The IR light do make a clicking sound when they come on or off, but nothing that would be disturbing. We have the camera connected with Ethernet cable (we tried the wireless option and worked great also) but on the flip side for us, the connectivity lights behind the base unit create little distraction at night for the baby.

I didn't have to contact tech support over it, but I'm fairly tech savvy and know how my router operates. If I can offer two suggestions that may or may not work for every router:1. Change the camera's default port. It defaults to 80, which is the standard HTTP port used for websites. For some reason, no matter how much I worked at it, my router would not accept inbound connections on port 80 to the camera. I changed it to a random port, and it works fine. This can be done under the \"Basic Network Settings\" menu. That leads me to the next point...2. Enable UPnP in the camera settings.

The camera works well once all hurdles have been overcome. It is not easy as it seems that the instructions were translated from chinese to maybe german and finally english. They are not crystal clear.The included software CD will install the \"IP Camera Tool\". This helps you locate the camera on your local network (LAN).Before double-clicking on your \"discovered\" camera, if you are using Internet Explorer, you will need to go into the internet tools section of IE and enable \"download and run unsigned active X\". If you are using IE, the camera has to install an unsigned active X to run correctly. This is the first real pain as there are about three locations in tools that have to be enabled before IE will allow this active X to be installed. Double click the camera location in the IP camera tool, and the camera will install the active X and then you will be looking at the camera's log in page. I made a short cut in favorites to get to this page. Log in information is actually in the instructions. At this point you will be able to use the camera on your LAN.To make it available on the world wide web, it is necessary to enable port forwarding in the router. My router and modem are all-in-one device supplied by ISP. The camera ships with port 80 enabled. Called tech support at ISP and they walked me through setting up port forwarding in the router. Once that has been accomplished, you can access the camera via the wide area network IP of your modem. Problem is this IP changes every day so I signed up with DynDNS.org to keep track of this constantly (dynamic) changing WAN IP. DynDns actually had software built into my modem/router that enabled DynDns to track the IP and link it to a web address. Now I just go to the web address and it takes me to the log in page of the camera. This is the best tutorial I found is the DNS wizard at DynDns.org.The active X thing was the most difficult to solve as there are I think three diffent boxes that have to be enabled in the security section/custom settings of Tools/Internet Options/ in XP version of IE8. Reviewing the downloaded PDF instructions from Foscam, section 4.1.3 outlines setting up IE to accept the active X. Once that was solved, everything else was accomplished with the software that resides in the router. (port forwarding) and (dynamic DNS) I have not tried the sound yet. Picture is good. Camera IR reflects off of window at night and blinds the camera. Controls take a little practice but work fine. Presets work well to.

I have a lot of cameras around my house and they are by far the best. We aren't paranoid and mostly use them for checking in on the pets & kids. My husband works out of town pretty often and he uses it as a fun way to stay connected to the homefront & peek in on what his family is up to. It makes him feel like he's closer to home. :)The picture is clear & pretty crisp, colors are true, and they seem to be built really well. Pan/Tilt is almost silent & very smooth. (Note: In the UI the P/T speed is faster when the number is lower.) When it's pointed to a bright window it adjusts the lighting so the picture isn't distorted by it. There is a bit more of a fisheye effect on these cameras than the other cams I have, but the quality and true color more than make up for it. The IR view is as good as any of my other cams and is acceptable.The UI is easy to use and it took me 15 minutes to have two cameras set up & viewable remotely. I am in IT support and have a pretty robust network in my home, so am used to working with webcams & remote viewing setup. If you're new to this sort of thing, plan on it taking longer and enjoy learning something new! I can't speak for the iPhone app since I use LiveCams Pro for remote viewing. I have so many different brands & types of cameras that I prefer to just use one app. I highly recommend the LiveCams app, it's loaded with features and you can adjust a lot of your camera settings directly from the app.*** As with every other webcam on the planet, you must know how to find open ports & forward them on your router (or know someone who does) if you want to view your cams remotely. Many cams get bad reviews due to this, and it's not the fault of the cam or manufacturer. You will not be able to view any cam of any brand remotely without taking this step! If your internet provider changes your IP address, you will have to make some adjustments on your remote viewer to access them again. If you can view your camera locally, then there's nothing wrong with it and something just isn't set up right for remote viewing. Think of it as needing to know the address of a house and having the correct key to unlock the door, you can't get in until you have the right combination! :) ***", "Date": "August 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Wireless Camera", "Author": "MC \"MC\"", "ReviewID": "R2TX9TNYZ093GE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price a great camera.

After about a week of back-and-forths, during which they asked for descriptions and pictures of the damage, they informed me that even though I bought it through Amazon it was through an unauthorized retailer, so they couldn't do anything.So, I spent almost $100 on a camera that lasted six months.

I will definitely update on longevity or other issues down the road.Setup -- The instructions flat out did not get me there. My primary problem is that when you go to the device status page it is only showing the MAC address for the wired ethernet, which it is also calling the \"Device ID\" and that is a separate issue. I was doing wireless MAC filtering and so I had entered this into my whitelist and it was not the MAC address of the wireless card, thus it never connected. I had to shut off the filter, connect to the router wirelessly, get the wireless MAC from the router, then add that into my filter list, then turn the filter list back on. The only other setup I did was to get the email up and running. That is pretty straightforward if you've ever done it before. I use gmail and it worked a treat with no problems. I also used upnp (easy mode) for the port mapping, doing it \"the hard way\" is probably outside most users experience. That took me maybe 30 minutes of futzing around to get done. Not horrible but I've done better. I also have extensive networking experience, I'm a programmer, and in general a super geek so your mileage may vary.Features -- Love it. I'm coming from using an old logitech quickcam pro 4000 which is still working but I really needed the new features for the area I'm trying to cover. The picture on full resolution is nice and clear, I could easily make a facial ID from it. The ability of the cam to go through a power outage and recover while my computer remains down is a BIG plus. That removes the middleman and a point of failure. I went ahead and splurged and bought the iPhone app FoscamPro almost immediately. It's the more expensive one of the selection but its without a doubt better. It lets me stand and monitor my house with video and sound and the controls are nice on it. Plus I can make a recording and take pictures straight to my phone so no one can just steal the camera and other stuff and leave no evidence (the motion detection takes care of this immediately but I might want to just get in there and manually control the camera).Conclusion -- I had expected some mega battle due to all the bad stuff out there. I'm aware they are padding the positive reviews, either directly or by proxy. If they really are getting all those customers to come in and add good reviews then one thing is certain; they must be providing quality service after purchase. The manual needs to be rewritten, the wireless MAC needs to display on the status page, all the MAC addresses should be labeled as such instead of \"Device ID\".

What is offered is pretty rough.  - The JPEG files generated by the camera do NOT play well with the PHP GD library.  I'm unable to generate thumbnail images on the fly because GD complains that the image is not a valid JPEG.  -  There really ought to be an API that would allow you to write your own applications for the camera.  There's already an unexposed API to some degree, but an exposed and published on would be cool.  - Like many other reviewers here, I find the casing light.  I have this camera outside, although it's under the roof of one of my outbuildings.  We'll see how it holds up.  - Alerts should allow for more granular control.  - Wireless works, but the wireless scan didn't pick up the LAN.  Further, wireless should support more security protocols.  - The default alert sensitivity of '10' will almost never be suitable.

I am the owner of a Samsung security DVR system with 8 cameras and I have an HD webcam set up in the house to watch our puppy. Both of these systems have remote admin and viewing set up so I have lived the torture of seting up port fowarding, Wifi and firewall changes, powerline network adaptors and a slew of other technical hurdles the marketing people don't mention when you look at these things.  The FOSCAM wasn't the largest learning curve but it did provide a few WTH? moments.The FOSCAM .US website is pretty good with tutorials and the forums make up for some of the particulars of unique routers that the tutorials leave out.  I have AT&T; Uverse and it presents its own odd requirements when setting up port forwarding but I was able to find others that had already solved or at least asked the same questions.  You will need an open ethernet port to set this baby up, and you might be forced to change the Wifi security settings in order to get it to work wirelessly.  An above average understanding of networking will help (a lot) especially if you don't want to open up your wireless network completely.  One thing to mention here - the FOSCAM has a MAC address for its wired connection and another one for its wireless connection.  This alone caused me about an hour of head scratching before I found that nugget of information in the forums.The software the unit comes with does an adequate job and includes some advanced features for security such as motion detection, image capture, notification/alerts and FTP upload of stills.  If you want to see and manipulate the camera via your smart phone there are dozens of apps for both the iPhone and Android systems, even a couple free ones.  I use IPCam Viewer and have all my systems viewable from one app.  The camera has a pretty good speaker and microphone for two way communication but Ive found when using cell data the transmissions are garbled.  If Im within Wifi coverage you can make out about 75% of what is said - maybe 1 word out of 50 though with 3G cell data.Helpful hint for motion alerts: you can normally use an email address to text your phone, I have AT&T; and an iPhone so I would enter my 10 digit phone number followed by @ txt.att.net and when the system detects movement I will get a text message (not email) telling me so.The night characteristics of this camera are OUTSTANDING.  I'll upload a couple pictures with and without the IR illuminator to demonstrate.One big negative; the camera appears to freeze every so often.  Ive read from many people that it's a wifi issue with the camera itself.  It's a temporary thing, lasting maybe 3-5 seconds then the live picture comes back.  Ive begun to experiment with placement and changing wifi channels but so far nothing appears to fix it.  I might try an Apple Airport Express setup up and attach the FOSCAM to the Express via Cat5 just to see if the radio in the FOSCAM is the culprit.  If so the system might go back...  I don't want to use a $100 Apple device to fix a $95 wireless camera.I do recommend this camera.  Having purchased several other cams this is the only one that has so many desired features and a support community to help figure out your unique setup.

Pictures are sharp enough at 640x480 and has full motion Video with sound. The basic Software in the Camera provides good functionality with remote access from any web Browser.  The Camera's internal Setup is menu driven and allows you to set the network connections, move the camera, turn on Auto-motion Detection, shoot 5 pictures and then upload them to your email automatically.I also purchased \"Foscam Pro\" for my iPhone for immediate accesswith full functionality. It looks great on my iPad with the larger screen.  We use the two-way audio to hear and announce something like: \"Hello - This is the Security Office. Please identify yourself.\"  We get peace of mind with no monthly fees from a security company.The installation procedure is a bit complex as noted in other reviews. Fortunately the setup can be mastered by following the online guides. Three of them and each is pretty good. One Lesson for each of the major steps. First, you plug the Camera into your Network to run Setup.  Second, you add your wireless IP Address so you can unplug your network cable. Third, you setup the advanced features for email alerts, network settings, port forwarding, which are optional features.  Each of the 3 Segments has instructions on their US website.  They even did one better by posting separate Network install procedures for 10 of the top Routers making it easy for most computer novices to complete.  Plus, their Phone Support guys are great.  My call back time was about 30 minutes later.  They can easily help with any remote setup problems over the phone on their 1-800 number.Watch a good video introduction on YouTube from the AckwardHampster.Just search for: \"Foscam 8910 Setup\" or \"AckwardHampster\"Cheers and good luck mate.

It took me 20 minutes to get it setup and connected to the wireless.  There are alot of negative reviews, most are because people do not know how to open up their household router/firewall to gain external access.  These complaints should not be directed toward this product as it is their firewall that is doing what it's supposed to do.  This is like not knowing how to drive and blaming a car manufacturer.  The instructions do include how to configure port forwarding in your firewall, however, there are hundreds of different router/firewall devices out there.

I emailed the technical team several times with the issue. I found that respond from the technical team was very slow, Foscam took on average 2 weeks respond back each time I emailed them. Foscam do NOT have a UK technical support, and therefore I had to call the US for any support (rather expensive), when I did call the US I kept getting the message 'you are in the queue', and kept me hanging on for ages. Today (11/07/2012) I got through to the Technical team in the US via telephone and spoke to Ralph Mendez, the technical support agent, who was very good and has now got my camera working via wireless. So in summary, for technical support when I got through to Foscam the service is very good, however via email it is very poor.In terms of the camera, one of the downfall I see is that the viewing angle is very narrow and secondly, on a sunny day the images come out white, because of the infra red.", "Date": "July 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ip camera", "Author": "Eddie Molina", "ReviewID": "R3B334O7V7VB7W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Issue: I was having trouble in doing the port forwarding for my camera.
