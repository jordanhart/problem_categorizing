Being constantly on, and trying to correct every drive error, will burn out a regular computer-type drive. Once you buy the right kind of drive in 3 months, you've paid more. Check the cost of a Western Digital AV-GP or Seagate Pipeline drive. Doubles the cost.", "Date": "May 12, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$141.26", "Features": "New - Retail\n1-Year Warranty\nZmodo PKD-DK0863-NHD\nZmodo PKD-DK0863-NHD 8 CH H.264 Surveillance DVR 4x Outdoor Night Vision Cameras w/ Bracket 4x Cable ***No Hard Drive ***", "Name": "Zmodo PKD-DK0863-NHD 8 CH H.264 Surveillance DVR 4x Outdoor Night Vision Cameras w/ Bracket 4x Cable ***No Hard Drive ***", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41IiLwZP6-L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0080REQ50"}}
