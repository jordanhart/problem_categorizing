{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Just satisfactory Chinese engineering. Card can cause problems.", "Author": "Steely Blue", "ReviewID": "R1E5HWKAN7GE11", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As of Feb. 2014, I have used this device in my car for over two months.Firstly, there is little reason to buy this recorder from a seller at the high price of $339.95 when you get it for much less on the auction site bebay. In particular, I got it for $179 total from the seller e-prance. If you do the latter, it doesn't necessarily have to be shipped from abroad, as there are US based sellers there as well. If, however, you had it shipped from China, Hong Kong, or Taiwan, be aware that it can take several up to weeks for it to be delivered to the US by China Post. In this case, be patient and follow up with the seller if necessary. China Post packages can eventually be tracked on the USPS website, but only after USPS has received information about them.I got this model because it is one of the latest and greatest DOD camera models as of November 2013. In retrospect, its GPS feature can be counterproductive in the event of a collision if you were going too fast, irrespective of who's fault it was. No worries - the geo-coordinate labeling and also the speed labeling can both be disabled, as I chose to do. If you choose to leave them enabled, the coordinates and speed will be displayed on the recorded video for your insurance company, the court and everyone to see.It comes with speed noted in KPH, but of course there exists an MPH option. The max available loop time is 5 minutes. As is desired, the recording starts automatically upon power-on, and stops automatically a few seconds after power-off. Also as desired, there is no recording gap between files. In fact, there is approximately a one second overlap at the start.To test automatic recording at home, connect the device with its USB cable to a USB Wall Charger (USB AC Adapter) such as http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008XD0D4O/ . Do not connect it to a computer for this purpose. Connecting the device to a computer using the supplied USB cable allows the card in the device to be used as a mass storage device. I am using a SanDisk Extreme 32GB microSDHC card. See http://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Extreme-microSDHC-Adapter-SDSDQX-032G-U46A/dp/B00D6XXL7M/ .When using this item, always ensure that the red circle in the upper left corner of the screen is blinking. IF IT'S NOT BLINKING, IT'S NOT RECORDING. Twice the device has ceased recording. This was fixed by me by quick-formatting the memory card using the device itself. If this recurs, I will try full-formatting the card on my computer and checking its health.Statistics on a sample recorded file are below:GeneralComplete name  : X:\\DCIM\\10231202\\10030001.MOVFormat  : MPEG-4Format profile  : QuickTimeCodec ID  : qtFile size  : 560 MiBDuration  : 5mn 0sOverall bit rate  : 15.7 MbpsEncoded date  : UTC 2004-01-01 00:00:00Tagged date  : UTC 2004-01-01 00:00:00VideoID  : 1Format  : AVCFormat/Info  : Advanced Video CodecFormat profile  : High@L4.0Format settings, CABAC  : YesFormat settings, ReFrames  : 1 frameFormat settings, GOP  : M=1, N=15Codec ID  : avc1Codec ID/Info  : Advanced Video CodingDuration  : 5mn 0sBit rate  : 14.7 MbpsWidth  : 1920 pixelsHeight  : 1080 pixelsDisplay aspect ratio  : 16:9Frame rate mode  : ConstantFrame rate  : 30.000 fpsColor space  : YUVChroma subsampling  : 4:2:0Bit depth  : 8 bitsScan type  : ProgressiveBits/(Pixel*Frame)  : 0.237Stream size  : 527 MiB (94%)Language  : EnglishEncoded date  : UTC 2004-01-01 00:00:00Tagged date  : UTC 2004-01-01 00:00:00AudioID  : 2Format  : PCMFormat settings, Endianness  : LittleFormat settings, Sign  : SignedCodec ID  : sowtDuration  : 5mn 0sBit rate mode  : ConstantBit rate  : 512 KbpsChannel(s)  : 1 channelSampling rate  : 32.0 KHzBit depth  : 16 bitsStream size  : 18.3 MiB (3%)Language  : EnglishEncoded date  : UTC 2004-01-01 00:00:00Tagged date  : UTC 2004-01-01 00:00:00", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera works flawlessly", "Author": "rvanderaegen", "ReviewID": "R2FXK1Q69NI1UF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the camera as a Christmas present and had no difficulty in setting it up, there was sufficient power cord to be able to conceal behind the headliner and frame molding to make it look professionally installed. the camera works beautifully,  the HD works great in low light.
