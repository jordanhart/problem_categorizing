I purchased this elsewhere, before the flood in thailand for a ridiculous price that we'll never see again.  I've also backed up regular data on it.  I created this review simply to stop the misinformation stream here.  This drive is CAPABLE OF ignoring read or write errors but the way it stores data on the drive, and its ability to check errors is the same as any other desktop drive.  When used in a PC, the read/write modes that ignore errors are not used (and I believe cannot be used, may be wrong though).  Consumer electronics devices such as DVRs are the devices that might use this read/write mode.  You can find this information elsewhere, quoted directly from hard drive manufacturers in regards to these drives.  There is nothing dangerous about using them in for data, in raid etc. as compared to other desktop drives.", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "WD20EURS is the Drive to Get to Upgrade Your Tivo Hard Drive", "Author": "Inspired Dribble", "ReviewID": "R3QVVVPPX2KZAI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Six months ago I bought a Tivo Premiere XL with 150 HD hours of recording (has a WD10EURS 1TB Western Digital Drive in it).  Shortly later, after recording numerous high density videos I ran out of space.  Since it was more than 30 days since I had my Tivo, Tivo refused to allow me to swap out my player for an upgrade or put in another hard drive, other than buying another whole new Tivo!.I considered simply adding an external hard drive built specifically for Tivo, a simple fix (by the way, Tivo charges about twice what you can get them from Amazon, etc).  However, since I am familiar with computers and after reading how the external drives seem not hold up so well in the long run and how you might loose the programs stored on both the main drive and the external if it ever dysfunctions or you disconnect the external hard drive, I decided to just have one larger drive inside the Tivo with more recording capability.I searched on line and in the Tivo forums found that upgrading my Tivo Premiere XL would be easy and that I could increase my recording potential from 150 Hrs with the 1 TB drive in it to 300HD hours with a 2 TB WD20EURS drive (already maximized with reliability, power saving and compatible functions for Tivo and Video recording - 3 Yr Warranty).  All I needed to do was copy the contents of my current 1 TB Tivo which is already a WD10EURS to 2 TB using a Western Digital WD20EURS Hard Drive as the target drive.  By the way,  Tivo software at present WILL NOT support a 3TB drive, so do not buy one of those.To do that, I found a reference to a program called JMFS, rev 104 in Tivo forums after a Yahoo internet search.  I downloaded it, and and when I clicked on the download, I was given the option of burning the disk which I did creating a boot cd with the JMFS program on it.I then repeatedly hit F2 as my computer was starting to change the boot order to CD Rom before hard disk (change this back to hard drive when done with the copy procedure). I unplugged my Tivo, then using a Torx T10 and T15 screwdriver (purchased at Ace or online), I removed the four screws to the Tivo cover and then slid back the cover to my Tivo, and being careful not to touch anything else inside (possible shock), I removed the current Tivo hard drive which has four Torx screws holding the rail inside .  I then inserted the JMFS boot drive into my computers second CD drive and turned OFF my computer, opened the side of my computer and disconnected the power and sata belt to my computers main hard drive (leave the computers hard drive in the machine) and then connected the power and SATA plugs freed up inside my computer from disconnecting the hard drive(s) in the machine to both the old Tivo drive taken out of my Tivo and the new 2 TB drive I am copying to.  (hard drives now sitting on floor both connected next to computer).  I then started the machine allowing my computer to start and boot up from the JMFS boot disk in the CD Rom.  The program showed me both the older smaller Tivo Drive and the Newer Larger Drive and then gave me the option to copy from the smaller to the larger (make sure that you have this right), and after the copy finished (about 3-4 hours), I was given the option to expand my new drive to 2 TB for tivo, and then to supersize which only took about one second each.Done!  Nothing else needed to be done since the WD20EURS is already optimized to work with Tivo (no need to worry about parking or seek speeds or running the Wdidle program).  I simply put the new drive into my Tivo, and now it says 320 Hrs of HD recording available.Naturally, to make my computer usable again, I turned it off and  disconnected the Tivo Drives, and reconnected my hard drive power and sata belts, and started my computer hitting F2 again to access the setup and bios program and changed back the order of the boot to hard drive first.Note, that the WD20EURS needs to be aligned if instead of puting it into a Tivo or video recorder you leave it inside your computer running with Windows XT in place unless you align the hard drive first (a jumper setting), however, this is not a problem setting up a tivo drive as the JMFS boot disk that you made has its own operating system that you use when you boot and the fact that windows XT might be on your computer is totally irrelevant to the copy procedure.  So don't worry about windows XT being on your computer for this copy procedure and don't add a jumper or alter or align the WD20EURS when you get it!If I had known I was going to buy an upgrade drive, I probably would have purchased the $400 Tivo Premiere XL4 machine (cheaper on Amazon) with 300 HD hours already available and the ability to record four channels at a time instead of 2 channels and only 150 HD recording hours like the Tivo Premiere XL.  By the way, you can get a refurbished Premiere XL from Tivo with 150 HD hours for $150 at present.  And of course, it may be wise to save the old Tivo drive removed as a backup should your new drive ever fail or to put in the machine for a factory return if you need service later.The instructions to do this upgrade may be slightly different for an older version than a Tivo Premiere, however, they are readily available on the internet.  If you are not confident about doing this and are out of space, the external drive may be a much better option for you.Of course, a computer shop or hard drive cloner tool may be able to clone your Tivo Drive onto the larger drive.  However, you may still need to run the JMFS boot disk to expand the new drive to the full 300Hrs recording time and supersize (for another 20 hours) the disk and if you have less than a Premiere machine, you may need to use a different program to supersize (instructions on line).The new drive does not invalidate the ownership of your Tivo, which is recognized from a microchip in the machine.  Also, this process works fine with a machine with Windows XP as mentioned since you are using the Unix Operating system on the JMFS boot disk.  My drive although bulk OEM, was easily recognized and used for the copying of my older drive to the new.  Other drives may work for this procedure, but the WD20EURS is an AV drive optimized to conserve its resources when not being used and to be more reliable in the long run.As a side note, Comcast in our area only broadcasts at 720dpi even in high definition.  When I set my Tivo to record higher than that, the picture looked terrible, some sort of bad upsampling apparently.  So, if you don't like your picture, try setting your tivo for recording at 720 dpi.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect TiVo Upgrade HDD", "Author": "Bryan in PHX", "ReviewID": "R18G4594OOCFJR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Upgraded Stock OEM 320GB TiVo Premiere HDD using jmfs Live CD to Copy-Expand-Supersize to this 2TB WD20EURS AV-GP HDD.

So I now I wonder if it has the AV-GP firmware or not.I've opened a case with WD support.  I'll let you know what they say.UPDATE:I heard back from WD Support.  This drive is a recertified drive, as the label says.  WD will extend the warranty to 3 years from the ship date, after I send proof of purchase and a photo of the drive.Since the drive is being sold as New on Amazon, I don't think it's right for Storite to ship recertified drives instead.

An error in a couple of bytes just causes a minor blip in the video stream, but the rest won't stop. On a normal drive it could go into an error recovery mode and stop recording for 10-30 seconds - and this is much worse for security.However if you store documents, a single byte error could corrupt megabytes or even gigabytes of important data.Which you choose depends on your purpose.. but for DVR's, CCTV's Etc ie if its only going to have video on it then this is the kiddie you need!", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Compatible with TivoHD", "Author": "Paul Kackert", "ReviewID": "R98XGRRKI6MV2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used the WD20EURS to upgrade a TivoHDXL.

I believe this is totally bogus. I've read the specs and there is no mention of anything like that.

This 2TB drive is taller and probably doesn't need the foam (I left it in).  You will lose all video (EVERYTHING) on your factory stock 500GB drive in the THR22.

Verizon officially recommends 2 Western Digital external drives with eSATA connectivity; other drives are not certified to work.  The drive reviewed is of the same design as what is in the WD external drives.  It's designed specifically for DVR/surveillance equipment meaning it does not have highly complex data correction features which is a good thing for DVR/surveillance since the process of data correction can result in loss of synch with the realtime data that is being collected.  An occasional drop in data in these applications will not hurt the performance.  However, these drives are not suitable for other PC/server applications where data integrity is paramount.I had a Seagate drive which caused all sorts of problems and lock-ups with the FIOS DVR.  It was mounted in one of those external SATA stands where the drive drops in to a slot.  Simple and inexpensive and the exposed drive gets more than enough cooling since most of it is exposed to air.  Replaced it with this drive and the lock-up problems have gone away.Note:  some external cases like the Rosewill Rx-358 V2 will spin down the drive and in the case of the FIOS box, it no longer is able to start the drive back up.  So even though it thinks it's connected to the drive, you need to go into the FIOS DVR settings and eject it, then power cycle the external drive which will recover it - until the next time the Rosewill box powers down the drive.

I previously upgraded this same Tivo from the original Western Digital 250GB drive to a Hitachi Deskstar 1TB drive back in 2009.  When originally purchased this Tivo was capable of storing 32 HD hours, and 300 SD hours. After the first upgrade these figures went up to 144 hours HD, and approxiamtely 1300 hours SD.Fast forward to present, now with only 1% space left, time to delete some of that content or look for other options. After quite a bit of research, 'looked' like I could upgrade to a 2 TB drive.  I say 'looked,' due to lots of conflicting information regarding use of 2 TB drive with this particular Tivo DVR. Not to mention lots of suggestions as to which drive should be used, which is how I found this drive.  I can report a 2 TB drive can most definitely be used with this particular Tivo DVR. One caveat here, check your Tivo software version, have found many a site stating Tivo software version 11.XX or above is needed.  My Tivo has version 11, but perhaps versions under that would work? But without trying have no way of knowing for sure.For software I used WinMFS (note: not MFSLive), available free online. This software runs under a Windows environment. However you'll need a PC with Win XP service pack 2 or higher. WinMe or Win 95 will not work. You will also need a PC which has a SATA controller with at least two available (unused) ports. One port to hook up the current Tivo disk drive, the second to hook up the new drive you are going to copy to. If you only have access to a laptop, you can use a USB to SATA adapter. Though this likely will take longer to copy than the aforemention method. If your laptop has USB III ports, might not be too much difference.The WinMFS software will copy (Mfscopy) the current Tivo drive to the new drive, this will take several hours to complete. This process will also copy any previously recorded material. WinMFS will also resize (Mfsadd) the new drive to take advantage of the extra space. For example in my case I copied almost 1 TB of data to the new disk drive. I then used Mfsadd, to 'expand' this 1 TB image on the new drive, to the drives full 2 TB size.  You can also gain some additional space by setting MfsSuperSize to 'on.'  Various online info suggests keeping MfsSuperSize set to 'off' (default setting). Other sites suggest setting it to 'on.'  In my case I decided to set MfsSuperSize to 'on.'  This gained me an additional 25 hours of HD recording time.Something else I have read,  when Mfscopy is done, it will ask if you wish to resize? A number of sites suggest answering 'no' to that question. Then do it as a separate step using Mfsadd. That is exit out of WinMFS, start it back up, select your new drive, then do the Mfsadd.  I'm not sure if doing it in a separate step is necessary. But exiting out of the program, then back in only took a few seconds. So did it just that way. Right after running Mfsadd, I set MfsSuperSize to 'on.'Another thing to mention about WinMFS, is the command called Mfsinfo. I would suggest using this command before, during, and after you upgrade. Once you select your source drive (part of WinMFS process), you can run Mfsinfo. This will bring up a second window, there you will find stats on your current selected drive. This information can be saved to a text file. Then afterwards you can compare what each step has done for you.  For example as mentioned above run Mfsinfo before upgrading. Then once you have finished with Mfscopy, you can select your new drive, then run Mfsinfo. Once again save yourself a text file. Then again after doing the Mfsadd, and again after the MfsSuperSize. Make sure you change the text file name each time you save, otherwise you will overwrite the previous text file you saved.  The above is not necessary, simply meant as a way of keeping track of what is being accomplished.Also, prior to running Mfscopy, please be very careful when you are selecting a source drive and destination drive. If you make the mistake of making your current Tivo drive the destination drive, and your new blank upgrade drive as the source drive, you will wipe out your original Tivo drive. I've read the WinMFS software will actually prompt you with an error preventing you from doing so. But I would not want to bet my Tivo this is so. As such exercise a good deal of caution here.  Also some caution needs to be exercised when you first boot up Windows (after installing your original Tivo drive and your upgrade drive into your PC). After booting up, some versions of Windows may ask you if you wish to format what it thinks are new drives.  Do not answer yes or no, simply exit out of any such pop up.After completing the above, my Tivo went from 1%  space available to 51% available. Under Tivo's system information, it now shows 318 HD hours and 2777 SD hours (btw, these figures will show up in the Mfsinfo command).Now as far as the Western Digital drive; so far working great! Video quality same as before, that is to say excellent.  Also, very very quiet. The previous Hitachi drive, although would not call it loud, with the cabinet door open during quieter scenes, you could most definitely hear it softly clicking away in the background (at times even with the cabinet door closed). Again, would not describe this as loud, simply noticeable at times. This new Western Digital Drive, even with the TV muted and the cabinet door wide open, I have yet to hear it make a sound.A most definite 5 star drive!", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Totally as advertised", "Author": "GLM in VA", "ReviewID": "RJMR07RCNW9S8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to extend my recording time on my security system.

I wrote a review about the security system as well, and will re-iterate that if a machine is billed as a DVR then it is implied that the \"R\" is part of it.  Anyway, at least this way I can choose how much recording space I want it to have.  It was easy to install (I build my own computers so it's a no brainer for me, but it's very easy to see where the holes in the bottom of the hard drive line up with the DVR and to connect the cables) and once I turned on the DVR it was all set to go.  The DVR formatted the drive, and within about fifteen minutes it was recording.  So far all I can say is it's great, it's a WD green drive, and I don't expect any problems.  If I run into anything I will be sure to update my review.  I use three 1TB WD caviar drives in my own computer and they have not let me down even after a number of reformats, so I don't expect any problems here.UPDATE: I purchased this in March of 2013 and during the summer it started giving me problems.  The DVR started beeping and the drive light would stay on, indicating hard drive failure.  I opened the DVR, disconnected the drive and reconnected it, and everything seemed okay for a few months.  Now in January 2014, it really died.  No amount of disconnecting and reconnecting would resurrect the drive; it just is no longer recognized.  I also noticed the drive is now incredibly hot, even though the DVR is well ventilated as it sits on a large table with nothing around it.  I've initiated an RMA with Western Digital as it is still in-warranty (if you buy this, make note of the serial number and register it with Western Digital).  They have an option where you can give your credit card number and receive a replacement before sending the drive in, but I didn't want to do that as I wasn't really sure if they would charge my card or not.  So I was easily able to create an RMA and I just have to mail them the drive (I'm not happy about having to pay to ship them their defective item, but what can I do).

Google this issue, and one can see that many other end users are having the same problem.  WD TECH support was slow to respond to my query, and even then, never provided me with a direct link for the download.  I was unable to use MSDOS commands to FDISK, never mind format the damn thing.I was finally able to realign the disk with a LINUX program that reset it to 512 Kb rather than the 4096 Kb per sector that WD is NOW using.WD is intentionally attempting to deny access to its alignment/format software that would render its product serviceable to its end user.  WHY? Maybe I got a crappy know-nothing Techie at WD, or MAYBE I came face to face with a new mandate from Homeland Security ( maybe they got NO CYBER LISTS, guess NO FLY LISTS aren't enough).  WHO KNOWS?!  My disk is working within specs after I racked my brain to solve the alignment problem ( I have 1.82 Tb of usable space after alignment and formatting ).
