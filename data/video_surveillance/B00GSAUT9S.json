{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pros and Cons. Excellent DVR", "Author": "KHALIL HOSEIN", "ReviewID": "R34ZLHL2U6MEPM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: 1) Very light but strong construction. I was supprised at how small the hardware was inside the DVR. 75% of the DVR is empty space. When you install the hard drive then it is about 50% empty space. Which means that there is alot of room for Night Owl to make their DVR's even smaller.2) Very very easy installation. Plug and play. Hardly any configurations.3) Remote View setup was also a piece of cake. Go on the website and create and account and then take the information that they give you and input it into the night owl app. Prestow you are done.4) Alot of features for recording, motion detection, auto recording, manual recording, play back, networking, etc.5) The cameras show extremely clear expecially if you get the cams that has 700TVL and up.6) There is no delay on the cameras on the DVR. Almost instantaneos.Cons: 1) Video Play back is a little difficult to pin point the exact recording that you want but is not that bad.2) The Night Owl app on my iphone and ipad seems to have a delay of about 1 second. When my wife walked outside it took about 1 secound till the app showed her walk outside. My internet access is 20Mbps so it can't be slow internet speed.", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works Outstanding", "Author": "Timothy G.", "ReviewID": "R3CVK4ED944OL9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is excellent.

My previous unit recorded continuously and advised of alarm instances.  The alarm review on this Night Owl dvr requires too many steps to review footage, max speed is 16x, my old dvr was 64x. Also the dvr interminently fails to record.  The only good thing about it is the recorded images are very good. better than my previous dvr..Would not recommend this unit in fact I'll be looking for another.", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GSAUT9S"}}
