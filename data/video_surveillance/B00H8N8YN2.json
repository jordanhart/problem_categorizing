Received them approx 2 months ago. I have used them less than five times. The picture locks up on I-phone and Android phones after about 30 seconds of being connected to the camera. Worked a little better on the laptop, managed to take a few very grainy pictures before screen locked up. It's a total hassle to connect to the wifi endoscope network. The picture is very grainy. Now one of them will not even connect to anything, trouble shooting and support seem to be non existent. We will be sending these back!", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00H8N8YN2"}}
