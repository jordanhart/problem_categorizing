{"Reviews": [{"Title": "VTech compared to Motorola MBP36", "Author": "MLStine", "ReviewID": "R1DGOPBOSO82MX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We bought the VTech Video Monitor a few months ago and were immediately disappointed with the quality of the video and sound. The video was grainy and got worse if you tried to zoom in and the sound cut out constantly so it was not continuous. Another negative was that you could only operate the lullaby feature from the Baby Unit which meant you had to go into the baby's room and turn it on if you wanted to use it. Also, the display brightness was pretty bright, especially for nighttime viewing when your eyes need to adjust. It often hurt my eyes to look at the screen in the middle of the night.Positives for VTech: it has an great feature that allows you to turn off the screen and sound, but when it detects sound from the baby unit, it will turn on automatically (Sound Activation). The negative for that feature was that it wasn't always consistent. Sometimes it would turn on and no sound was coming through the monitor, but this was not a frequent occurance. Another positive is that the lullaby feature has an auto shut off, I believe it was 20 minutes. AND, you could operate the lullaby along with the Sound Activation feature meaning you didn't have to listen to the lullaby yourself through the parent unit because the sound would automatically shut off. This was great for middle of the night lullaby playing, especially because I'm a light sleeper.Also, the lights on the baby unit are pretty dim so it doesn't keep my baby awake and I can see with the night vision pretty well, although grainy because of the picture quality.We ended up returning the VTech because the video was not as great as I thought it should be and the sound quality was starting to bother me when it would just cut out for no reason. Also, when you add a 2nd camera (which we are about to do in a few months) it only views one camera at a time rendering one camera practically useless unless you manually check it throughout the night yourself. This might not be a bad thing for parents of older toddlers, but mine is only 2 and our new baby is coming in July so I'd like to be able to listen up for both of them.For the Motorola monitor, we went with the MBP36 because of the bigger screen and I have to say that the picture quality is far superior to the VTech, however the zoom feature is useless because it zooms in 2x which is too close up. You'd have to place the baby unit far enough away that the zoom would be worth it. So, for us, that feature is a waste.Other Negatives for Motorola: the lullaby feature is annoying. While I love that you can turn it on from the parent unit, it does not have an auto shut off AND you can hear it from the parent unit pretty loudly unless you turn the sound completely off (which means you would not hear your baby crying). Like I said, I'm a light sleeper so the lullaby keeps me awake unless I turn the sound off. So, I end up having to wake up some time later and turning the lullaby off myself and turning the sound back on. It really interrupts sleep having to do all of this at night.Positives for Motorola: the picture quality is much better. I can see more detail and I don't even have to turn the brightness all the way up. the brightness level is much better, even on the lowest setting I can still see at night so it doesn't hurt my eyes to look at it at 3am. I like that you can turn the lullaby feature on yourself without having to get out of bed, but I do wish they would have added an auto shut off to that because having to remember to turn it off is a hassle. The baby unit camera pans further so you can look around the room if you need to and you can pan from the parent unit. The VTech only shifts in one direction and you have to move it directly on the baby unit if you want to change it. It does pan slightly but nothing like the Motorola.The sound quality is much better. It is continuous, though it doesn't have that awesome Sound Activation feature like VTech, I don't hear any feedback/white noise over the monitor. Even on the lowest volume, I can hear my son.Finally, the reason we are keeping the Motorola...when you add another camera it will automatically scan all cameras for 12 seconds each, meaning I don't have to select one camera as the main one. It checks them all throughout the night. This makes me feel more secure knowing that if one baby is crying, i will be alerted no matter what.Honestly, they all have their pros and cons. You have to find what works for you. If they would combine the features of these two monitors, it would be one great unit!", "Date": "March 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "returning our second in a month", "Author": "lkp", "ReviewID": "R1QS3DJ386N1VT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We got out first about a month ago and were initially thrilled with the quality of the video.

Once that stopped, I noticed that the monitor kept jumping in and out of night vision mode. And finally, the picture is TERRIBLE. Now, to be fair, I don't expect a baby monitor to show me high definition video of my child's eyelids flickering as she sleeps, but I DO expect to be able to tell the difference between an image of my daughter and a pile of blankets.  Not so with this monitor... even in daylight! If your child does not have dark hair (as noted by another reviewer), you won't be able to tell if she/he is in the crib. I think VTech made an effort the provide a feature-rich monitor at an affordable price, but they just didn't pull it off. The picture on this monitor is, as far as I am concerned, totally worthless. Moreover, since it was behaving so strangely from the minute I plugged it in, I didn't feel like I could trust it. I am in the process of returning this monitor and I have ordered a Motorola instead... hopefully with better results! If you're on a budget and don't want to pay for the Motorola, try the Summer Infant brand, which has a pretty clear picture.  In fact, I was pleased with my Summer Infant model except for the range - which was only 400' \"outdoors\" and did not suffice for my home.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "monitor", "Author": "Lynn", "ReviewID": "R3TB3M39EKV3QA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband actually uses this to monitor who is at the door.

(Don't let the lower reviews scare you...try it for yourself and you'll see.)", "Author": "J. Schmidt", "ReviewID": "RJ7TR6P698TS6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this monitor over a year ago, and it has been wonderful. We have had absolutely no problems with it. The battery life on the parent unit is very good, even after daily use for over a year. The range is excellent as well - I can walk down the street 3 or 4 houses and still have good reception. (It could probably go even farther, but just haven't tried it.) In addition, there have been no problems with interference from our wifi or anything else.Despite some of the reviews, I think the picture is very good and quite clear, maybe not wonderful, but come on, this is a baby monitor, not meant to shoot high resolution videos. I can see my little one very well with the night vision, and when the camera is positioned correctly and zoomed, I could see the rise and fall of his breathing in the early months when the SIDS fear/paranoia was at an all time high for this first time mom. The zoom isn't very clear, but it did the job. No, you can't move the camera using the parent unit, which would be nice but shouldn't be a problem when your baby is confined to a crib. And for toddlers...well, do you really need to watch them every waking/sleeping minute? Plus, if you can hear them moving/doing something and see they are not in bed, common sense should tell you to check on them.As for the white noise, you can turn the sensitivity down, which worked for me (3 is our magic number). Even when I have it set at the highest sensitivity, the white noise really isn't that bothersome. I've never had problems falling asleep, and it has definitely never woken me up.The additional features on this monitor are an added bonus. The lullabies are pretty good, and we've used them a few times. The room temperature indicator is pretty accurate, and you can set an alarm to sound if it gets too hot or too cold in the room. The best thing is the ability to talk to your child through the monitor. I don't think you will find this feature in any other monitor in this price range.Maybe some of these units are flawed, or maybe people have unrealistic expectations for a monitor in this price range or any baby monitor for that matter. I don't know. All I know is the monitor I received was well worth the money and then some. It can compete well with many of the higher end monitors, and is much higher quality than most of the others in this price range. (I've tried others out.)Bottom line...try this monitor and decide for yourself. If you receive a unit like I received, I guarantee, you won't need or want to return it. And with Amazon's A-Z return policy (and free returns for this item), what do you have to lose?", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "LOVE it!", "Author": "RBMarshall", "ReviewID": "RR7GO3MA55D3H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have owned an older model of the Summer Infant Baby monitor since my son was born - It was the only thing within our price range and it was bulky and didn't have that great of a picture; however for $70.00 I couldn't complain. Other video monitors were SO expensive (I'm talking in the $150.00 and plus range) I wouldn't even consider looking into them because I knew I could never put that kind of money into something that wasn't absolutely necessary to have.After coming across this video monitor, at the price - I had to give it a look. Read the reviews, some good some bad (like just about any product nowadays) Decided to give it a try. As a reference - we live in an 800 sq ft. apartment so we don't need  a huge range on this.The monitor arrived rather quickly. Set up was easy and the handheld charged pretty quick. This monitor is amazing! I have absolutely no problem with the video or picture and I love the portability and convenience. The picture quality (especially compared to our last monitor) is crystal clear and I love being able to see him in color.The handheld device has a \"walkie talkie\" like feature which allows me to talk to my son from the other room if I hear him rustling or getting upset. It also has a zoom feature which we don't use but I can see if we had a different set up how it could come in handy.We actually still kept our other video Summer Infant monitor and have it set up in a different playroom now and it doesn't interfere with the Vtech camera whatsoever which is SO nice!The only thing I would change is the fact that you cant make the camera play its lullaby's from the handheld device. But that's not really ever a big deal because half the time I forget the camera has lullaby's anyway haha (didn't have them before so they're easy to forget)Overall I would highly recommend this product especially at this price!

The resolution is pretty low and sometimes you have to stare pretty hard at it to see breathing, but the zoom feature usually handles that very well.So far it hasn't had any feedback problems which is very very nice.

If comparing the two, the old one (Levana) was much better video quality wise. This one seems very choppy and pixelated.

We use this one for our 3 year old who sleeps on the opposite end of the house from us, and will use a second monitor for our new baby in a few months. It may be the distance that causes the poor quality or interference from other electronics in the house. I dislike that you can't turn the video off, only the sound. Our other monitor had the option to turn the whole picture off as well as sound. We tested the sensitivity of the sound and on the highest setting, you had to practically yell to get it to come on. I noticed a complaint was that it was too sensitive, but that is not the case for us. As far as everything else goes, it is a great monitor. Sound quality is great.

Nothing changed so it does not make a lot of sense.==========================My original review is below.  I am downgrading from 4 stars to 2.The functionality is fine.  The problem now is that I have to re-link the camera to the parent unit every time I use it.  Distance (~20-30 feet) is not an issue.I have done the full reset described in the trouble shooting and that seemed to help for a while, but now the linking has gotten worse and worse until now I have to re-link manually for each use.  I will probably do that reset again, but it a pain and I don't want to have to do it often.  It is bad enough to have to re-link each time.I think somewhere in the manual it is mentioned that problems might be caused by other signals.  Modern houses are full of signals (wifi, bluetooth, phones, etc.) and a unit such as this needs to deal with it.Original ReviewI just got this today and I will give it 4 stars.  I don't think I could give it 5 stars unless the the screen had better resolution and color.  Don't get me wrong, the screen is fine for the intended purpose.I bought this here in the Philippines for our new born and I didn't have many choices in this area.  Imported goods are expensive.  I only found 2 locally, this one and a Phillips Avent that was the equivalent of $400 USD!  This one cost me about $150 USD.Before the purchase I was mainly worried that the units would not penetrate our inner and outer concrete block walls.  However, it does just fine and it will transmit from both the front and back yards.  I tested it out to about 100 ft or so.  You can't see the screen in bright sunlight but that is normal for any LCD.All of the features work as advertised.  The night infrared viewing works well.  There was one unknown feature that I did not see mentioned, but it is quite handy.  The camera unit has a tripod mount on the bottom, so I mounted it on my older lightweight tripod.  We can easily move it to any place where we need it positioned, and easily adjust height, angle, etc.  Most likely I will never use the included wall mount.", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Hopeful", "Author": "leslie ennis", "ReviewID": "R1EV76L00HG0DQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We have LOVED this monitor, and have taken it with us anywhere we went overnight.

I'll probably come back in a few weeks and update it, but for now I'm really liking this monitor. I have 3. I purchased the Angelcare motion detection monitor without video because the video one was #1 very expensive and #2 did not have very good reviews. The Angelcare is awesome btw; it detects if the baby stops breathing. Anyway, I was given a Summer Infant monitor, but it's those big tv like black and white screens and it's not portable, so I chose to purchase this one. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the screen is too thick to fit in my pocket, but it is certainly not an issue. It does have a clip, so you can clip it on, but it will only work well if you're wearing jeans. I'm sure I'll somehow manage to drop it if it's clipped on. The screen is a good size and it's very clear. The sound is also very clear and you cannot hear static while it's quiet. If you have more than one child, you can buy an additional camera and the screen splits so you can watch both at the same time. It has a temperature indicator which is good to have (Angelcare also comes with that feature). It has a stand so you can stand it up for easy view at night. You can talk to your baby as well although I cannot comment on how useful this feature is.  It has all the features the higher priced items have. The battery is rechargeable and I have not yet tested how long it lasts, but if you leave it charging it at night, it should serve its purpose during the day. For me, I do not forsee this being an issue.
