Contacted Swann, they said this is by design, must export it in h.264 format to retain audio.  If you use the \"MyDVR\" software (from your PC) for it, you can export it to AVI and retain sound, but you can only do one file at a time (from the device you can select many files at once).  This is really painful if you need to export many files to AVI.  If you leave it in h.264, you have to send the \"Player\" software to the user so they can view it and the \"Player\" software is not very user friendly. I asked Swann for two possible solution, 1. fix the device so I can export to AVI with audio or 2. fix their \"MyDVR\" software so I can export many files at once.  I hope they are able to do this as using the unit in its current state is painful when I need to export many files for the client.", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Swann SWDVK-840004", "Author": "W. Adkins", "ReviewID": "R22TDCFY5HHU8E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this with the intentions of buying more cameras. That's why I went with a 8 channel. The cameras that come in the package are great for up close to about 50' away as far as making out details in daylight. The night vision is average. You can see about 30'-40' and make out details. You can see allot further both night and day but your not going to read a license plate. I am very happy with the unit. I have already ordered more cameras to go along with this setup that are better because I need to see farther away. Setting up to see over the internet was a bit tricky even for swann techs. I had to talk to two different techs to get it right. They did every thing remotely and I am very happy with there customer service. Swannview app works great on android after you figure it out but it only takes about 5 minutes. Overall I am very happy with this unit. I would buy it again if I had to. I did not buy this on Amazon because It wasnt avalible at the time. I purchased it at Best Buy in stock at my local store. And yes I did copy/paste my review from BB.", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dead on arrival, Poor tech support", "Author": "avontbone", "ReviewID": "RSCGB516N2SER", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Plugged everything in and within the first ten minutes it kept crashing during the setup wizard.  Tried everything and talked to tech support for well over an hour.  I'm used to bad tech support, but Swann brought it to a whole new level.  The agent didn't recognize this model and kept asking questions like \"how many cameras is this model?...how many channels is this model\".  Very poor quality tech support.", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Company", "Author": "George M.", "ReviewID": "R25M3AEF7GEP9N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have three different Swann DVR Security Systems and all of them are still working today.

I purchased this system in August 2013 and installed it in September 2013.  By mid-October, the hard-drive had 200+ errors (the maximum that SMART drive will monitor) and had stopped recording *anything*.  The motion-sensing never did work correctly even with repeated changes to sensitivity and calls to their tech support.  The DVR will not transfer video to a pen drive (at all).  I finally sent the DVR in for RMA replacement in mid-November.  To get the RMA number, you tell them all information including receipt information.  Nearly a week later, I receive an email stating that I needed to include the receipt - and that I could either send or email it to them.  So I emailed a copy of the receipt on 23 November.  Today, 3 December I have still heard NOTHING.  I called Friday 29 November and there was a recording stating that their business hours were 8:30-5:30 PST and that they were closed 28-29 for thanksgiving.  So I called on Monday - 11 times... Same recording... I called Tuesday, 3 December, starting at 8:30 PST - 4 times, still getting the same recording.  I had to call tech support and ask them to get someone on the line before I actually was able to speak to a CS representative.  I was then told that it had been tested *yesterday* (a full 10 days after they received it) and they had determined that it was in fact defective (duh) and would be shipped **Wednesday** 4 December.  Given my location in Chicago and theirs in California, there is a *strong* likelihood that I will not receive the replacement before Saturday (at best) or next week.  Keeping in mind that it hasn't worked since mid-October, I will have been without a functioning camera system for 2 full months.  And not a single person there seems to care.It isn't just their customer service that is appallingly bad (and it is) - but their service in general.  Look at their website for firmware updates.  Out of their entire portfolio of products, fewer than 10 have *ever* received a software update.  The push the products out then forget about them. Period.  Look around the internet at reviews of Swann's DVR software - it truly is horridly buggy - yet it never receives updates.  I paid $500 for this camera system and would simply never ever recommend a Swann product to anybody.  If the cameras weren't already themselves installed (and that is, by the way, no small task), I'd tear the whole system out, box it up, and send it back and demand my money back.  It is *that* bad.  Trust what the other reviewers say - Swann is awful from front to back.For the sake of discussion, I am a programmer for the US federal government - I know my way around techy things.  I can also spot terrible software - something that Swann apparently excels at producing.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Swann review", "Author": "bill scott", "ReviewID": "R8HKHTL1WR6UW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The unit seems to work fine however there was no soft ware with the unit and there is a pass word that I have to get removed from Swann So the unit is almost worthless until I get the pass word removed.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$599.99", "Features": "Includes DVR, remote, 4 cameras (each with 60-ft. cable), BNC to BNC cable, RCA mini jack cable, power adapters, earphones, software, mouse, theft deterrent stickers and instructions.", "Name": "Swann 4-Channel DVR Security System with 4 Cameras, Model# SWDVK-440004", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/319PWp1GmbL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008SV9AHC"}}
