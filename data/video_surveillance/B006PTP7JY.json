If you're handy enough to install your own hard drive, this might be one to get.  Recommend a 500gb at least.  Manufacturer told me not to go all the way to 2TB, they've run into problems with stability with that big a drive. Don't forget to make it an AV rated hard drive.  I used a Western Digital Green Power 500gb, which worked fine!Also, ran into one problem: you must use IE to view the box over the network.  And, IE 9 has a glitch with setting up alarm areas per each channel.  IE 8 works fine, or just go to the console to set it up there.

Reading some of the reviews made me a bit nervous on this system, but I ordered it anyway. Here's the deal. For this price you are getting three of the cameras for free. Someone said there were no screws included for the sun shade on the cameras. That is not a screw hole. It is there in case you want to mount the camera UNDER something. That way the swivel mount can screw into the top. The iris shade is on a well designed pressure slide. It will not move by itself. Someone else said the colors are off. Maybe they had some adjustment issues. I installed mine and the colors are pretty much true to life, at least in my application. If you are new to this, first do what they tell you to do, set it all up and TEST it BEFORE you run all the cables! Second, mark with tape the end of the cable that goes into the dvr, or the camera if you want. DO NOT run the cables and then discover you ran them backwards! I dropped a 2T HD in and of course it has to format. Someone complained it wanted to format the drive. It takes about two minutes and you are ready to record. A sweet little system for this price is hard to find. A huge bonus is you can always add four more cameras later if you want.", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Chinese product has just hit whole new low", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R23CYHXJRJCRSS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I gave two stars because this is truly a miracle come true.  However the miracle lies in how far the Chinese mfg are willing to go in the name of cost saving.  For example, in order to save cost they skip screw to fasten the little \"hood\" that goes over the camera.Just to be fair, DVR does work, and so does the cameras.  Do they work well, no.  One of the camera IR emitter promptly burn out half of its LEDs after only 3 hours of on time.  Now, let's go over a few things.- Camera resolution.  It's so bad that you won't be able to see facial feature of a person standing 15 feet away.  So, for the purpose of security camera to ID the bad guy, this camera will most certainly fail the task.- Camera color.  Brown looks purple.  Green looks gray.  But, it is able to tell colors apart.  Since I only spend $120 for the whole set, I think I can live with it.- DVR resolution and frame rate.  Grossly over estimated on Zmodo's web site.  240fps in CIF mode. with 60fps in D1 mode.  Keep in mind this frame rate is share by all channels.  But when I tried to set 30FPS for channel one and two, the software knock me back to 18fps max.  What gives?!?!For comparison, I also own Foscam FI8918W IP cam.  Although both cameras have similar spec. This unit makes the Foscam FI8918W unit look like HD cam.All in all, this set is good enough if you just want to know if some is snooping around house, or check to see if UPS/Fedex left package at your front door.  For true security camera usage, the resolution of the camera and usable frame rate will need to be much better.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Why I don't like this DVR", "Author": "Wayne L Bolin", "ReviewID": "R2MWKNBMSH5JYJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This DVR does not have adequate ventilation, nor does it have a fan.  I ran this overnight, opened it, touched the hard drive and almost burned my fingers.  For sure any hard drive won't last long.Also, if you set your system up to do motion detect and record at the same time, this DVR does not break the files up, meaning you cannot view the motion detect files.  The only way to see them is to look in the log file and they are buried deep inside there.  absolutely you cannot possibly view the motion detect files on the pc client software.  The only way to view the motion detect files is to set the schedule to not record continuous and record motion only, then they are available.I have the 4 channel version and I can list both motion and continuous at the same time.I removed this unit and bought their 16 channel and it works great, 2 fans and can record continuous and motion at the same time and review each as I like.I do however love the cameras,  big bang for the buck.

I just found on the app store \"vMEye+\" that allows you to view this model on Mac!  The app is just ok but does work.  For iPad read my notes below!I just got this today.  I don't think you can beat it for the price.  Here is what you need to know.1. It doesn't come with a hard drive.  Thats one reason why the lower price. But I bought a 1T for $100 and put it in myself.  It was simple.  Or they have an option on here to buy this same system with a 500g drive around $250.  More than I paid with a 1T drive.2. The cameras are not good in low light.  Compared to some other cameras I had these are poor. Especially poor for outdoor use.  You could however use them in a small room or position them to be right on a door. With the money you save buy a higher end night camera and you'll be set.3. Customer service for me was awesome!  Seriously, I'm still shocked it was so good.  I called twice and had hardly any wait.  Both times they were great to help out. My previous experience with another security DVR company was not the same...4. I did get my remote viewing to work on iPad 2 and iPod touch using the \"APlayer\" app.  It was free in the app store.  Someone else said it didn't work but seems to be fine for me. The viewable window on the iPad is formatted to the size of my iPod but you can hit the 2x and stretch it.  It works at a low quality.  It would be nice to see an update for the iPad. Still ok though.The instructions are not so easy.  Most DVR security companies seem to have this problem but I would recommend this to a friend without a doubt.

I bought it and within a few hours the price went back up.  That was cool.In addition to this DVR unit, I also purchased the Western Blue 1 TB Desktop Hard Drive: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0088PUEPK/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00  The hard drive was easy to install, and has been working great.  Four cameras at the highest quality records about 3 weeks before it begins to loop.The unit is an 8-channel DVR.  It came with 4 low-end cameras. They work pretty well in daylight, and have a nice wide view.  However, there are many colors that they do not produce very well, and the night vision is extremely limited.  Blue will look like purple, and black looks pink.  Still, for keeping an eye on your porch, doors, deck, and so on - they do pretty well.To improve clarity for night vision you can raise the brightness level via the operating software.  This helps considerably.  However, as it becomes daylight, the brightness level has to be reduced or you would not be able to see anything.  It would be nice if there was a timer built into the operating system that automatically returned levels to normal during daytime hours. NOTE: if an event is recorded in very dark conditions you can NOT adjust the brightness levels to see better with this system.  You must adjust the level before the event is recorded to have the improved view.  So, in the morning I adjust the brightness back, and in the evenings I raise it up.The DVR has a pretty simple and easy to operate interface.  I have it attached to my router, and can view the four cameras from anywhere on my Droid phone, or another computer.  One camera is set to detect motion and will email me photos.  This is working fine.In addition to a computer monitor port, the DVR has a video line-out that allows you to run it to another device, like a TV.  I haven't used this feature yet, but plan on running it to two of my TVs in the near future (via a splitter).So, for around $200 I have a decent security system, which allows me to see who is at the door, and to watch the kids play in the yard.  Because of the low-grade cameras, I think that I would probably have trouble identifying bad guys, especially at night.  Also, because the color representation is so poor, you can't trust telling the police what color car was seen lurking around.I am guessing that some better grade cameras would greatly improve this system.

There simply isn't a better deal.It shipped in time.Simple to use pre programmed features such as time stamps, switching views, single cam and or multi cam, audio, can use other cams, Ethernet port, VGA port, USB drive. Comes with a mouse. I mean what more do u want for this price? Similar systems go for over 300$!???

Cameras set up easily and having the ability to expand to 8 is a real plus. Once you start there are alway more things that you want to cover.If you add cameras go for better quality. These are great for close range however not the best at distance.Overall I recommend this system as an easy to set up plug and play design", "Date": "July 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Deal, Great price!", "Author": "Max K", "ReviewID": "R14T0YOOXED66M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This must be the best inexpensive surveillance system out there! Everything is ready out of the box and easy to set up! The smart thing you should do is to buy your own hard drive to save even more! This is a 100% four star item but I give it an extra star for excellent price tag!Pros: No factory Hard Drive(buy/use your own, seriously). Easy to set up DVR with full 30 fps, 704X480 recording. Lots of options to play with and 4 more channels(8 total) to extend your surveillance! At night ZModo cameras are even better and have a bit sharper image and better range than my old security cameras.Cons: First of all you have to understand that you shouldn't expect professional HD quality and video recording from a $100 system. This is affordable home security with decent quality cameras and recorder. These cameras have indeed slight color problem with lots of purple instead of green however the image is sharp and way much better than black&white.; I also have another cameras from my old security system which have more colors but over all image quality is not that far from what you get from Zmodo.Other thoughts: Surveillance system market is big and there are lots of systems ranging from a hundred to thousands of dollars. You can pay more but will you get better quality system? Big question! My previous system was at $500 range with almost same quality 4 channel DVR recorder and only 2 cameras. Bottom line is, if you are looking for affordable home security system that will do its job this is the way to go!", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "bad cameras", "Author": "HTC mytouch 4G charger", "ReviewID": "R34BEEKIA8MZ46", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bad cameras, bad quality, can't see anything at night.DVR is okay butthere is not Hard Drive so consider spending $150.00 top buy Hard drive.Cameras didn't last more than 3 months.", "Date": "July 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't do it!", "Author": "T.
