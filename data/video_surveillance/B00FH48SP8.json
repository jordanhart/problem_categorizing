Only the power/ red cable is male to female. Yes that is in the description. but when ordering a extension cable you would think that it would extend your cable without needing another connecter. I have now ordered my connecters and once I have them I will update this review. Just be aware you will need a BNC Female to Female Connector Adapter to use this cable.", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00FH48SP8"}}
