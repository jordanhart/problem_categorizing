Even though motion detection recording is the QC8016 \"default\" NVR setting, motion detection recording doesn't work with these cameras.Then I did some research and found that Onvif 2.2 is required on both the NVR and IP Cameras for motion detection to work.  I read that both the NVR and cameras are Onvif 2.0.  I'll update this thread if I find a work-around solution.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Takes a lot of time to work out bugs.", "Author": "gsh2x", "ReviewID": "R3GJWKLGFO0B53", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Extremely hard to get to work properly with non-Q-See cameras.

I've been installing closed circuit video for over 20 years now.  The recording on this NVR is three time greater than Analog.  Its very simple to setup.  The problems that I have is only 4 POE ports built into the unit and that the front panel has no functions what so ever.  Forget that grainy analog cctv and step up and get great picture quality with this NVR.  The product is sold and backed by Amazon so you cant go wrong", "Date": "May 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009F7EQAY"}}
