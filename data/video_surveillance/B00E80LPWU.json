When the package arrived an important item was missing from the box. Hey humans make mistakes, it seems as they pack per order, which is pretty cool.  I called the vendor directly and they answered the phone immediately (Hooray a real person!)  They were very understanding and apologetic and within a day or two, via expedited shipping, I had the item i needed to complete the order.  It really puts faith in humanity to come across service like this.  These are great people and I will MOST CERTAINLY order from them again when I decide to expand my setup to more cameras (adding a larger power supply to support more.)", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "eh...", "Author": "T-hay \"T Man\"", "ReviewID": "R1NEQHFULAA8YZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The power fails when 3 cameras are plugged up.
