{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Better than I had expected, great value", "Author": "Jeremy", "ReviewID": "R1PHKX9DH0AWCU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been eyeing several different options for a few months and finally landed on this kit.  This kit comes with a camera that is much better than some of the cheaper Zmodo kits out there.  In daylight they work very well.  For night time, there are more IR LEDs on the units, although night vision isn't amazing.  Either way, if you come to my door in the middle of the night, I can easily distinguish your face.  Kit includes everything you need to get going minus a hard drive.  Installing the HD took literally 3 minutes.  It auto-detected the drive and formatted itself.Networking was a breeze (forward 4 ports) and boom, you can watch from internet explorer, or any IP cam viewer app via your mobile phone or tablet.Overall a really good purchase.... I'm proud of my self for installing 4 cameras in less than a day.", "Date": "June 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$159.99", "Features": "Support Remote View: PC & 3G/4G Mobile\nNo Hard Drive is Installed - Supports up to 2TB HD\nBNC & VGA output", "Name": "Zmodo 8CH H.264 DVR Video Security Camera System with 4 IR Outdoor Surveillance Cameras - No Hard Drive", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ealTrWsOL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009ENVS9G"}}
