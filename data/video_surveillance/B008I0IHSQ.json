I paid 98.99 for mine, the price went up since. Still worth it. Sure the picture is not HD, but you can recognize faces, just aim it at doorways and driveways, not across the backyard. The night vision is not bad either. People were gripping about that too, just don't aim them across the neighborhood they work FINE. They also gripped about the color. Yeah green is kinna purple, but you know what color trees are, it's not important. THIS PRODUCT IS WELL WORTH 100 - 150.00 The setup is easy, ran the wires under the house to outside, the iPhone setup was super easy. Added the harddrive, EASY.

It just doesn't get any better than this system right here.  To all the people who whined about the quality of the camera resolution, get real, these cameras are $50-$60 equivalent cameras sold in this package for around $11 so if you really need hd on your security cams, pay the extra for hd cams!  The DVR has all the features you can fathom including pan/tilt (for cams equipped with such), motion detection record w/scheduled rec and you can even reject motion on certain areas of the view, there are lockout settings to allow different users access to different cams and settings, there is local and internet remote control or view (again depending on user presets),  customer service is good, directions aren't bad.  If I could give it 6 stars I would.  Buy it if you have use for it and if you have a little bit of tech background to install it.  Everything's made in China but if you can find me one made in the USA that does the same ill happily pay double.", "Date": "June 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good for the money, works well, you need to buy a hard drive", "Author": "E. A. Bustos \"Techie\"", "ReviewID": "R1OCFGMF6UV4W0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this from Woot about six months ago at around a hundred dollars, which I thought was a great price since at the time I had seen it for twice as much.  I had it sitting around in the original box for a few months, trying to find someone to install it.  I finally found someone to install it for me, and luckily I opened the box the day before he came to start setting it up.One thing I noticed from reading the description on Woot and this description is that I could not find mention that this does NOT come with a hard drive.  Since it touts the fact that it records I assumed it would come with at least a little something it would record onto, but to my surprise it didn't.  So much for being so cheap, but I would have liked to know ahead of time that I had to buy a separate device since it seemed to include everything.  When I bought my TiVo it's billed as a DVR - digital video recorder - and the recorder is part of the name so the recording device is included.  Personally, I don't think it should say DVR since it doesn't become one until you actually buy the hard drive.  Anyway, my neighborhood has been somewhat sinking in quality and a friend who lives not too far away had her home broken into while she was home with her family  so I decided that safe is better than sorry and splurged for a 2TB WD hard drive (that's the largest the DVR will accept, and make sure you buy an AV-GP rated drive so that it lasts longer; the manual specifically states not to use a regular computer hard drive).  So that added about another hundred bucks to this purchase, plus the installation for me was another hundred bucks but I don't mind the money since I now have peace of mind.The manual that comes with it is not organized very well, and I've actually misplaced it, but the zmodo website has all the information you need.  They have the manual online, which now that I'm switching to a paperless office I prefer to just have the manuals on my computer as PDFs and then access them when I need them.  When you install the HDD, you have to go to the menu and format it first, it will beep at you for a while when you first turn it on after installing it.  Actually, any time you turn the machine off and then back on it beeps at you.  And you don't realize it's formatting; I saw that it was starting to format then the screen disappeared and I couldn't access anything on the menu until about fifteen minutes later.  I assume that it was formatting during that time since I bought a behemoth of a hard drive so I just left it on it's own and when I came back I was able to get into the menu.I'm still having trouble accessing the DVR from my computer and from the app, but that's just related to my getting all the network settings and IP addresses and whatnot that my computer is giving me trouble with.  Overall it's really very good; yes, the colors are off but I can recognize people and I have the peace of mind that people can see the cameras and hopefully will move on to another house if they have nefarious purposes.  They seem to hold up well with the weather, and are quite sensitive with motion detection because the other day it snowed and the motion detector was constantly on.  Once I am able to access the device remotely I feel I'll be good; I have the Zviewer app on my iPhone, I just need those settings.  There are also many YouTube videos that help you with getting the settings and setting the system up.  I took off one star because of the lack of mentioning the DVR has no \"R\" included, but that shouldn't deter you from this device.  Better safe than sorry.UPDATE: Zmodo technical support is awesome!  I had about a twenty minute wait for a technician, but it was worth it.  The technician connected to my computer, also had issues connecting to my DVR from the computer (that actually made me feel good because I'm a tech person and it was really bugging me that I couldn't do it myself, there was apparently something else going on because the tech had quite a time with the software, which ultimately didn't install) but was able to finally connect using Internet Explorer.  NOTE: If you're using IE 64 bit, you won't be able to connect, it will keep asking you to install Active X then not work.  You have to connect with IE (and yes, sadly only IE) 32 bit.  The tech then went to configure access so that I can view the cameras on my iPhone remotely, but wasn't able to because of my modem.  He explained exactly what I had to tell Time Warner Cable to do to my cable modem, and also mentioned that I should request at least a tier 2 support person.  He even left a detailed note in notepad for me to reference when calling TWC.  I've never experienced such extensive support from a company before, AND I didn't even have to pay for that support!  I then contacted Time Warner Cable (via Twitter, calling on the phone is pretty useless) and a tier 3 support person actually called me back.  If you have TWC you most likely won't be able to have the open the required ports, but they will bridge the modem to your router and since the tech had previously connected the ports to my router, in a snap I was set up and viewing my cameras remotely.  A really great product and with such amazing technical support why go anywhere else.

Also ZMODO, why would you not at least include one or two Video Surveillance warning signs or decals in the box? That way when you have it installed you can be ready to go legally. Not having to order in or go purchase a sign off the get go, I can understand not sending a dozen signs in the box, but at least one or two would be of some help.

The system seems to work as well as I would expect for the price I paid. My original review spoke of the cable length not being 60' as advertised. I installed the forth camera today and took the opportunity to measure the cable before the installation. The cable measured out at 56.5'. While this is short of the advertised 60' it's not that big of a deal. I changed my 4 star rating to 5. I have had some vandalism taking place in the alley behind my business. I placed the cameras in locations to keep an eye on my back door, but high enough to be out of the line of sight. The small camera size makes them very inconspicuous. I used an old computer monitor to help with the setup. After going though the online network setup that Zmodo has on their website, I did have to call Zmodo tech to help me with the final tweaks to be able to monitor the system from my computer and smart phone. I had about a 30 minute wait on hold until the tech answered. He was very helpful and easy to understand, unlike some help lines. I can now view the cameras from any of my computers, and my android phone, either on my business network, home network, or the 4G network.As I expected, the image quality isn't like that of more expensive cameras. I can make out faces pretty well up to about 25 feet daytime, and about 15 feet at night. The night vision is better that thought it would be, and the daytime isn't as good as I had hoped. But since I'm only having trouble at night, it should work out just fine. Fortunately, I haven't had any vandals since the cameras have been in place. I have discovered that my IP address on my wireless router changes sometimes, I have been told that this is because I have a dynamic IP address. You will have to change your remote access IP code on your smart phone and remote computer when this happens.

It's nice and clean looking. The user interface looks crappy but I didn't pay much for it so I don't expect a pretty UI on it. It's also not that intuitive/user-friendly but I'm pretty familiar with it now . It was much easier than I thought it would be to install the hard drive. The screws on the DVR cover weren't even on it yet (they were in a bag with the hard drive screws) which made it easier to install the hard drive since I didn't have to unscrew each screw on the hard drive first. It came with the screws for the hard drive as well as the hard drive cover. I got a 500GB \"white label\" hard drive for $45 on another site and it's working great.The DVR has motion detection recording which is really nice. You can set it to continuously record or to only record when it detects motion. You can also set it up to send you an email when it detects motion and attach a picture of the motion it detected.- - - - - - - -EDIT: I have now successfully set up the networking stuff. It didn't take me too long, and I followed Zmodo's tutorial but I have experience with networking so it was pretty easy. You just have to open a few ports on your router. I can view my cameras anywhere on my iPhone as well as from any computer (that has Internet Explorer - ugh, I know... but it requires ActiveX to work). I couldn't get the email notification to work though - it just wouldn't work. I would've constantly been getting emails anyway though since the motion detection recording is triggered all the time.- - - - - - - -The DVR has 8 BNC video inputs, 2 BNC outputs, 4 RCA audio inputs, 2 USB inputs (one for mouse and one for flash drive to back up files), 1 ethernet input, 1 VGA output (for monitor), and the power input.- - - - - - - - - - - - -Part 2: The CamerasThis system comes with 4 cameras but the DVR is 8 channel so I have the ability to extend it if I need to add more cameras. The cameras were a little bigger than I expected them to be, but they're not too big. A couple years ago I got a couple of Lorex cameras from Radio Shack, and they're a bit smaller than these Zmodo cameras; I was expecting the Zmodo cameras to be as small as the Lorex ones. They do have more IR lights (night vision) on them though. The Lorex cameras that I previously had have microphones built in to them but the Zmodo cameras do NOT have microphones. I'm using the Lorex camera for the front door (so I have audio) but you can buy this small microphone to attach to one or more of the Zmodo security cameras for audio: VideoSecu High Sensitive Audio Pickup Device External Amplified Tiny Spy Microphone for CCTV Security Camera with Bonus Warning Decal WD6 You'll have to purchase a cord that has the audio though too (they're available here on Amazon - 100ft video+audio+power cable for around $10).The cameras come with brackets and the mounting screws. It's kind of difficult to get it just right but I haven't had issues with the mounting brackets like others have had - they didn't break and I tightened it pretty good. Also, the camera colors are pretty accurate. I noticed some people have said that the camera colors aren't accurate but mine are pretty accurate.The night vision isn't that great, but it's better than just a black screen. You can see more than shadows but still not enough to identify someone. Lights that are outside your house make the night vision better though.- - - - - - - - - - - - -Overall, I am very happy with this system. I got a nice 8 channel DVR with 4 cameras for a great deal.PLEASE NOTE: This system does not come with a hard drive installed in the DVR, you have to buy it separately.

I recorded an image, watched it then a few hours later I tried to find the image/instance again and couldn't do so. It made me wonder if I somehow overwrote it without realizing. I also noticed once I started tinkering with it too much (too many buttons pushed on the remote) it would become unresponsive which can only be rectified by turning it off/on.

And after purchasing this DVR system we had to purchase a completely different DVR system. The cameras themselves work good. As far as the nighttime view the cameras to have night vision installed but, work very poorly; if you are wanting to do anything in the dark past 10 feet you will most likely not see it in any detail or at all. The DVR they send with the cameras has no memory that is sold separately something they do not mention. The cost of getting a hard drive is more than what the entire bundle package costs. Knowing this now we would've bought the DVR and cameras separately.
