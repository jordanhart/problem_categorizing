I promptly emailed the company to let them know.  They were quick to respond and said they would get a new one sent to me.  It arrived about 7 days later, again by USPS.  This one was physically intact.  I plugged it in to the DVR and noticed it is a bit more blurry then the Evertech 700TVL cameras I have. Evertech just recently raised their prices, so i figure for $13 total with shipping I would give these a shot.  Don't regret it.  They appear to run a bit warm, and I doubt they would last very long in the elements, but i will give it a try on my enclosed deck.  The LEDs do an OK job when the lights are out.  The display view is more narrow then my other 3.6mm cameras, so i am going to assume they aren't getting a full 90 degrees.All in all, for the money this camera works.  Granted, I have only been running it for a few days.  But, if you are wanting a new wide angle nighttime color camera for the indoors, give this one a shot.", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "This is a pretty good camera", "Author": "larry", "ReviewID": "R4DLWD25CJT6S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For like 11 bucks, you cant beat this camera. This is of course an indoor camera, but that's okay. Some colors are a bit washed out and poor, but it meets expectations. Night vision on this camera is GREAT! I don't think this camera is really 700 TVL. This is a good camera, I would recommend.", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "its ok", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R10BBOLVZ4TRZ3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The picture is a little blury does not come with needles to hang and black lookes blue but otherwise very good", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "junk", "Author": "Bobby s", "ReviewID": "RU9ZDSO4ZY2ZG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The image turned black and white after a couple of day's of having it.
