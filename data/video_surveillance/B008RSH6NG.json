{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Still works great", "Author": "Confidential Name", "ReviewID": "R3UO8ENX3HGAGR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Normally I don't have kind things to say about any Chinese made item. This one still surprises me after a couple of months. Not only was it far cheaper ($20 in lieu of $500) of other models I've purchased, but it still actually works with daily use. Nearly every other Chinese product I've purchases has failed within a week or two. This one has an added feature I really like, a simple rheostat on the side to adjust the sensitivity of wireless signal detection, plus LED and signal strength meter. My $500 model from Brickhouse Security was always giving false alerts on stray signals I couldn't filter out, and I never knew the distance or direction the signal was coming from (this one has a compass on it as well. Tiny, but useful when chasing hidden signals).It has other features the high dollar model doesn't. In addition to earphones, it can be set to vibrate. This is excellent when you are scanning hotels, cars in public view, or other things you don't need nosy people asking about while you are helping your customers or law enforcement. Another benefit over my overpriced unit, the red LED's used to detect camera lenses (that aren't wireless), the flash speed can be adjusted also. This is better for time lapsed cameras that open and close the lenses openings (like critter cameras, motion photo cameras, etc.).Using this cheap model (that also comes with rechargeable batteries and AC adapter)has helped me spend less time chasing down false alerts on things that aren't there. Just in recent weeks, I've located one GPS tracker on a car and several \"Voyeur\" cameras set up with client's vehicles or private areas (locker rooms, bathrooms, showers) in less time than usual. It is also much smaller than my commercial unit, thus making it easy to carry in a shirt or pants pocket unnoticed.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Missing Pieces", "Author": "Quixotic", "ReviewID": "R33R0BIPFFK8B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let me be clear that the retailer I dealt with was very polite and prompt in dealing with the problems I had with this device, but my suspicion is that it is a serious manufacturing problem with the AGPtek bug detector that caused the difficulties.My device arrived without the little bit of glass that should be in the window. If you look at the device as it is pictured there is a red circle at the top by the antenna, on the back are a set of LEDs placed around the window. The idea is you activate the LEDS and then walk into a room, look through the little red piece of glass while the LEDS are flashing. If there is a spy camera set up somewhere, you'll be able to see the recording light as a particularly large, bright red object. Since mine was completely missing the glass there was no way to use this as a surveillance camera detector.The radio signal detector is supposed to work by turning the dial from 'off' to either auditory detect or vibrate detect. You scan by using the scrolling button on the right side to increase the range of waves you are monitoring and the little LEDS on the FRONT of the device should turn red as you scan. If you detect something the device should either vibrate differently or let off a different sound. Mine got stuck. It would get stuck in between LED settings and noise settings. I've tested it using a cell phone, a recording device, and in an open space away from any possible bugging equipment. It makes exactly the same sounds at all times, and the LEDS do not function properly.Now I think I just received a faulty item, but I'm not sure. I've since taken care of my scanning needs in another way. If you receive a device without glass and without changing settings, you have a broken item. If you receive a device that works, the instructions will make you giggle. They are oddest translation of the original Chinese imaginable. I strongly suggest watching one of the Youtube instructional videos on how to use the AGPtek. It'll explain everything you need.Again, if this thing had worked, it would have been perfect, but I don't know if I received the only broken device, or if this is a shoddy line of product.

Amazingly I've actually found many things that set off this device.  I did find hidden cameras from the reflective RED LEDs using the scope.  The lenses of the hidden camera reflects the light.  Somehow the scope helps see that.  Go figure.The vibrating mode to find hidden wall devices works as well.  Kind of like a metal detector.  You hold it to a wall and swipe back and forth the vibrating is steady until a signal is detected where your device will begin signalling you with a stronger vibration and light meter all lit up.Kind of creepy too because a few times when ghosts were being announced as being present the meter shot up and beeped like crazy.  Of course we took it like some rogue signal pass by.  We couldn't get that same signal later, in the same area.Cool device to have though.", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product to detect bugs", "Author": "Roy Muranaka", "ReviewID": "R1ABXJG55V9505", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Detects audio and video bugs very good and easy to use with clear instructions.

I did not want to spend several hundred dollars on a detector.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  It's inexpensive, works, and is fun to play with.First, camera detection.  It shows cameras that are pointing at the detector as a bright pinpoint of light.  It worked on my cell phone, webcam, and 3ds cameras which were all pinhole types.  I did not have any other kinds to test on it.  One thing to note, it's viewable from across a room but it's not an incredibly bright light.  You may not notice it if you're looking for a hidden camera and it's surrounded by reflective surfaces. This was an extra feature I wasn't looking for in an rf detector but I love it.  Just this function itself could have sold it for me.For rf detection it works.  I've tested it on remote controls for remote control cars,  wireless video game controllers, my remote car lock/unlock thing, my cell phone, and my wireless router and it can detect them all. It's detection range is short though, about a foot.  This may be due to background noise or that just might be the range of the detector.  It only detects signals being sent, so it won't detect a phone until it tries to make a call.  It won't detect things like television remotes since they use ir instead of rf.  For the price I'm loving it.The instructions are in broken English.  You will only get a vague idea of what to do with it.  I did not see that as an issue since it's fairly simple and strait forward and I do not normally read instructions.  I did read this however since several other posts had mentioned it. You got a power switch that can select between mute/vibrate and unmute/tone.  A button for the forward LED's for the camera detector.  Push the button and you can see the LEDs light up and you look through the glass lens part.  And finally a sensitivity adjustment on the side.  If it were more complicated then a lack of clear instructions would be a huge issue, but as it is I had no problems.The compass is a cheap addition.  It really would have been better with no compass at all.  It does not align itself north.  When you go into a camping section and look at an array of compasses and there's the fifty cent ones in a bin at the end where you assume several are only pointing north because some have to point that way out of pure chance that would be the compass this has.  I do have to say to it's credit it does point to magnets that are close, but relying on it in the woods would be asking to get lost.For one last note, on the LED button it is labeled laser.  I'm going to chalk this one up to poor translation.Would I use this if I ever thought someone put hidden cameras or other things in my house?  It would work, though for something like that I'd actually fork out the money for a higher quality detector.Overall I love this.  It works.  It has an extra part that also works and is a joy to mess with.  The issues are minor enough that I can overlook them for the price.  Especially in comparison to other items that cost hundreds.", "Date": "July 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works great!", "Author": "Colleen Coffman", "ReviewID": "R32265M9FWUWQK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Found the hidden camera at my job  instantly!
