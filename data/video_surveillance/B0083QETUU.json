In fact, after my purchase another user who posted a review reported difficulty achieving a range of 125 feet (see the reviews of this device, the reviewer is \"John\"). After spending an additional $32 on high-gain antenna's, he achieved good results (according to his review). For me, I wasn't willing to spend another $30+ dollars, so I quit while I was ahead.So, let's proceed with the review, shall we?PROS:- Professionally designed and well constructed; clearly a solidly designed product.- In short range, video transmits very well- When returned for poor range, the seller *did* refund shipping cost to me (unusual and noteworthy)CONS:- Short or long range, the audio is out-of-sync of the video. Why? Can you imagine if your video from this device was the major argument in a legal proceeding and the flash of the gun muzzle didn't match the sound of the \"pop\"? Analog transmission devices don't have this \"problem\"- The range is far less than purported (and if you don't believe me, see the other reviewer). I'm not sure why this is the case, but I have my suspicions; I suspect this device uses the same frequencies in the range of 2.4ghz; the same used by your local wireless network and all of your neighbors. Obviously, interference from other networks will impact the range of this device.- Weird quirks: * The ad on Amazon states \"Includes cigarette charger\", but no such device was included with the product * You can buy the same device on the most popular auction website if you search for \"HQ-Cam converter\", and you'll get a result of this device for $140 (a savings from buying off Amazon of $60). Why buy on Amazon???- Prior to providing an RMA for returning the product, the seller asked the following questions: (a) Is there any big machines (e.g. big air condition)? (b) {Is there any} signal tower affect the wireless signal? Both questions are ridiculous, as I cannot ask my local power company or cell carrier to move their equipment because of interference.Bottom line: Another user achieved good results with the purchase of enhanced antenna's, so I would NEVER discredit the capabilities of this product. In my case, I was only able to achieve 2 {sometimes 3} bars of signal, which means that the video was horribly compressed (digitally) and unrecognizable. For the purposes of surveillance camera's, this is not acceptable.So if, like me you can achieve assurance that should the item not perform as described you'll get a full refund (including shipping to you), then I would say go for it.On the other hand, you'll have to admit up front that you might have to throw away $14 on shipping the item back to them if it doesn't work as they propose. Is that OK with you? That's only something you can decide.PS: I've instead gone with a purely analog transmitter/receiver set that not only covers the range I need (for about the same price), but none of the BS with this device.Good product, but not for me.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0083QETUU"}}
