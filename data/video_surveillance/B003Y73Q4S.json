{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not for us", "Author": "Sophia Burns", "ReviewID": "R2TAECCJ82WO15", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My husband and I live on a 16 acre paradise. Because we are so \"remote\", we felt we needed a security camera system around our house. After reading up on different systems, we settled for this one. Reasons: it is wireless, records motion, has night vision, and has its own portable monitor. We thought it would suffice, but in fact, we sent it back to Amazon within a week.Let's be clear: we are sure this system is perfect for others, it just wasn't for us. Here is a summation of our reasons:- Our drive is about 24ft from the house. Although it still sees cars at that distance, the motion sensor only works up to 20 feet for any visitors on foot. Meaning that only if they are (un)kind enough to walk on the grass instead of the drive, the camera would detect them. Moving the camera closer to the drive was not option, so any pedestrians can easily pass the house undetected.- The clarity of the system was certainly not sufficient for our use. Beyond 10, 15ft, simply nothing is recognizable. My husband saw me walk by and did not even know me!- The colors are so washed out and/or distorted, that it is impossible to determine what color an object is. Green grass looks like it covered in snow, and you can't tell the color of people's clothing or cars.- The field of view is rather poor, compared with the system we recently purchased. Our new system can view up to 130 degrees per camera, and the Defender cameras only around 64 or so. We'd need three cameras just to monitor the front of the house, while now we can use 2 cameras to cover the full front and part of one side.- The recording is so slow to kick in, that a car driving by at 30km/h is already 3/4 past the camera before it is recorded. Our new system has some sort of buffer that back-records from the moment the motion starts... thus catching the full motion from start to finish.- Although I mention this last, in fact this is almost our biggest concern. Living in the Rockies, we have frequent power outages. To our dismay, the system does not come back after an outage, it says off until you manually push the power button. When we are away, any glitch in the power means our system is useless until we get back.We are not putting down the product, it was just not sufficient for our needs. The advertising images were graphically rather misleading and the motion detection range is not mentioned anywhere, otherwise we would never have considered this system. We can certainly see how it may be suitable for people who make use of it as an intercom system, such as in an apartment building or office.However, if one is looking for high definition, long distance outdoor usage, we would strongly recommend the Logitech Alert system. It is extremely easy to set up, does not require additional cable setups, allows for remote monitoring over the Internet (and thus all your computers and mobile devices). It has flexible and excellent motion detection. The image quality and colors are superb. The system appears to be more pricey, especially with additional cameras, but in our opinion, it is more than worth the difference.As long term customers this is the first time that we returned a product. We were hoping to order the Logitech system instead, but sadly Amazon Canada does not stock the product and Amazon USA does not ship to Canada, so we purchased it from another company.", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Easy to Use Home Security Night Vision System", "Author": "William B. Dwinnell IV", "ReviewID": "RD758YACSIGX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a home security camera system which is easy enough for an average person with a few tools to install.  Included are: a monitoring station with a 7-inch diagonal color screen, one night-vision camera, a remote control (for the monitoring station) and mounting hardware.Note that this is an \"active\" infrared system, meaning that it requires infrared lighting to see in the dark.  Infrared lighting is provided on this camera by LED lamps surrounding the camera lens.Note:- Monitoring station and camera are powered by AC adapters (supplied).- Cameras may be connected by video cable or wireless.- This system includes an audio intercom function.- Video feed can be piped from the monitoring station to other devices (TV, etc.)- Monitoring station permits up to 4 cameras to be attached, and can roll through them or display a 2x2 matrix of images.Good:- Camera provides an image of sufficient quality for security purposes.  If someone you knew walked into the field of view, you would be able to recognize them.- Setting this system up was exceedingly easy.- Video recording to SD card is possible.  One SD card is included.- Night vision function works well.- Infrared lighting was more than ample to light subjects at the advertised 40 foot distance.- Wireless hook-up between monitoring station and camera is quick and, in my testing, automatic.  Note that the documentation indicates that it may be necessary to \"sync\" the devices, which should not be hard.- Wireless connection works well, even through approx. 100 feet of wooden-construction house.- Monitoring station is configured via a simple menu system.Bad:- Monitoring station's menu system could be more comprehensive.  (I would have liked to turn down the contrast in the daytime.)Pay Attention:- The camera housing is \"water resistant\", but not weather proof.  I imagine that a reasonably sheltered mounting location (inside a car port, underneath a deep roof overhang), should sufficiently protect the camera.  Just realize that it is not designed to sit out in the rain.- Daytime vision was nearly colorless in my experience.- Infrared LED lamps will create glare on windows and nearby objects, so window glass cannot be between the camera and its subject during infrared operation, and bushes, etc. should not be too near lamps or their \"glow\" will partially obscure the scene.Overall, I found this to be a good quality product, which was very easy to set up.  The camera provides a reasonable viewing angle and depth of focus for security purposes.  Using the system was also quite easy.  Assuming you avoid the few potential \"gotchas\", this would be an easy way to set up video surveillance system for a home or small business.Privacy Note: One thing I was not able to determine was how hard it would be for anyone else to intercept the wireless video feed from these cameras.", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not a very good value for the money.", "Author": "J. Musto \"Toolman Joe\"", "ReviewID": "RNRFR160UVP6U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Despite many good reviews, I was not overly impressed.  This system has a lot of great features but the overall implementation is poor.Features:* 2 Way intercom - You can mount this by your front door and talk with visitors before you let them in.* Motion detector - Unit alarms and starts recording when it detects motion.* Included SD card - Yes, it is small but it is included.  You can always upgrade to a larger card.* Metal camera housing with mount - The camera looks like a quality security camera.  Another reviewer said it is not meant to sit in the rain but I'm not so sure.  It looks like it would handle the weather just fine.* Expandable - You can add up to 3 additional cameras.* Night vision with IR illuminator - It can see in total darkness.  The infrared illuminator was pretty bright but cannot be seen by the naked eye.* Pretty easy to setup and use.* Included remote control.Now for the bad:* Video quality is poor - At first, I thought this might be caused by the LCD monitor but even when plugged into an external, high quality monitor, the video is pretty bad.  The resolution is low and the frame rate is poor.  Images are not sharp and motion causes highly visible blurring.  Color is also poor.  I suspect the IR illuminator is partially to blame.  Even in good lighting, colors are washed out.  As you get closer to the camera, colors pretty much disappear.  To visualize the effect, turn the color control all the way down on your TV then turn it up until you can just barely discern some color.  That is what the image looks like on this system.  My cheap x10 camera system has much better video quality than this and it is way cheaper (1/5th the price).  Since this is the basic functionality, I had to lower the rating significantly because of the poor video quality.* Poorly implemented night vision.  As previously mentioned, the IR emitters are always on so they distort the color.  If you are anywhere near the camera, you get virtually no color even with good lighting.* You cannot view images on the LCD monitor and an external monitor simultaneously.  If you want to be able to monitor from multiple locations, you will need a second receive/monitor.  I am not sure if the system lets you sync multiple monitors to a single camera.* The LCD monitor itself is rather cheap and slides around easily on the table.  I'd rather have just a receiver that plugs into the TV than a monitor that is so cheesy.  Sorry but that's the truth.* Price - You can do much better for the money.  Additional cameras are about $100 if you can find them.  So if you fully load this system, you will end up paying close to $600.  You can get a system with a real monitor and real DVR for that.", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing Security System without Sticker Shock", "Author": "Matthew Keefe \"mkeefe\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZA4QQS0U3BSX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Defender wireless video surveillance system is an out-of-the-box solution with a small price tag. However don't be afraid that the lower price means cheap because this system is packed with many abilities and features. One of the most interesting features is the 40 foot night-vision range the camera can achieve, this allows you to monitor an entire backyard, large office or garage.Right now I have it installed in the office watching one of the workstations to ensure unauthorized users don't access anything. The included SD card allows recording of up to 350 minutes consisting of full audio and video. The included wireless 7 inch monitor can also be hooked up to an external A/V system with the included cables.Another rather interesting feature of the system is the ability to have a 2-way conversation through the monitor and camera. This is a neat feature if the surveillance system is being used outside of a doorway. Basically the motion of a visitor will trigger the recorder and notify you even before they press the door bell. Then once you establish identity you have the opportunity to ask what they want before even opening the door, for added security.In the box you get a camera, viewer, remote, video cables and power packs. The camera can be placed indoors or outdoors and has a weather resistant housing for even more options when mounting on your property. You could mount it on the roof, in a tree or behind a glass window, the choice is yours.The 7-inch viewer has a few options to help customize your use. For one you can set up automatic recording based on time of day or motion. The system will notify with an audible tone anytime the motion sensor is triggered, but for stealth use you can change the volume of this feature. The viewer also has a DVR system included where you can view previous recordings located on the SD card.Overall I am very pleased with the system, the hardware is durable and the advantage of wireless and plug-n-play will quickly be noticed. For one, it took roughly 3 minutes to completely un-box and have a video signal being displayed. Now I plan to pick up a few more cameras as the viewer can have up to 4 cameras and even has a quad viewer to quickly monitor all four locations. In all this system is a cost effective surveillance solution with a bunch of very useful features and abilities.If you are looking for a great surveillance solution without spending a fortune then the Defender Digital Wireless DVR Security System is for you.", "Date": "September 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Would not recommend this", "Author": "Bottle Lady", "ReviewID": "R3DE516CKBOQIW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Had this product in service less than one week. Would not work one hundred feet away as avertised. Did not work as instructions stated (when in screen saver mode it would not record). Set timer to record at a scheduled time, worked for two days then started recording 24 hrs. a day by itself. It powered itself down. When I tried to go into the main menu to see why it changed it would not power up. The joystick control knob fell off. I have sent four e-mails to the company to try to get this system repaired or replaced and they have not responded to any of them only to issue me a complaint number. I AM VERY DISPLEASED WITH THIS SYSTEM AND THE COMPANY WHO BOOST THAT THEY TAKE QUALITY VERY SERIOUSLY ON THEIR WEB SITE.

Dent \"Aragorn\"", "ReviewID": "R2GUXFSDC9IONQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Defender's Digital Wireless DVR Security System with receiver... etc., etc., if set up properly can and will record any movement within the camera view, day or night. The receiver can be connected to any device that accepts RCA video and audio inputs and it will produce an audible warning/alarm when motion is detected. The receiver can wirelessly control up to 4 cameras (one camera included) and, in turn, can be operated by the provided IR remote control.I wish I could say 'for sure' that this is a bad product or that it's an Okay thing - the difference between 2 and 3 stars - but I can't. I will settle for 2 stars at this time but I am open to any new facts or corrections that would warrant one extra star.KIT CONTENTSIn the box, you will find the camera, the receiver, power adapters for both, RCA wire with plugs for video and mono audio, an IR extension wire, 4 window stickers announcing that the property is protected and the manual.INSTALLATION AND SETUPI was disappointed to learn that  the only way you can connect to a TV/monitor is over an ANALOG RCA interface - quite unexpected from a product that calls itself 'digital'. Our living room TV has 3 HDMI ports, 2 component video banks and the traditional coax for inputs. NO 'yellow' RCA for Video In. The solution was to go through a receiver and from 'it' to TV's 'component analog video' but I expected better and less complicated.After that, the rest of the setup was quick and easy. The camera paired with the receiver automatically, the 2GB SD card was inserted into its slot, went through a couple of menus to set preferences and we were up and running.We haven't mounted the camera on a wall yet but everything needed appears to be there: mounting screws, bracket, even drilling templates.FEATURESThe Defender (I will use this as the short name from now on) is advertised as an advanced, versatile, easy to operate security solution. I will briefly list its most important (to me) features and compare 'advertised' vs. my reality/experience.- Optimal range of up to 100 ft. between receiver and camera - I placed the right outside the house with the receiver in the living room, easily less than 50 ft. between the two. I was surprised to notice that, even at this short distance the signal's strength will drop to 2 bars and occasionally drop altogether. Moving the receiver a few inches right or left or changing the antenna's position from vertical to horizontal would sometimes get me 3 or 4 bars. As a frame of reference, I have no reception problems whatsoever anywhere in the house or around the house with my DECT cordless phones or with my Wi-Fi. This is at odds with the advertised claim of 100 ft. combined with the claim that the system will intelligently search for and find some unused radio spectrum to use.- Night vision at up to 40 ft - I am happy to confirm that this is indeed the case. On a moonless night I was able to watch activity (our dogs that is) up to 40-50 ft. from camera's location. It should be noted that the 'infrared' LEDs do have a visible dark red glow so this can't be a stealth night surveillance camera.- Color camera - I can't tell if this is my receiver's inability to properly translate the one-channel analog RCA feed into 'component video' sent to the TV but what I get on my TV is honest to goodness black and white. This is strange because the recordings captured on the SD card are very much 'color' so either somewhere inside the Defender's own receiver or, possibly, inside my own, the picture turns to B&W.; Strange.- Clear sound and crisp image - No complaints about the microphone. The picture resolution is 640x480 (VGA) by default but you can take it down to 320x240 if you want. To me, the 'hi res' is barely adequate. In addition, the frame rate seems to be something in the range of 10-20 frames per second.- Coverage - It should be clear that this camera does NOT move (it's fixed in one position) and the only 'zoom' capability is a so-called fixed 2X 'digital zoom' which isn't real any zoom at all because you aren't getting any extra detail.- Motion detection - Check. It will detect motion up to 100 ft.- Motion-triggered recording - It works but there seems to be a delay of about one second between the moment motion was detected and the start of the recording. Somewhat annoyingly, the screen goes blank for one second upon motion detection if you happen to watch this 'live'. In addition, if you set your camera to record for 5 seconds following the detection of motion, the recording will stop after 5 seconds while the motion continued. You can set the recording time to 15 or 30 seconds following detection though so this is no such a big deal.- DVR capability - Indeed, the DS card will have folders named after the date YYMMDD and inside each folders you will have .AVI recordings labeled by 'time' HHMMSS' that can be easily played with MS's Media Player or just about any other app that plays video. You can set it to overwrite the oldest records when full so the 2GB card should get you several days, probably many days of motion activate records.- Weather resistant - I believe the specs state a temp range from 14F-116F. The temps do drop to and below zero where we live. I hope nothing bad will happen to the camera when this happens. Other than that, it comes with a aluminum cover and, since it tends to run pretty hot, I would expect for ice and snow to melt quickly off it.- Up to 4 cameras supported - Could not test that but the menus suggest that you could have all 4 camera feeds on one screen at the same time.OPERATIONWe set the camera up outside to overlook the driveway and to start recording whenever motion was detected. Once we found a good position for the receiver where it would consistently get at least 2 bars of signal strength, the camera operated well, doing what was expected of it, seeing through the night, detecting and recording motion until... we closed the garage door at which time the receiver could no longer communicate with our camera, located about 50 ft. away, outside. Opening the door would restore communication but we are not planning to keep the garage door permanently open. Raising the camera - me holding it above my head - restored communication while the garage door was closed but this is not a long-term solution. We are still debating what to do with the camera at this time, like maybe mount it somewhere high, possibly on the roof. I can think of a mode of operation where the receiver isn't connected to any display and, if you only interest is to see who came near the house, you simply take out the DS card and watch the daily records independently.The best use for this camera, if you aren't home during the day, is to be able to see who happened to be around the house in your absence. With 15 seconds of recording per detected motion all it takes is just a few minutes to 'see' the daily activity. I wish we had something like this a couple of months ago when, while we were on vacation, a package left for us in the driveway... disappeared.RATING+ Good, almost great, DVR functions+ Relatively simple easy setup+ Night vision as advertised+ Motion detection and motion-activated recording as advertised- Range grossly overstated- Terrible, antiquated analog interface to TV/monitor- Low resolution, low frame rateWhile this product comes with many good and useful capabilities, the shortcomings are quite serious - so serious, we are not sure we are going to actually 'use' it, now that the testing is done. Considering that this product isn't exactly 'cheap', while I still hesitate between 2 and 3 stars, I feel compelled to award it 2 stars.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! <<", "Date": "September 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Up to you to find parts", "Author": "richard phillips", "ReviewID": "R3H5K5FJSWCEMZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought the wireless PX301 camera system, but Defender told me that the extesnion cable (if you need to locate the camera more than 6ft from power source) to go to a electronic store since Defender does not offer it for this particular system; that would be fine but all the stores that I went to says it is not available and I would need to get it from the mfg.

That's why I bought the system with two cameras.  First of all, it's the easiest thing ever to get started right away!  Simply plug in the cameras.  Plug in the monitor. Then you're all set.  SOOO easy!  Very good quality, too.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I am happy with my purchase, but I have already found three downfalls on this system: I have two cameras, so I'd like to split the 7\" screen in half to see both, but it only allows \"quad\" viewing (quarters each picture, even if you only have two cameras, rather than four).  Second downfall is that when you choose the \"zoom\" option, it applies to \"all or none\" (i.e. you can't have one camera zoomed closer for a small room (my daughter's bedroom), and the other zoomed further out (for outside on the driveway)).  It's either both or neither.  The third downfall is that I wish the monitor accepted batteries, instead of needing to be plugged in.  It would be nice to be able to take the monitor with me sometimes while I change rooms, but it's more cumbersome since it ONLY works when it's plugged in, so now I've got to unplug it, then plug it back in when I go up to bed, then again in the morning when I come back down.Also, two things were wrong when I received the item.  First is that it came without the SD card (it was nowhere to be found in the packaging).

I bought it for the \"Long-range\" capability and wireless cameras. I was disappointed. Resolution was worse than $10 kids toy cameras. Resolution was so bad that I could not get facial recognition any farther than 3 feet away from the camera. At the listed range of 40 feet you can't tell the make of a car. I will try to post a video and/or photos to illustrate. On my old 19\" monitor the native video is about 3.5 inches diagonally (uber-tiny). When expanded to full-screen (or even half-screen) the video is pixelated and terrible. I would guess night mode frame rate to be about 2-3 frames per second and daytime to be about 12. For $200+ I can get a lot better DVR and cameras. I will not buy this brand again. I recommend you DON'T BUY this.Also color is altered significantly by the fact that the IR switches to night mode in anything but direct full sunlight (meaning you will only get B/W video in most houses unless you have laboratory-bright lighting.)One good thing is the IR lighting is actually very bright. I could see the effects of the light about twenty feet away (although resolution did not allow me to see details even with the light). The bad thing is that the light is so bright that is completely washes out any detail at close range (which is the only rage at which you can see detail due to such poor resolution.)I'll update with a better review if I am able to enhance the video or the company replaces the unit with a reasonable product.The video attached is at maximum resolution and not shrunk by Amazon. That is as good as it gets. Make it full-screen to see what the camera can do (or not do). This was taken under ideal daylight conditions with the receiver less than ten feet from the camera for best possible picture.The claim long-range fails in my opinion for two reasons.1. The wireless cameras will not work in the open at 450 feet as claimed. Effective range in the open was about 150feet. In my house the unit did work through walls and floors just fine, but that is not \"long range\" as claimed.2. The cameras can't be used for any details past about 3 feet because resolution is so poor. I'm not being picky. The resolution is crappier than the video camera on my son's remote control car which cost a fraction of this system.", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great surveillance system", "Author": "KM", "ReviewID": "R3VVHA15H07XKZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The defender wireless security system has performed outstandingly so far.

Very disappointed to find that out in the instruction manual AFTER the purchase.  I don't remember seeing any reference to that little tidbit of info in the manufacturers write-up on Amazon.  My wife has been attacked twice by our neighbor's loose pit-bull while she was walking our dogs on leashes in front of our home.

Green", "ReviewID": "RWHTIWFLQBP09", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Due to my wife's excellent decorating taste and landscaping skills our house looks like I make a LOT more money than I actually do.  This certainly isn't something to complain about, but it does make me worry that thieves might imagine my house a good target (of course, they won't find the loot they might expect).  So, a security camera seems like a good idea.Installation was a cinch once I found a location with close access to an electrical outlet and a view of most of the front yard (we have a long ranch-style house, so multiple cameras would have been a better idea than just one in my case - and the camera itself does not move).  It also needed to be somewhat sheltered from the elements as the camera is water-resistant but not water-proof.  The receiving unit is wireless so it only needs to be located within 100ft of the camera which wasn't difficult in my case.  It can be connected to a TV (I ran it through the DVD player) with RCA style connectors, but I would have preferred a USB connection to connect with a computer.  But it comes with an SD card for recording which can be inserted into the computer to view pre-recorded data.  I also want to note that the receiving unit need not be connected to anything at all since it will record on the SD card - a nice feature that would allow you to hide it from a burglar, thus keeping your video record safer.The video from the camera is color, but appears almost b&w; when viewed on the television (it looks better on the SD card and viewed on the computer).  It's not as clear as I'd like, but I'm also using it in a much larger setting than would be optimal.  I set it up to record based upon motion detection (you can also set to record at specific times), and although there's a slight delay of about a second before it starts recording it works pretty well.  Large trucks rumbling by on the street (and the awful ear-splitting Harley Davidson motorcycles) will start it recording as well, so I ended up with a lot of unnecessary clips of the driveway and yard.  The receiving unit can be set to beep (my wife described it as the \"Psycho\" noise) when it detects motion which is another nice feature which me and the kids have used as an alert that mom is home and we need to help unload groceries.  The volume on the beeping noise can be adjusted or turned off completely.  The night vision also works quite well (the red LEDs for the infra-red are easily visible at night - a potential small negative).  One last feature I wish to mention is the microphone on the camera - I could hear my kids riding skateboards and saying \"hi dad\" very well.This is a nice and easy to install system - I just hope it doesn't add to the impression from the street that we've got more to protect than we actually do.", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect for basic home monitoring and theft deterence!", "Author": "W.

The price of the other dvr security systems was ridiculous. I bought the PX301 from Amazon and got it in three days. It was very easy to set up. I could not get it to record. I had it hooked to my tv input, and everything was working fine live, no recording to the SD card. I contacted on line tech support (I like live chat as good as phone calls) and got instant chat service. Unfortunately before I got the answer, the power went down for a few seconds on my end and I lost the connection. I finally figured out the issue on my own.Even if you set the camera to record on motion, YOU MUST SELECT AUTOMATIC RECORDING on the receiver also by pushing the button where it says \"Recording Auto\" (you can start recording yourself by pushing the manual record button on the receiver), and it will light up. Works great now. I also purchased a 16GB SD card ($14.95) for 8 times the OEM recording time before full or being erased. I set it to NOT erase.Remember, since it stops recording after the time you sent, and each start is triggered by motion, a 16 GB card could last up to months depending on how much motion there is near the camera. The card is in the receiver, not the camera, and is real easy to get to.Everything you need comes with the system including a 2 GB SD card good for 350 minutes at the lower resolution 320X240 (640X480 is the highest but that is all you really need). Picture (color) and sound is good especially for the money. Not HD of course, but good enough to identify someone. The camera has an aluminum body and is very sturdy and well built. With the power cord for the camera, and the adapter cord, you have enough power cord to reach an outlet from the camera almost anywhere. I am guessing the combined length is about 14 feet. The camera found the receiver instantly and automatically. The mounting bracket for the camera is very strong and adjustable, and it comes with paper templates for screws if you need a template. You do not really need a computer or card reader to view recorded videos. If you hook the receiver up to any TV or monitor with RCA inputs (including an almost brand new 12\" color TV with RCA inputs in the back from Goodwill for $5.00) you can do EVERYTHING from the receiver. I hooked it up for setup on my 40\" flat screen. You can select the video (each recording event is arranged by date and time and has its own file), you can watch the video, rewind, etc. etc. (using the supplied remote or receiver keypad and on screen menu), set up record time after activated by motion ( 5 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds). You can select \"view split screen\" if you have multiple cameras. Delete videos and format the card is easy too. Of course any movement starts recording again. Since it stops after a max of 30 seconds with no additional movement, you could actually record a 7 hour+ event with the included SD card. I like the time limit feature since wild animals and dear roam where the camera will be aimed. I don't want to use up all the recording on that. The on screen menu is SUPER easy to use with giant icons. I would say the menu is easier to use than any TV remote or the old VCR menus I've seen.You can hide the receiver inside your home or business where it is safe from the elements and destruction by an intruder, all you need is an outlet within 6 feet for electrical power to the adapter (9Volts). You can also mount the receiver where you can easily get to it and start/stop recording manually by simply pushing a button. The receiver makes a chirping sound (about three times then stops) as an alarm, when it starts recording, and you can adjust the volume from none to pretty loud. I tried to get past the motion detector, but was unable to not get caught. Once mounted, the receiver actually looks like the control panel for an alarm system with all the lights etc. The camera and receiver did not seem to get hot while powered up as some products do. I don't know about the 100 ft. range since my camera is only 40 feet from the receiver and it works fine. The manufacturer suggests for the best angle and coverage that the camera is mounted about 12 -14 feet in the air, and that works out perfect for where I mounted it. Of course you can place it on a table top or hide it if you want to as an inside camera to monitor what someone might be doing while you are not in your house (make sure it is legal first. Don't do anything stupid with the camera). Wireless cannot be beat.There is another version of this product for more money that includes the same stuff built into a 7\" LCD color monitor. That is too small for me, I like this setup better. The 7\" monitor would be useless to me. I also like the receiver key pad design better.The entire system appears to be high quality and well constructed. I was glad I do not need to remove the SD card and take it to my computer to view. If I want to print a pic, or make a video copy, I can use my computer card reader then.I like this system a lot, it is actually better than I thought it would be for the price. It would also make a good system for a small business. The designers seem to have thought out the design really well. I will be purchasing a second camera in the future for the cottage, and a second system for inside my main residence (I already have an alarm system, but video would be great). Sure the alarm calls the cops, but if there is no video of the person, the intruder usually gets away.", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "indispensable", "Author": "taxt", "ReviewID": "R227SIUTJM1WSC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Negatives:*Limited to only four cameras*The buttons are too small and clumsy, hard to use if you get in a hurry.*Tiny screen won't let you see enough detail at times.*The cords that plug into the monitors have a big \"lump\" right where you need to be able to set the camera on the table or shelf, whatever, have to be extra careful to set it securely, would be better if it was out of the way.*Having to have each camera and each monitor plugged in to an outlet; true wireless would be better.*No battery backup.Positives:*Easy enough software.*Good to have sound and mic where you can hear trespassers (or whatever) and warn them to leave without having to go out physically.*Easy enough to mount, though some placements require two people when the cameras have to be paired.*It doesn't get any easier than the SD cards for recording.*They'll record things at too far a distance for the auto record to come on, just have to hustle to get the right buttons pushed.Bottom line, I would not want to ever have to do without a security system and I have yet to find one better than this for the price.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "So limited in capability it's worthless", "Author": "Brian Belhumeur", "ReviewID": "RLEXUOC0EV9HN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The hardware of this system seems low grade.

It has every feature I ever wanted and then some. It has long range, night vision, a 2 way intercom, a DVR that records up to 350 minutes of video and audio (love the motion activating feature), a weather resistant camera, and a nice 7'' LCD screen.There has been some weird stuff happening late at night around the outside of the house over the years. Mysterious items being left on the front porch, doorbells being rung with nobody in sight, and worst of all, a few years ago, an older man wandered into the garage late one night, that was accidently left open. I stumbled upon him by chance when I was taking out th trash. I slammed the door leading to the garage and called the police. Even though the police came that night to check everything out (he was long gone), it would have been nice to have recorded evidence that the stranger actually left the area. I didn't sleep too well that night. If I had this setup then, at least I would have known exactly what he looked like and how long he was there.You are not limited to using this for outdoor purposes only. It would work great in an secure work environment, maybe to let employees in at the start of the work day or lunch. Or perhaps just to keep an eye on young children in the house, though you can find less expensive models for that. Seeing stories on TV about home security cameras catching the identities of robbers while people are away on vacation is evidence enough to show just how valuable these things are.The only negative is that you only get one camera (some cheaper sets come with multiple), but you can add up to three additional ones if you have the money.Overall, this is an outstanding product that is well built, easy to use, and might help you sleep a little better at night.", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Defender", "Author": "kath", "ReviewID": "RZK0IZNCCJJVT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "easy to install, easy to operate,but not happy with picture clarity and signal distance.

All features worked as advertised (video is recorded in AVI format) and I was able to monitor the remote camera more than 100 feet away (from back of house to the front).I did not test this system with multiple cameras.However, no system is perfect, and I do have a few beefs:- detailed specifications are lacking; there is no indication of the maximum size SDHC storage supported- only two recording resolutions are available- the mini-joystick is too small, causing inadvertent, erroneous menu exits- the camera is not weatherproofed, and there is no way the SMA antenna connector will remain corrosion free in my local weather- the camera's power cord is a 7-foot pigtail that simply exits the camera body - this makes for an awkward install- the camera's pigtail connector has a diameter three times the pigtail's diameter - this means an unnecessarily larger hole for installs- you are limited to a 15-foot power connection for the camera (unless you plug the wall-wart into an extension cord)- this system's use as an intercom is extremely limited, as the camera's speaker is quite small with tinny output- the Web page did not offer any hints, tips or other detailed information about the system- a power outage will reset the date and time - not a good thing in my area w/its frequent outagesYour biggest problem will be finding an outlet for camera power with this system. And before I do my install, I'll need to build a weatherproof box for the camera - it will cease to function after several months due to the salt air in my locale.", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent home security system", "Author": "J. garcia", "ReviewID": "R2IE9K2EMGR2FQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The wireless security system by Defender is overall an excellent system and bargain.

I've had vandals and theft outside the house in the past.Note:  Have AT&T; wireless in the house.  Due to this device's hopping frequency, I've had NO or zero interference whatsoever as stated in another write-up.  I have about full 5 bars showing on the monitor.  Good frequency reception between the monitor & camera from the 100 feet or so where I will be using this device.Monitor:  Works right off the bat when plugged in.  One thing that bugged me is that buttons on the monitor usually required \"pressing\" more than once to switch to another mode you currently want.  The monitor is only as good as the quality broadcasted by the video cameras.  Highest camera recording resolution is 480X640; this I recall is something off the dark ages or 1st generation digital cameras.  I personally think it's about 98+% on the grayish side with a hint of occasional color.  Clarity is also generally non-existent unless the subject is stationary and within or less than 10 feet from the camera.  I did check the SD card, video recorded file, in my laptop using Windows Movie Maker.  You can then somewhat and very minimally adjust the recorded brightness to view any dark recorded scenes, but the blurriness is as is.Video Cameras:  Looks sturdy.  Camera pairing, if required, is just a matter of pressing the monitor menu screen and a camera button in the back.  Motion detection sensor is not instantaneous, but works fairly quickly.  I tested the camera outside & quickly recorded the neighborhood kid's movements on their skateboards from about maybe 25-30 feet away.  I did notice that the motion sensor is fairly straight lined; it has to have a direct hit on the subject to activate, instead of having a wider motion detection field.  I do luv the Camera/Monitor audio capability.  Anybody standing outside within a close distance, say by the front door, can speak up & your screen turns on, when on screensaver mode, for you to hear them on the monitor.  Return talk response is just a button push on the monitor.  (The Defender web site has recorded video samples so you can judge for yourself the true, actual, visual quality rendition of this device!.  This is just about what I'm getting.)Overall:  For my personal use and considering I wasn't buying a Hubble telescope, it's ample for visual & audio surveillance.  This or just not have any surveillance device at all.Install:  This should be the challenge considering I need to hookup the 2 cameras outside the house.  With the camera hookup comes the usual bulky extension adapters that requires an outlet to plug into, not to mention having the recommended surge protector.  I have to put my thinking cap on, like say, maybe hanging Xmas lights around homes.

The first camera captured an outline of every object at day time, however, the details are all missing. It technically cannot recognize a face from living room and dining room away.

Adding a whole new set of A/V cables from each of 4 cameras to a tri level house would have been a real struggle for me. Addionally, I wanted to be able to use it as a video - intercom at my front door to avoid having to open it prior to knowing who was there and what they wanted. Front door forced entries are starting to show up in this area and this would assist in not being a victim.  This item was just purchased about a week ago.I started by installing one camera to see how the system worked and what kind of signal strength it could produce. My first tests almost had me sending the whole system back for a refund BUT additional tests confirmed information that is VITAL for the user to know which is a total game changer.To start, DO NOT MOUNT THE CAMERA PEDESTAL BASE ON A CEILING. That puts the image upside down and there is NO adjustment to correct this.If you are near any large metal, such as flashings or a metal garage door, this will kill your wireless signal to the monitor. It took several tests to discover this. Once I moved the camera away from those things the signal improved substantially.On the monitor, the signal strength shows up as 1-4 bars. If you cannot get reliably at least 3 bars your in trouble. The camera will provide a drifting wireless signal which will show up periodically as \"No Signal\" if under 3 bars. If you establish at least 3 bars your fine.The video of the cameras is very acceptable for the overall cost of this system. Daytime is full color  and reasonably clear.Night time, the camera switches over to Infra Red. Your picture is black & white but is amazingly bright in full darkness. It looks like you left a light on.For two-way audio/intercom functions, the manual explains that your camera must be within six feet of the monitor. It also mentions that this is supposed to be in use on camera 1. What I did was use a little piece of blue painters tape and mark #1 on the tape and paste it on the primary camera which came in the same box as the monitor.  When you first start the system up, it's designed to use this first camera as the \"Camera 1\" operation to the monitor.Mine is in that range. The camera is just outside my front door and the monitor just inside on an adjacent wall. The other cameras do receive audio which is recorded with any video to the SD card for each of the other three cameras which may be in a record mode either manually or in automatic mode.  The manual has a couple of instructions which are incorrect. Not a problem but being aware of these before you setup your system will help you.There are two power bricks inside the basic system box. One for the camera and one for the monitor. READ THE BACK OF EACH COMPONENT CAREFULLY. The monitor wants a 5 volt power brick. The camera wants a 9 volt power brick. The manual says 9. for the monitor and that's wrong.The manual says you can mount the pedastel mount on a ceiling but as stated here that makes the picture upside down.  The joystick on the monitor seems quite delicate. I suggest being extremely gentle when using it so you don't abuse this little switch.  The manual says that when you want to view your recorded files put on the SD card, you need to have one camera showing you live on screen. When you are viewing a live camera shot, you simply push straight down on the joystick to bring up your recorded files. THAT IS CORRECT, HOWEVER if your camera signal strength is less then 3 bars your going to have a very difficult time viewing your files too. So once again, having three bars of signal strength is necessary.  Last item: If you are experiencing low signal no matter what you try there is NO BOOSTER accessory for the cameras. That is unfortunate because now that I got mine operating properly I can tell you I am quite pleased with the results.It would be a real plus for the SVAT company to offer a more powerful antenna or power booster for those who really needed one.  The Bottom Line: This is a simple solution to most basic surveillance needs if that is acceptable. It's priced quite fairly for what it produces. If you need a really sophiscated system, then keep shopping.For me this covers all four sides of my house with a minimal of wiring needs. Yes, you must supply electricity to each camera and they tell you clearly that these are weather resistant, not weather proof so if they must be out of a protected location like under a roof eve you will have to put them into some box to assist them from avoiding direct inclement weather. If you keep in mind that wireless devices need extra consideration so as to help them in gaining unobstructed signals and then keep them within a range of the monitor of less then 100 feet, you should have a properly working system.", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Warning", "Author": "RCinVT", "ReviewID": "R20731XHC1EO4Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The additional cameras were delivered before the expected date.

The camera works well and is easy to use.  The picture quality is good enough and the night vision works well.  The monitor is fairly simple and the buttons are clearly labeled.  However there is a major design flaw with the monitor unit.  The power cord plugs into the back of base of the stand for the monitor.  The way the plastic around the plug is shaped, it wants the cord of the plug to go downwards, but since it's at the bottom of the unit, that's not doable.  This results in a very unstable power connection.  I have found you can lose the connection by just nudging the monitor.  I have found that it takes quite the effort just to get the unit to turn on and stay on.

After hearing of breakins and robberies, I decided to install an alarm system and setup a security camera.My acquisition of this Defender wireless security system fit into my plans. It is wireless, so I don't have to run cable from the camera to the base station. The equipment is light weight, so it isn't a chore to physically install it, and the guaranteed lifetime live support was attractive.Installing the system was a snap. You put the camera where you want it, as long as you are somewhat close to an electrical outlet. I have a window over my garage that has a nice view of the front of my house. The camera has a wireless antenna to send video and audio data to the base station.The base station can - and should - be some distance away - up to 100 feet away. I located mine in a corner of my living room, where there would only be one wall between the camera and the receiver. I just plugged the base station in, set the system to record continuously and then, a while later, unplugged the system to see what was captured. The data is stored on an SD card that is supposed to be included in the package - my package was missing the SD card, so I had to supply my own card.I plugged my card into my computer and Windows recognized the video and opened Windows Media Player and ran the video. The image quality stinks. I wasn't expecting Hollywood, but I had trouble recognizing the footage of my wife walking out to the driveway, 25 feet away. It reminded me of the lousy images captured on convenience store hold ups on crime shows. All I could think of was this: if someone robbed my house and this camera captured all of it, what good would this crummy video footage do to identify the bad guys?The missing SD card was bad enough, but when I emailed Defender to find out what larger size card I could install in the base station, my email went unanswered. When I tried to use their Live Chat function on their website, during the listed available hours, it said it wasn't available. When I tried calling them, I was on hold for ten minutes, then got interrupted by an incoming call I had to take. When I called back, my call went straight to voicemail. So much for the lifetime live support.One other issue about storage: The 2gb card that was supposed to come with the unit would only hold a few hours of continuous recording. The default setting on the receiver is to stop recording when the card is full, rendering the system somewhat useless. I tried setting the unit to only record when motion was detected, but the unit failed to detect motion! Honest! I went outside, in full view of the camera and waved at the camera, then came back to check the captured video..... there wasn't any! To override the default settings, you need to plug a monitor into the base, and I don't own any monitors that have RCA-type jacks anymore. Defender's website doesn't show any accessories that would allow me to connect a computer monitor directly to the base station, either. Clearly, even if Defender had included the 2gb SD card in the box, which they didn't, it isn't nearly enough storage to do anyone any good.If the system were as simple to operate as the setup was, we'd have something good to talk about. But the overall quality of the product leaves a lot to be desired.", "Date": "September 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Poor functionality for our application", "Author": "twinwasp", "ReviewID": "RGOTT8EYSR1XC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Positives: The camera's set up easily,  with no problems - almost effortless plug and play.  However -  the user interface is convoluted and the system can only record one camera at a time.  It will not record in quad mode.  This means that as an overnight security system it is essentially a one camera system.  This fact is glossed over in the documentation but is in the fine print.  Also - with motion detection set,  each time it turns on in creates a new AVI file.  On a windy night you could end up with hundreds of AVI files to view.  The camera image is not great, the biggest problem seems to be resolving bright and dark areas during daylight.  I doubt you could ID a suspect with those images.

IP01/IP00 rated cameras, don't expect them to last if exposed to the elements!NO granular controls of anything really, such as motion sensitivity, light ranges, etc.NO push capabilities (sending texts/alerts to devices etc)Ultimately this was easy to install, and the SECOND NIGHT it picked up a prowler around our property. I figured we had losers prowling around here, and it was good enough to give to the cops to issue an APB for the guy. For that, it works. But it soon became apparent this system was too limiting for me for the cost. Without ANY capability to monitor from remote, or even in my bed, I felt naked. Without any capability to expand it to extra monitors, or access recordings from the internet I felt pretty blind! Then came issues with false motion detection with no way to adjust it other than some scotch tape over the sensor.. Then came the 'lower' resolution in some cases which made it HARD to identify someone/something. Although these cameras are nice, they simply aren't up to commercial standards - good homeowner stuff, that's it! The last straw was range.. 20 feet away through a couple of walls this thing totally failed to pick up a signal.. Given it's not WIFI and relies on an old 2.4Ghz cordless phone standard, it's NOT going to get range, and you WILL NOT be able to boost that signal!I uninstalled it all and returned it.I elected to go with a Trivision 336W HD camera. Offering high definition resolution, strong 6db antennas, and WiFi. Local+Remote access. Cameras are long range, and super resolution - license plates and faces at 45 feet! Ip66+ rated camera, which is full immersion in water, rock/sand/dirt proof. They are sealed, but to last.Then I added Blue Iris software on an older PC in the home to act as a server. Blue Iris allows 'extreme' customization of all aspects of a camera system. I can 'mask' areas where I don't care, and 'hotspot' areas to be extra diligent about.. I can tweak everything. Further, using this method I can access all cameras anywhere on the planet, from any device on the planet. I can CONTROL them from remote. Blue Iris allows me to 'push' notifications, such as a doorbell to my devices/phones/tablets if someone comes to the door. Remarkable!Monitors? Easy.. I purchased some CHEAP $40 Tablets from Amazon here, with some cheap mounting brackets. One on each floor provides a full control panel, monitoring, and emergency trigger for every floor of the home - all wireless!  A check 7 inch Tablet is the perfect solution in my view. Install Blue Iris Mobile on each tablet, slide them into the brackets in say your bedroom, and by your computer, and you have a full home monitoring system.The system I have in place is 1000x better. BUT it is NOT for people that cannot 'set' things up, or 'tweak'.. Be warned.. If you want a fire and forget 'reasonable' system - then THE DEFENDER is the best one on the market IMO.

Rahmlow", "ReviewID": "R3PMYBSW2LH2EA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Utterly disappointing with this product.  If we can buy a little black box for fifty buck that can wireless stream full tv series, you would think that for nearly five times the cost you could buy a camera that would reliably record a low quality video.... wrong.The first set I received was DOA.  It was a new item with the camera power line cut in half.  After returning it and ordering a second set everything appeared to be ok.  I did a dry run in the house and then I installed these cameras outside.  The first concern I had was with the ball joint.  It looks nice enough but you cannot lock the cameras in place.  The joint is just too flimsy, and no matter how tight you make it, a strong wind or bump with cause the cameras to point in another direction.  That said, they are staying fairly accurately aimed for the time being.  Another flaw I see is that the 6 foot power line for the camera is sealed in the actual unit.  If your running the cord through a wall like I am, the you will have to pull the cord back through the wall if you need to take the camera down to clean or repair it.After finally getting them wired up, I was saddened to find out the wireless antenna on one of the cameras doesn't work.  Only if its in direct line-of-sight with the receiver, will it pick up the signal.  Once I closed the window or stepped inside the house with the lcd, the signal was lost. Now, I have to hang the LCD display in the window to get a connection.  The other camera however worked fine and had no problems with signal.After installing the cameras, I set the receiver to motion recording.  In general it seemed fine.  The color is a little off on the recorded video, brown comes across slightly purple and in general there is a pink tint to the footage.  The night vision seems sufficient. The recorded \"video\" isn't really video.  It's more like a 20s movie file that displays about 6 still photos that were taken over a 5s window, together this makes a slow-motion picture movie that you end up clicking through just to see the different images that were taken.After a couple days of operation, one of the cameras has collected moisture inside so the entire image is fogged up and worthless.  The moisture will not go away so the only way to remove it is to dismantle the camera and dry it out, which as I mentioned earlier, will require pulling the power-line to the camera back through the wall.  Basically it's now just an expensive dummy camera.  After another week we've reached freezing conditions outside and the motion detection on both cameras is not working.  I'm not sure if its just the outside temperature that's causing the IR detector to not work or if it's an actual malfunction in the entire system.  Either way, the plethora of issues I've experienced with this system will keep me away from this brand as I shop for a legitimate replacement.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "VERY POOR PICTURE QUALITY", "Author": "J.

Even IF their product is good quality there is NO support phone number on their website except for the 3rd party call center number on their website. If you want tech support you have to fill out a form on their website and hopefully they will get back to you in a timely manner. When I called the customer support line for pre-sales questions the lady I spoke with put me on hold a couple minutes just to look up the model number of this product. Then when she finally found it I asked a simple question. \"Does your company have 24/7 phone support for your clients?\" She said I had to fill out a form to get tech support and there was no direct number and that all she was was a sales rep. I told her \"but the automated voice on the phone told me to dial 1 for sales and PRE-SALES questions.\" Yet she knew nothing about the product. Sounds to me this Defender company has hired a 3rd party call center, who probably takes care of hundreds of other call centers for other company's, and does not know anything about the product. Then when you want support its non existent. Maybe there is a support number somewhere hidden on their website or on the manual when you get the product but first impression I got was that this company is a hit and run company. They sell you a product and give you no support.Because of the poor support and little to no answer to my pre-sales questions I was turned off immediately to this company. I would suggest you do your homework before you buy from this company.UPDATE: 12/1/2013I purchased this from Wal-Mart Ship-to-store in case this product is a bust and wouldn't have to go through Amazon and do all the shipping hassle. As I feared this product is extremely limited and full of security risks. Let me explain...1. First if the DVR loses power for any reason it goes into auto channel mode instead of quad mode. This means if you have 2-4 cameras it would give a thief plenty of security holes to bypass your camera since this DVR will only record during an active connection to a SINGLE camera unless in quad mode. So in other words there is about a 15 second window security window.2. While in quad mode recorded schedules do not work.3. There is no remote control. Remote control meaning viewing recorded or live feed via the internet, app or even on your local lan. The only way to view it is either through a tv using the a/v cables or by physically taking out the SD and inserting it into your computer.4. The quality. Oh my gosh the quality is horrible. I had to have my wife's face 2 feet from the camera in order to know what I was looking at. This security system will by no means provide visible evidence to identify a burglar or anyone for that matter unless they stair right into the camera 2 feet away. Otherwise its all block and pixelated.5. This only records in 5, 15 and 30 second intervals when motion is detected. Why not record motion until it stops?6. The GUI is extremely basic that a 10 year old could of written the language. Probably made using Pascal. If you don't know the coding language pascal its a dead computer language no one uses anymore.The only good things I can think of that can come out of this was its ease to pair the cameras and DVR together and its simplicity to use it only because this system performs the most basic of functions. This is more of a toy for kids then an actual surveillance system.My recommendation is to stay away from this product. This might of been top of the line 20 years ago but we have what you call HD 1080p quality now a days.

YES, it does work & it is pretty cool, i love the quad mode... being able to see four cameras at the same time is great. Yes i ordered 2 more cameras, as 2 just did not cut it. I purchased a 17 in. Acer PC monitor to display the images because the thought of trying to watch 4 cams on a 7-9 in screen did not seem like a pleasant prospect. I am glad i went the extra mile because it worked out well....i can see clearly in every direction outside at a glance while watching tv & working on the computer.OK... the product is not perfect, not even close....the biggest problem is reception range is nowhere near what they advertise...but even so i was able to work out a good set up.One thing they dont tell you is that you cannot pair one camera to 2 different recievers, i tried this so i could watch from both down & upstairs ... to solve this quandry i split the VGA cable [converted from RCA] & ran one to the 1st floor monitor, worked out perfect....now i can see all four cams from monitors on both floors...reducing the odds of me missing something. Though not perfect...I find the motion detect/auto record to work pretty good....though some cams seem to work better than others. One reviewer stated the system would not record over 30 seconds...but mine has made recordings a full 60 seconds long!... motion is the key....if there is continuous motion it will keep recording.Though a bit on the cheap/cheesy side of things...it IS one of the next best things to a very expensive set up... and it is not rocket science...meaning If you are patient & take your time you can work out a good set up to suit your needs despite it's inherent limitations.No this is not the best set up in the world..but it makes my world better....as i said it is very nice being able to see what is going on outside at night....and the NV is not bad at all,  i get four legged visitors most every night....racoons, skunks, deer, ect.And the defender watches my back while i sleep....alerting me when it senses something...now that is pretty nice.And in the morning... any activity missed while sleeping is waiting for me to inspect....yes it is something of a pain to scroll through, but it is worth it. Image quality is acceptable... a bit choppy but otherwise pretty good.The system allows you to 2x zoom the camera image too... sweet. Also....i hooked up my Defender with a remote on/off so i can quickly & easily wake it up or put it to sleep....one reason i did this is because my monitors are being shared by another camera system  [thanks to a 2 port VGA switch] that i use in conjunction with the defender.Yes there are times when it can be a bit frustrating.. like, cam 4 just does not sync up as well as the others....& as far as that goes i do not think it is a camera issue....i think it is how the reciever is programmed....in that apparently it can only recieve one signal at a time....so it juggles all four....& whichever one is in it's \"hand\" is the one that gets the live image....the other three will display a stale images until their signal gets refreshed, & for some reason #4 gets left out of the active loop more so than 1,2 or 3........but all things considered i think the Defender is a pretty darn good system that can work for anyone willing to work with it.", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Additional cameras", "Author": "Gary Micko", "ReviewID": "R2WIOR2P0HHYIZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "They work very well.

It was extremely difficult to find a place that provided a signalIn seeking technical support, the website is utterly useless. The website has no troubleshooting suggestions or forums.

The video quality is sd and not as good a quality as you can now get from a lot of camera phones today.The wireless works pretty well but I only get a good/strong signal within about 50-60 feet of the recording unit. The recording unit/monitor is small enough it can be hid in a closet or cabinet but does need to be within reach of a power source.The cameras are simple to instal and set up. This was where having the video monitor was worth the extra money. Without it the installation process would have been lengthy and tedious. The motion detection has a few seconds lag before the system starts to record. So if someone is moving quickly they can \"get past\" the camera somewhat easily.  Also the cameras field of view is somewhat narrow.The monitor will hold a 32gb sd card and I have been able to store a month of recordings on it with room left on the card.Overall, the Defender/SVAT (same company) system is ok. It lets me monitor my property on the cheap. I hope the company has plans for an hd version of the system.

I wanted to use this as a baby monitor so installed in the kid's room about 40 linear feet away from the living room (and only 1 wall between).  Keep in mind it says 450 foot range on the box.  It worked great for few minutes, with excellent picture and audio quality for the 2-way audio, then jumped in and out of reception a few minutes later.  The signal bars would go from near full to zero about every 5 to 10 seconds, and the picture would flicker on and off.  I played with all of the settings (there aren't many settings to change), and moved the camera around the house to see if anything would help, and nothing did.  It simply wouldn't pick up and keep reception over just a few feet away.  I have no idea, maybe my wifi is interfering with the signal, maybe not.

It has most of the capabilities I need for my home at a very reasonable price. I ordered an additional camera to cover the rear of my house.After installation of A/C outlets to power the cameras, setup was a \"snap\". Each camera paired with the monitor as soon as power was applied to them. I was initially concerned about the 7\" monitor being too small but after the system was up and running, I was pleased that the monitor size is sufficient. The system was well thought out. Camera display is clear and detailed enough for identification of people, animals and vehicles. It provides operational modes to manually select a specific camera or automatically scan all cameras or display all cameras or display a screen saver while scanning all cameras in the background.My house was built during the time that walls were constructed with metal lathe and plaster (not wallboard). This, sometimes, interferes with RF signal reception -- so I have a problem with reception of one of the cameras when the monitor is in the Family Room unless I place the monitor in the ideal reception area. I knew this was a potential problem but I have been able find locations where reception is acceptable in all areas of the house.It would have been ideal if the manufacturer had a repeater or signal multiplier for this purpose -- but they don't.This is great system, especially at its price.I recommend this system to all that don't have houses with metal lathe and plaster wall construction.", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Defender PX301-010 Digital Wireless DVR Security System with 7 Inch LCD", "Author": "Rev.

Morse \"So Cal girl 333\"", "ReviewID": "R27LNF8QPH1A6O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was very easy to set up and use. For the price you get the SD card recording DVR, which was a great feature for us. We mounted it on a rotor on a pole, so we can have the camera rotate almost a full 360 degrees from inside the house. I really like that you have one-button instant recording while watching a live feed from the small remote that comes with it. Or set it to motion detecting and it can record for 5, 15 or 30 seconds. Or program it for a scheduled recording while you are gone. With the motion detect recording, if it keeps detecting motion it will continue to record, which I like. We purchased a 48 LED CCTV IR infrared Night Vision Illuminator light to help enhance the nightvision of this camera. Even without the extra IR light, the nightvision built in with this camera goes about fifty feet depending on the angle the camera is set at. With the extra IR light, we get about another twenty feet and everything is lighter and clearer. For the nightvision built in the camera, you WILL see the red LED IR lights when they are on at night. They are actually quite bright and we could see them from over fifty feet away, from any angle. For a simple camera with a DVR and nightvision, it's a very good deal. The daytime color does have a slight washed-out look (no natural greens) but that isn't a problem or big deal. The image is slightly shaky, even for wireless, but again for the price you get a fairly good camera. For a better camera and better videos you would have to pay more. The only thing about this camera I don't like is the microphone for sound. It doesn't pick up sound very well at all unless you are right next to the camera, or the sound is loud. Motion detecting can vary depending on angle and the light outside. We have had it pick up motion up to fifty feet away, but had to angle it just right to get it to do that, and the light has to be just right during the day. It seems to pick up motion better early in the morning and around dusk, so natural light has a lot to do with how well it will pick up motion and record when on motion detector recording. For the price and what you get with it, it's a great deal and we already want to purchase an add-on additional camera for the tiny bit of area we can't cover. We did get a ;16gb SD card, so if we are gone for a lengthy time it will record a lot.

They only wanted me to send the unit into them so they could evaluate it and then would let me know what they would do...)Second system was much better. No static and clearer more colorful picture. Would like a bit wider angle lens for driveway camera and better range on the motion detector portion. I had though in auto switching mode that it would stop  on the camera that movement was detected. But does not seem to. The camera attachment articulating joint locking mechanism could use some improvement. Hard to tighten to the point that it does not move. Afraid to crank on it and break it. Hopefully I will not have to mess around with it and that it will stay where I positioned it. So far pretty happy with the purchase now that I have a properly working system. So would probably buy again and would recommend it to a friend.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "No 24/7 tech support.", "Author": "Larry C.

When we just had camera 1 i could bring the monitor up to our bedroom at night, but with camera 2 i can't - the signal doesn't reach. anyways they were super easy to set up. they have decent picture quality... well maybe not in the dark so much, my husband locks the chickens in at night and i could barely recognize him at first.. we fiddled with the brightness and eventually got it to the point where if he were a robber the police would know they were looking for a white man who had dark hair and was balding a little, that he had on shirt and pants lol, not much besides that though, maybe could have drawn out face shape but not many features. also the color is weird, i was watching the video and was laughing that my husband was wearing a purple shirt until he came inside and it turned out he was wearing a white shirt? weird- oh well maybe i have to fiddle with settings more.  anyways I am in a fairly rural area and the cameras were more for my reassurance than for police reports- so no biggie. Basically something was eating our chickens and I wanted to find out what... neighbors dog>:(  and occasionally our car alarm has gone off in the middle of the night and the motion light is on and we wanted to see if it was a person or of it was an animal bumping into the car or if the car was just looney. haven't figured that one out yet- but next time the alarm goes off we will.  All in all i feel confident even with the color and signal issues that if someone were to come down our driveway and cause trouble we would 1. know for sure it was an intruder and not the wind or a wild animal. and 2. if the house was actually robbed i feel that the police could get a decent idea of who did it- we have a tiny town too so they probably already know most of the usual suspects. Overall i like having the cameras- but i probably wont buy two more like I originally intended.

I knew as soon as I opened the box that there was a very good chance it was going back.Everything feels cheap. The monitor looks and feels like something you would buy as a toy for children. The software on the monitor is like interacting with something from 10 years ago. The cameras look like they would be weather resistant only if they were completely under an eave and out of any weather whatsoever. The mounts for the camera are CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP! The thumb screw mounts wont tighten enough to hold the ball joint steady. If they were hanging they might be ok, ie. with the camera below the ball joint as in an under eave mounting. That way, no stress would be on the ball joint. Otherwise, the weight of the camera will make the ball joint loosen and the camera will droop down. Lastly, the volume for the alarm would not mute or turn down. I would turn the volume to the lowest setting and it would default back to the original volume every time.There are some good points though. I found the video to be decent. A lot of reviews are complaining about the video quality but, it's 640X480, what did you expect?

So I would say that I'm not an electronics/network/PC beginner nor am I a highly-skilled Pro.I purchased the Defender PX301-010 security system to watch over my driveway and cars during the night time hours. This system was extremely easy to set up - just plug in the camera and LCD monitor/DVR to suitable power outlets, turn the LCD/DVR on and it's ready to go. The included PSS software - which I intended to use to record and review video clips - was challenging to get going to say the least. I eventually gave up and just monitored the camera through the web interface. Video quality was good during daylight hours and even better at night. Motion sensor worked well and the camera only lost the signal during one time while I was testing it - and that was when the camera and LCD DVR were at completely opposite ends of my house. The camera itself seemed solid and well-built while the LCD monitor/recorder was just average in terms of build quality.With all that said I did end up returning the product due to it's video quality - it just wasn't sharp or detailed enough for my needs. To be fair the camera is only 640x480 (which I knew prior to purchase) and it performed very well for it's price in my opinion. It was more than easy to get it running (if you don't use the PSS software) and should be seriously considered if the buyer has little or no experience with configuring a home network and/or FTP servers. I replaced the system with a Q-See QCN7001B  720p camera that - by itself - costs as much as this whole system. In addition to the 720P camera I also purchased (and recommend) Blue Iris Professional monitoring software.Even though I decided to return this system in the end, I would definitely recommend the Defender PX301-010 system to others on a tight budget.", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Defender Digital Wireless DVR Security System with 7 Inch LCD Monitor, SD...", "Author": "H.Roberts", "ReviewID": "R3SH2RNKV9PRAX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am not impressed  by this system at all, they advertize it been wireless but yet you'll have to find a place to plug the leads coming from the camera's,so this is not a wireless system i'm so upset with myself for purchasing this garbage,if you are looking for a system to watch your baby it will be the ideal kit,but it was a bad start for me anyway i order the black set and they sent me silver never again.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "For the price, it does the job.", "Author": "John D.

Meissner", "ReviewID": "R1P6HBULX41XKA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased two of these systems. My intent is to have four wireless cameras and one receiver, attached to a 17\" flat screen LCD TV monitor. Installation of the receiver and setup was pretty easy. I paired all the cameras in the house first, then went about installing cameras outdoors. Note that the cameras are \"weather-resistant\", not weatherproof, and the product literature does state this. For my application I was able to install cameras under the eaves of home and garage, so they will be afforded some protection from weather.The range of the cameras is spec'd at \"up to 450 feet\", but clearly this is line of sight with no obstructions. I located the receiver and monitor in our kitchen area. Camera 1 and 2 are mounted outside under the eaves of the house, maybe 40' point to point distance from the receiver. The signal passed through metal siding and walls, glass doors... and video reception is pretty good. Camera 3 is mounted under the eaves of the garage, maybe 80' away. Reception drops out frequently. The garage and eaves are all metal siding, so maybe this is a factor. Video does get to the receiver, but if you monitor signal strength it will be three bars, then drop to one, then it regains and displays OK. On occasion video drops completely and NO SIGNAL is displayed for several minutes. I think this could be resolved if the antennas on both camera and receiver were a little better, or perhaps provide a flexible length of coaxial cable so the antennas can be oriented in a different location. I did find that if I hold up the receiver to about 6' in the dining area near the wall that reception improves and is steady.... but this is reminscient of fiddling with the rabbit ears on a 1960's TV (some of you will remember that) to get a decent picture.My solution may be to build a little shelf and put the receiver there. That may actually work fine.Video itself is pretty decent. Perhaps not high enough resolution to read a license plate on a car in the driveway, but good enough to see what kind of car and color. Viewing video in quad mode (all four cams at once) is a cool feature, but recording is disabled in quad mode and video quality seems slightly reduced.The hardest part of installing the cameras is getting power to them. I have had to tap off external light circuits and run power closer to the camera installation, but that was not too hard to do.Camera 4 is not yet installed, but now that I know 80' through a lot of walls is about the range limit I will be more careful where I install it (and check the location first by using an extension cord, THEN do the install.)Also, I did note that video quality is pretty good and does not seem to interfere at all with wireless internet. That's a big plus.Overall I would consider the system good value for the cost.We own an older SVAT wireless system that my wife uses to check her animals in the barn. It still works but is susceptible to wireless phone and wireless internet interference.

If you're not a technical person, do not worry as you'll have no problems.DVR: The dvr recorder \"box\" is quite small and easy to hide.  It's about the size of a man's wallet.  It also provides an additional sensor receptor for the remove control.  The cord for the additional sensor receptor is about four feet long.  The additional sensor receptor has a sticky side. So you can place the dvr totally behind the TV/Monitor, yet run the additional sensor to the front of your tv and stick it on the front.  Now point your remote control at the sensor.DVR menu system: Easy to navigate.Camera picture quality: Good enough.  Daytime quality is good. Nighttime infrared is good.Camera motion activated recording:  Definitely below par.  If the subject (motion) is not directly in front of the camera line, the motion is not detected.  Plus it will not record the first two seconds after motion.  So if someone walks past the camera, you're lucky to get a record of the person at all.Reception distance:  Not good.  I couldn't install the dvr in my bedroom because it would not receive two of the cameras.  I had to put the dvr in a room close to the three cameras.  ie, the reception does not go thru wall well.

I was expecting a need to hard-wire a junction box in the awning of my house to get me power, but the power cord is so stinking long, I just drilled a hole into my house and stuck it through, caulking around it.

It feels and pops like bubble wrap pops, with each button press.Picture quality:  Is obviously best during the day, and at night I have two 150 watt bulbs on a motion sensor nearby.

The reason that I took off 3 stars is because the quality of the video is horrid to put it best.

The video is comparable to those rather grainy surveillance cameras you may have seen on your hi-def unit at home when they show 7-11 robberies etc. That said, I wasn't really expecting 1080P out of this unit, it is what it is. It lets you see what is going on around the outside of your house. It helps to adjust the settings to high quality but it is still rather poor. The unit is relatively easy to set up which is a major plus as it includes the needed hardware to mount your camera and detailed instructions on setting up your receiver and how to operate the features of both receiver and camera. There is 24/7 lifetime customer support although I haven't had a need to use them yet. I have tried it in two different locations to see the difference and there was a minor difference in the area that received more night time light. It comes with a 2GB SD card so you may want to put a larger one in for convenience,otherwise you can delete as the card holds 340 minutes. If you need additional cameras the Defender allows up to four cameras if you need more areas under the watchful, motion detector eye of the Defender.I am new to having a security system at home, so the hookup for a novice is fine I believe. If you have a business, this may not be the unit for you, as you may want a little more of an elaborate system, although this one works just fine.

Easy.Plug in the camera, plug in the base station, and you're ready to go.I've used it for a couple of weeks now, most recently to fend-off the neighborhood kids during homecoming!  My favorite feature is the motion detecting record function.  When a car drives by, or when a kid runs past, it records and the base unit beeps to alert.  In this capacity, it works flawlessly.  My only real gripe is with the night time video quality.  It's grainy, and can be a bit choppy.  But for what it is, and for what it costs, it's a great buy.

Well made, quality materials, packaging and instructions/support, for a relatively low price.Ease of setup.  Incredibly easy.  I wanted to see how fast I could get an image on my TV after unpacking this, and it was FAST people.  I'm thinking 5 minutes or so.  Just plugged in the camera to power.  Plugged in the receiver to power and the TV, and it just worked!  Didn't even have to pair the units up, they auto detected.  Anytime you deal with wireless networking, there is potential to be a REAL time sink, or some problems, esp. if you have other routers, etc., but I didn't even have to touch anything except the power cord to plug things in.Decent image quality.  Especially impressed with the infrared capability, as it was MUCH clearer than I was expecting.  I tested in a variety of lighting conditions, facing spotlights and floodlights, facing my dark doorway entry, even facing out away from my house (to test range).  Impressive all around, especially after I turned brightness down.CONS:No networking capability.  You won't be able to access your live feed, or recordings from a mobile device or computer away from your base location.  Higher end models have this feature, but they also cost more accordingly.Still expensive, just not relative to other video surveillance systems.  If you are just interested in just a deterrent, you can get a mock camera for about $35 or so.I would probably get one model up just to get that cool \"check on your house from anywhere with a browser!\" capability, but OTOH, I am not that paranoid.My use of this will most likely be:1.  Monitoring front door.  I am often away on business trips, and I would like my wife to be able to be able to see who is at the door when/if doorbell rings.2.  Deterrent to potential burglars.  This thing LOOKS serious.  At night, the infrared LED's have a low, red glow that literally looks like the Eye of Sauron.  Awesome!3.  Possibly might get another camera to hook up and use as baby monitor.  Since I already have the receiver unit, it would be cheaper to buy one more camera only, rather than a whole video monitor system for babies.  Since this unit records sound as well, should work fine (EDIT: Bad idea since you have to have a TV on for this to work...I just ordered a separate baby video monitor since using this unit that way is not practical imo (no portability at all which kills the idea)Highly recommended.

All you need to do play the SD on your computer and it's all good. And lastly, 2. When you set it to record on \"motion,\" it doesn't pick it up until the object in motion are about 15 ft from the camera. Even with adjusting the angle, we still had this problem, so with a 32G SD card, I set it to record 24hrs a day to eliminate this problem.

I am not new to video surveillance have had it for almost 20 years for my businesses and home.  Thus not a novice to setting up far more difficult systems than this one... and was looking forward to a first time experience of an \"easy-setup\" --- also liked the fact that it recorded to a SD Card - and not having to fight with the picture on a recorder or DVR system.Well... it was easy to set up as they said... the problem ... is getting it to WORK/FUNCTION as advertised!!  Initially I set it up in my bedroom looking out a large window one camera at each end.  As we had our cameras destroyed that were outside by a trespasser... so this time we were going to try keeping them inside where they could not be bashed in.They were only 2-3 ft from the receiver - it took the cameras a long time to pair themselves with the receiver even pairing them manually.  Finally... they started working...  BUT ... frequently one or the other would drop the signal with the receiver... one time right in the middle of someone coming onto the property whom I wanted recorded! -- This went on for 2 days... I would have to go through the manual re-pairing process as described in their manual to get the cameras to transmit and connect with the receiver again... and each time it would not last very long!!!Finally... this morning... I decided to move them to another room... it states that they should be within 100 ft of the receiver for best communication between the cameras and the receiver... now they were about 10 ft from the receiver... I had one in the living room and one just outside the door -- as I found that the night vision is also Non-Existent if you have the camera looking out a glass window.This time...  the cameras ... would not communicate with the receiver... I went through all the steps in the manual as I did the first time when I did get them to work part of the time!!!  But - NOTHING - --- unplugged... let it rest... kissed it's little bottom... still... NOTHING!Finally, decided to try to call DEFENDER who is really a company called... CWD ... well they are liars and totally misrepresent the type of customer service you really get from them which is essentially ... NONE!I do not know about the rest of you but my time is precious and worth money just like theirs is ... they are getting paid to do their jobs... we are NOT getting paid for the horrendous amount of time ... where we are FORCED to spend HOURS ... in trying to get some customer service and technical support and instead just getting the good old run-around... which is exactly what I got from this company!!I tried calling first... all tape recorded - no possible way to get to speak to a live human-being.  I even tried calling the order line as I have learned that allot of companies will not answer their customer service lines and let you hold till you turn purple... because they already have your Money! Ha Ha Ha... they laugh all the way to the Bank~!But ... they will usually answer their new sales lines quickly... Well Not this Company... I hung on hold there too until I did turn purple and passed out!!!I then decided to go to their website... it is just as worthless as their phone service!!!  They tell you to send them an e-mail and IF you are real Lucky you May Hear from them in 2 to 3 Business Days!!!How do you like that!!!  I have been messing with this piece of worthless time-consuming junk that I purchased because I needed the use of it for 3 days!  Now I try to get some customer service/help while they set on my money... and I get told Maybe in 2 or 3 days someone might contact me via e-mail!!!  Now as you can tell I am just a little upset!!!They say they offer CHAT to their Customers finally after looking all over their site I find CHAT in itty-bitty print upper right corner - click it - go through the entire filling out of forms for the now 3rd time... and WAIT and WAIT some more ... it stated please wait you are Next In Line... yeah to hop on their slow boat to China!!Finally the Chat Screen disappears... so I have go out and go in again and re-enter everything all over again and again... WAIT - WAIT - WWWWAAAIITTT!!!This time around... I decide this is it... I have absolutely had it... I will take advantage of the ... THANK-GOD for Amazon Guarantee!!!And send this piece of JUNK back to them the crumbs at Defender/CWD!!!  Which I did and am!Now... It maybe some of these 5 stars are for real... and I got one of the LEMONS...BUT... when the alleged customer service is also a ...

Overall the system is easy to setup and should provide ample security for a single entrance home.", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "I Didn't", "Author": "Venus", "ReviewID": "REHD14YF1VKQ0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is used and I didn't purchase this used.
