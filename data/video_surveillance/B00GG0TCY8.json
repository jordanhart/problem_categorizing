I did have some issues with the mobile viewing, but after talking with Zmodo support, we were able to get it working. The MEye app and the ESee app work with this system best. Zmodo support was very helpful and is great to see them stand behind their product.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not recommend.", "Author": "Monte Weiss", "ReviewID": "R1OWDJ2CY29X7K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Software all in Japanese, not in English.  Can not read. Software is very unorthodoxies. Cannot fast forward or rewind sections. Unless they have updated software, your stuck watching everything from beginning to end.  Customer service is horrible. Called twice and was told they would call back right away but never did. Was told not to download the given software but rather wait till they called back with the right software. One of the cameras had something wrong with it upon install. Has major flickering going on. They say there outdoor cameras but would stand  a chance in the MN weather.", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GG0TCY8"}}
