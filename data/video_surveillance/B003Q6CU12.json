First, I absolutely recommend this monitor.  I've listed some specific strengths and weaknesses below.What I liked:1.  Good range.  In my two story house I got decent coverage throughout.  The signal was a little weak when I stretched it to its furthest possible range, but I never lost the picture.2.  On the small screen the picture is crisp, with good color.  You will never have to wonder what you're seeing.  Look carefully at the image on the video I took of the outdoors and you'll see a crisp blue autumn sky with colorful foliage.3.  I think the portability is a key feature.  The monitor can be removed from its base and slipped into a pocket as you move around your house.  Very nice!4.  You can add cameras, all of which show up on the monitor.  You can then select which camera you want to \"zoom\" to on the screen.  Hopefully you won't be monitoring four babies at once, but the capability is there.What I would like to see improved:1.  Customer service!  I always try to test this during a review, since it tends to be the \"Achilles Heel\" of modern commerce.  I first let the  customer service rep (Asian, but very understandable) know I was writing a review and had a specific problem I needed solved (see below).  It became clear immediately that the rep was not familiar with the product.  After about 20 minutes he admitted he could not solve my problem, but he promised I would receive a return call or email within a couple of hours.  After ten days I have heard nothing.  Unacceptable!2.  The monitor is promoted as a camera which can take snapshots of your baby, and the advertisements feature beautifully lit photos of babies.  This is bogus.  The camera has a whopping .3 megapixels.  This is perfectly fine for the small monitor screen, but trying to use it as a camera to photograph your baby will result in a blurry, pixelated photo if you try to even print it 4x6.  It puzzles me that Lorex even included a microSD card and adapter for you to transfer your pictures to a computer.  You wouldn't really try to photograph your beautiful baby with a .3 MP camera, would you?  Which brings me to another point . . .3.  The reason I called customer service was the image from the camera when I took a snapshot was not only rotated (easily fixed) but reversed.  For instance, any printing would look backwards.  I'm not sure if this is peculiar to the sample I received, but it's annoying to be sure.  Yes you can fix this in a photo editor, but you shouldn't have to.  I have no idea what's going on, and neither did customer service.  The image is fine on the monitor screen, and the problem only shows up when you transfer a picture, which you are unlikely to do anyway given the poor resolution.So let's sum up:  I really like the Lorex Baby Monitor and I would definitely buy it.  I take off one star for the failure of customer service to respond to my problem and the misleading pictures which imply the monitor can be used to take good quality pictures.  If you purchase it with the idea that you are only monitoring your baby (pets, etc) and not capturing lifetime memories, you'll be very happy.", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "No Perfect Baby Monitor", "Author": "C. Duncan", "ReviewID": "R25YGBM8EJWSPB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We have owned this monitor for about 48 hours now and wanted to provide our first impressions quickly.First, we have previously owned a Summer Infant video baby monitor with our first child two years ago.  We were not happy with it.  The sound wasn't great and the video eventually went out on it after about a year of use.  With our second kid we decided to get another video baby monitor and looked for one that supported more than one camera.  Let's just say that there isn't a high quality video baby monitor out there that I have found.  I'll start with the pros.Pros:- Video quality is as good as its peers.  It won't wow you, but it serves its purpose.  At night it has pretty good range and is more than adequate.- Little interference.  We have cell phones, wi-fi, cordless phones, an audio baby monitor and many other wireless devices and we have not had any interference.- Range.  Pretty good.  We had the camera at the front of the house and were able to get a signal at the back.  It was probably 35 feet away and had 4 - 5 walls in between.- Usability.  The buttons are laid out well and intuitive.  We like the form factor - kind of like an old school candy-bar-style cell phone.- Two-way communication.  It works when you can get the 'up' button to work (see cons).Cons:- Build quality is subpar.  The plastic is kind of cheap.  The buttons are not responsive.  The menu button and the up/talk button take multiple attempts to activate.  It is as if the plastic buttons do not align properly.  It can take 4-5 attempts to activate the menu at times.  Very annoying.  When scrolling through the menu the down button works perfectly but the up button works erratically.  Often I just end up scrolling through the entire list using the down button.  The other buttons, 1-4, left/right, power don't seem to have a problem so it may just be this particular unit.  It makes me wonder if we will get a full year of use out of the monitor before it goes belly up, though.- VOX does not work.  The monitor has a setting called VOX that only turns the monitor on after it detects a noise.  It doesn't work on ours.  We have power save off as the instructions indicate.  We have put it in an empty room (i.e. quiet) and turned on the VOX to its lowest sensitivity (highest noise required to activate) and it just cycles on almost immediately after turning off.  It just cycles on/off continuously.  When setting it to its highest sensitivity we see no difference.  We have turned VOX off and just use the power save feature (video turns off after a preset amount of time).- Audio.  It is ok.  Without VOX there is a constant light hum since the audio is always on.  It doesn't get super loud either (not a big deal for us).  No interference in the audio is a plus, though.  The speaker is placed on the back of the unit.  When you don't have the receiver in the cradle, the speaker can be muffled when you set it down.  It will not stand up on end, so you either set the monitor down on the speaker or on the lcd screen.- Cradle.  The cradle is a little annoying.  The cradle has a male end of a mini-usb that the unit plugs into to charge.  The slot the unit slides into on the cradle isn't really tight so it takes a little finesse to get the mini-usb to line up on the unit.  Not a big deal but isn't as easy as we would like when checking out the monitor late at night.The monitor is ok.  Not great.  I wish there was a high quality video monitor out there.  I would definitely pay up for one instead of going through a new one every year.", "Date": "September 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Recommended; not sure about tech support though (better in late 2011 it seems!)", "Author": "Dennis", "ReviewID": "R37GSQRZURGIH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far I like this baby video monitor.- The video quality is great- Night vision works well- It works even with my WiFi 802.11g, 2.4 GHz cordless phone, 2.4 GHz wireless speakers and a microwave oven.- Battery life is good.  I've had the receiver on for 5 hours and the battery indicator is down to 33%.  This is with VOX and Power Save both off.- I dropped this 2x on our (hard) floor and it still works (phew).- I expecially like the 2-way communication.  I don't use it a lot to talk to our baby.  I found it to be useful when my wife is with our baby and needs to tell me something.  Not only can I hear her through the handheld monitor but I could reply!  It's like having a video walkie-talkie.- Uses a micro-USB (I think) connector for power.  This is the same connector used by some electronics (like my old Garmin nuvi 350, my Logitech Harmony 550 remote, etc).  If you want an extra charger in another room you could likely use one you already have that came with another product.- The camera has a rechargeable internal battery.  I find this convenient when I want to temporarily move the camera (i.e., to keep an eye on our baby when in her swing) without fussing about power cords.  I don't know how long the battery lasts as I only use it like this for a few tens of minutes.Wish list:- Support multiple handheld receivers (so more than one parent can monitor the baby).  I have not seen any digital video baby monitors support this.- It would be nice if the camera can be mounted on a tripod to make it more portable (i.e., bring it to my home office when bring the baby's bassinet there, etc).- I wish the handheld had a flip-out stand so I can prop it up while away from the charging base.  This would be nice to have but not that critical for me.What I don't like:- The plastic looks and feels cheap- The silver logo (not red and black as shown in product pictures) looks even cheaper -- sort of like it was just spray painted on it (like an engineering project or a cheap Chinese knockoff... heck those even look better sometimes).  I know this is less important than the technical features but still, appearance does matter.  The monitor gives off a cheap vibe in my opinion.- Volume on the handheld monitor is kinda low- A crib mounting bracket would be nice to have.  I considered mounting the camera on the wall but it was too far from our baby (and she does not typically face the wall!).  Instead, I strapped it onto the crib myself but will have to move it once the child gets older and can reach it.What I hate:- Sales and customer service is a joke!  I have never seen live sales chat active and I've been checking for a month or longer.  I sent an e-mail to customer support and nobody replied.  I also left a voice mail for sales support and again no reply.  [update 11/22/2011: Now tech support seems to be more responsive.  I inquired about a replacement charging dock and received a prompt reply]Recommended?Sure!  I still recommend the product but all bets are off if you need technical support.", "Date": "September 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "back to the drawing board", "Author": "Frugal in Hawaii", "ReviewID": "R7ZCPU44Z7YKR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I felt that I had done the research and that I made a good choice. I should have known that with all wireless technologies there are weaknesses. This unit operates on the 2.4-2.6 Ghz band the same as all the wireless routers and phones in my neighborhood. Lorex also stated that going through walls would be different for each application, This was the case for me, I am in the next room and only have drywall and doors but the signal was weak. It was so bad that I would only have intermittent reception at best. The video was clear when it did work but the audio was choppy.My old fisher price monitor was clearer. When I called Lorex, all they had to offer was to move the camera around which made no difference. Since this is a safety monitoring device I had to opt to return it and to do more research on video monitors. I also noticed people mentioned in other reviews about the speaker being on the back. This is a problem when you set it down because you can only face it that way when out of the charging craddle.", "Date": "November 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "I wish that it had worked out", "Author": "J. Paskett", "ReviewID": "R2NCETMZLLUD0P", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After our second daughter was born September 14th, 2010 we decided to purchase a video monitor. After several hours of reading reviews and researching online I decided to go with the Lorex LW2003. The primary factor in deciding to go with the LW2003 were the good reviews of its predecessor, and the many features the product description touted, primarily the distance it advertised from the base unit. Upon un-boxing it I felt as though I had made the correct choice. It appeared to be well built and the design just seemed better than our neighbors several year older Summer \"night and day.\" The screen size was certainly much larger at 2.4 inches and the display unit was more like a cell phone than the larger unit of the Summer night and day. Upon turning it on I discovered that the underside of the glass covering the screen either had a piece of something in it or the screen had dead pixels. It was difficult to tell which, but I think it was probably something under the glass. I could have lived with the display issue and had planned on it. However what I could not deal with was that the advertised 450 ft of distance capped out at closer to 15 feet out our back door, approximately 30  feet from the unit. I realize that the 450 ft is labeled as (clear-line-of-sight) notwithstanding this my neighbor's much older, and much less expensive Summer \"night and day\" unit gets reception from several hundred feet away, across the street, through two houses and into our kitchen. Juxtaposing the performance of that unit with my newer Lorex2003 is very discouraging, particularly because the Lorex advertises a greater distance, and yet just a few feet beyond our back porch the monitor display reads, \"searching for base unit.\"  I can only assume that the wireless technology utilized for its \"interference free digital signal\" does not transmit nearly as strong of a signal.If distance outside your house is not important this may be an ok unit for you. For my family with a new born and an active 3 year old who likes to play in the back yard it is not sufficient. For us it is nice to be able to step out of the house and have our monitor with us in case the baby wakes up while we are watching our older daughter play. This unit does not allow us to do that, while others, namely the Summer unit discussed above clearly does.So I boxed it up today and I will be dropping it off at a UPS drop off tomorrow. I am thankful for Amazons return policy, but I won't be purchasing another Lorex. It looked like a good design, but when it comes to electronics function is always more important than form in my book.  I will probably go with a Summer unit, or maybe the phillips unit.", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Cannot live without this monitor-everything we need all in one!", "Author": "stayathomemami \"mami\"", "ReviewID": "R28CSLKPXG773N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "LOVE this monitor.

Unfortunately when we were buying our first one this monitor was way too expensive.  However, we just got a great deal on Cyber Monday purchasing this monitor for less than our old one (without the extra camera).That being said, I LOVE this monitor.  Our previous monitor was a Lorex as well but this has improved many of it's flaws.What I love:  1. The VOX function, many monitors didn't have this function and I love that I don't have to hear constant static in the background.  We have a sound machine running and it only comes on when my child is actually talking or crying.  I also love that you can adjust the sensitivity, I have a feeling we will be making it more sensitive when there is a newborn sleeping in the nursery.  2. Clear picture even in night mode my sleeping child is easy to see.  Big improvement from older model.  3. Two-way communication.  I kind of made fun of this one, but I have to say when I am moving my just turned two-year-old into a big bed in a month, I can see this being a great feature if he wonders out of bed.  4. Split-screen to view both cameras at the same time.  5. No bright LED lights on the hand held.  This was a big issue with the older model as well.  6. Light weight hand held.  7. Easy set up.  8. Knowing it is secure.  9. Absolutely no feedback from cell phones or other wireless devices!What isn't so great:  1. It is hard to get the hand held just right into the cradle.  2. There is no way to set the hand held upright without cradle. However, I didn't love my last monitor's option either, I always felt like I was going to break it off and it wouldn't lay flat.  I think I would rather have this monitor that lays flat than one that can't stand unless you plug it in.  3. I think the camera function is kind of pointless.  I don't really know why you would want it but the camera isn't good enough for something like this anyway.Why we stuck with a Lorex: We loved the VOX feature. Secure monitors.

This one seems like the design was all in the right direction, but execution just did not follow through. We'll be returning this system two and probably moving to a different Summer system or a regular security camera system.Pros:Compact Size-Cameras can run on batteries (but why if you are mounting them in a room?)-2 way speaker is cool (I like telling my son, \"Lay back down!\" LOL)-Many cameras on one monitor-VOX seems like a nice option-Price was great compared to other systems (sometimes you get what you pay for though!)Cons:-Gives terrible feedback - a very annoying cricket-like noise despite which camera you are using and where you put system; we have moved them to every possible place, turned off every electronic gadget that could provide interference, and still the crickets persist. You just can not sleep with this thing on (see other reviews also)-Monitor doesn't hold charge very long-There is no visual volume (lights that indicate noise, so you can have it on mute and see if there is noise coming from the monitor)-No way to upgrade system (via computer) for bugs, software upgrades-Monitor froze within first 5 minutes (showing a stale view on the screen) and the only way to restart the thing was to take the battery out and start again.-VOX seems nice unless you have a child who snores, talks in his sleep, turns over, cries out, coughs, etc. Then the monitor screen will be turning on and off all night in your face.-The volume at it's highest level is so low you can not hear much of what is going on. My son got out of bed 3 times last night and we didn't hear a thing until he was at his open door yelling for us (previous monitor we could actually hear him moving covers to get out of bed!)-The monitor (if not in charging base) does not stand up on any type of easel. So if you have it on the table in front of you, you will not be able to see the screen because it has to lie on it's back (or end but it's too narrow to stay upright and falls over constantly)-There is a great deal of choppiness and slight time delay in movement from the real thing to the monitor.-Cameras do not swivel from side to side much so if we mounted it in desired location, the view would be sideways. Had to alter where camera went because monitor would just not turn in right direction to get proper view.-Cords on cameras are VERY short so you don't have too much choice in where to mount it if you want to keep it plugged in (barely reached to ceiling height)", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good product", "Author": "4 stars", "ReviewID": "R39QO3MLCQLK2K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got the two monitor version of this as I am expecting a second child soon. My first child is 11 and autistic. He just recently had surgery on both legs and we needed to be able to see and hear him as well as talk to him. This product is great. The VOX setting ranges from sensitive to only registering loader yells. It worked well when he came back from the hospital because we had it set so low that we could ear him if he turned over in his sleep. Since he has a tendency to sleep walk, which would be disastrous for his feet, this was very helpful. We were able to catch him twice right before he got out of bed. Now we have a guard rail up so we have the setting set higher so it doesn't turn on every time he moves. We have the second camera hooked up and it scans well between the two rooms, but we haven't yet used it to monitor two kids so I will need to update this when the second arrives. I am wondering how the VOX will work with two monitors if you need different sensitivity levels.Pros: good range so far as we have one room in the basement and other monitors have had issues. Haven't had any interference or rnage problems. Haven't yet tried it to see if it works outside since it is still winter. VOX. I love this function. My son has a fan that goes all night and wears a CPap machine and this twill works great on the second of five sensitivity levels. The color and night picture are really good quality and everything I would expect for a night vision camera. Some people have left reviews saying that they couldnt hear when the receiver was out of the charger because you have to sit it with the speaker on the table. My version has a little ridge that allows the sound to be heard even if it is on the table. I see no difference in the sound laying onn the table versus in the charger.  Set up with the two cameras was easy as they were already linked together before we got them. You just  have to charge them for eight hours and then they are ready to go.Cons:  the volume control isn't the greatest and it can be hard to hear exactly what my son is saying. Even when my husband speaks it is sometimes hard to hear. We had it originally about 7 feet from the bed and we couldn't hear him talk. We could only hear that he was eier talking or yelling. It might be just fine with an infant since you dont have to hear what they are saying. Even now it is only one to two feet away and it is difficult to understand him. One of the cameras has a constant ringing noise that is annoying. I am going to call Lorex and see if they have a solution or if they can send a new one. It isn't so bad if you have it only come n when there is a noise, but if I had to listen to it all the time it would drive me crazy. I tried shutting off all background noise and it was still there. The other camera doesn't have this problem and I haven't tried to switch rooms yet to see if it is due to interference.I would highly recommend this product to anyone who needs to monitor two children and even talk to older children.

I bought it to replace our Summer video monitor that we have been using for our almost 3 year old son since his birth.  We had gotten so used to the defects that we had with the Summer monitor that we really had no idea what we were missing!  The Summer had started losing sound a lot or only having static unless the volume dial was turned to exactly the right spot and had to be turned on and off sometimes to get the video to come back on.  We had been sleeping to a lot of interference and static every night.  We bought this monitor because of the split screen option with the second camera since we have another baby on the way.  The Lorex monitor seems to be just what we were looking for!  No interence or static - which has been soooooo nice.  I love that it has a docking station.  The video is good quality - a step up from our old monitor.  It beeps if you get out of range which is nice too (I tested it while letting the dog out) and is better than the increasing level of static I got with the other monitor.  The feature that I am most surprised to like is the intercom feature.  I didn't think we would use it and was scared that if I did my voice would sound like Darth Vader and scare the mess out of my son.  Well the other night he was supposed to be in bed and he got up and turned on his light and I decided to try it.  You have to talk softly because it is sensitive to volume - but my voice came thru clear as a bell and he jumped back in bed.

No, we use this unit to monitor dogs!  Now before you go off on me, keep in mind that our dogs are treated far, far better than many babies and children we see around us today.  Our dogs are part of our family and treated as such.As to this unit:  It was everything we wanted in such a device and actually works for us better than we anticipated.Set up was such that even a very low tech person such as myself had absolutely no problems what so every.  The instructions were well written, very precise and I had absolutely no problems understanding them...a rarity for me.  I was able to understand how to operate this contraption will little effort.  Yes, it took a bit of figuring out, but that was a rather painless process.We found the sound quality to be quite good for our needs. When the new Boston Terrier pup starts rearranging the kitchen trash when we are not in the room, we hear it instantly.  Our bedroom is quite far from the kitchen so we were please with the range.I love the ability to take snapshot with this unit!  While the quality of the picture certainly is not that of my old Nikon FA or that of my wife's fancy digital that I had to take out a second mortgage for, it is acceptable and we are able to get many candid shots that we simply could get not other way.The night vision on this unit works quite well and very little light is needed for it to be effective.The camera portion of the unit is a bit top heavy and you have to take care how you set it or it will tip over.  For our purpose the mounting bracket was not applicable.  I got around this by using strips of removable Velcro on the surface the camera was to be attached and on the bottom of the camera.  This works out well.I was quite happy with the two-way communication device. A sharp voice command such NO! and or BAD DOG! was quite effective.Overall, I am quite satisfied with this product.  If I were to use it to monitor babies, I feel I would like is for that function too.  Could this device be better?  Of course it could.

No worries-we just slap it in \"power save\" which shuts off the video but keeps playing the audio-and if the baby makes a noise you hit any button on the reciever and the video comes on. This unit has an amazing night vision and the camera comes paired up from the factory-you can even add 3 more cams. The width of the camera angle seems just right and it has many mounting possibilities. You'll likely want to screw it down because the weight of the cord can topple it off your baby's bed easily.

We have 2 separate units and they don't show interference with each other unless they are touching. In fact you can have 2 cameras connected to 1 monitor so you can watch both kids at the same time (you just can't hear them both at the same time). You can hook 4 cameras up (lol incase you decide to have 2 more kids).Now I LOVED my summer infant monitor! It had a big screen and a hand held and other than the fact I dropped it down the stairs and the the hand held broke I probably wouldn't have purchased another one.This monitor has a strange - almost delayed look to it. It's not that big of a deal it's just something I'm not used to (summer infant was a bit crisper). It has a cool feature that you can talk to the kids in their rooms through the camera which I've used often (great for telling them to go back to bed). The camera itself is a round circle of lights- a bit of a distraction for the kids... until they get used to it (or we put duct tape over the light like we did with the summer infant camera light). The camera is a bit top heavy... attaching it to a wall works great in my son's room. My husband has my daughters camera set up on her curtain... but I'm not sure it will stay very long (it might end up on the wall as well).The monitor says you can take pictures of the kids through the camera... but I can't see the quality being very good (they're in the dark for goodness sake). We haven't tested that feature out- I'm not sure we ever will since that's not why we purchased it.This was the ONLY secure monitor I could find on the market. And after there was a news feature about people linking into non-secure baby monitors I didn't feel very comfortable with the summer infant one.We (or shall I say I since I'm the one who monitors the kids during the day and night) still have to get used to it. It's a bit more delicate than the summer one (lol I used to just roll over and hit the top button to check on the kids) it's kind of like a cell phone, it has smaller tiny buttons. On the plus side it does take up less space on my night table.  But since it is so small it only has 4 voice levels.  So when I'm taking a shower while the kids are napping... I can't always hear them over the water (even when the volume is up all the way).The reviews online said that the customer service wasn't very good- but I gave them a call and although they were in another country (I could tell by their voice) they answered my question without any problem. My question was if you had 2 cameras hooked to one monitor did you hear both audios? you can only hear the camera hooked up to camera 1... so we decided to purchase 2 monitors (specifically for night time). Amazon had a deal going where they were $99 per set (cheaper than the summer infant i had).** After using these monitors for a few months we've found they KILL our wireless connection.  It only happens when they are both on (I have one turned off right now to write this review).  It happens when the monitors are too close together.  So if I put one across the room my connection is ok (but what's the point of that when I'm trying to monitor BOTH kids).  No one else mentioned this in their reviews but than again no one was using 2 separate units to monitor 2 kids.  Due to this issue (we ONLY use laptops in our home) I doubt I would have purchased this monitor.  It can be quite a pain in the you know what when you're trying to do something on line and your connection stops because the monitors are on.  So beware... if you're buying more than one entire unit... your internet connection may be compromised.I know this was long winded but I though you should know the details. A monitor needs to last a long time and they aren't cheap. Buying the right one is always a challenge.

We've always had regular audio only monitors.  I never bought a video monitor because I was concerned about a) resolution/field of vision in the dark and 2) brightness/flashing lights on the nursery monitor at night.  The Lorex exceeded my expectations on both points.  The resolution is great at both 3-4 feet (looking into the baby's crib) and at 12-20 feet (in our toddlers' room).  In the dark you only see the one small red light and a very faint red ring of lights, it is very subtle and our children don't even notice it.The package includes 1 monitor unit/camera (with removable powercord) and 1 handset (with charging base and cord).  We love the unit so much we bought a second camera to use in the baby's room and have considered buying a third for the playroom.  Here is a run down of the pros and cons.Pros:- very compact monitor unit(s) and handset, hardly noticeable in a nursery- easy to setup single or multiple rooms- easy to program handset- audio feature on the handset lets you project your voice from the monitor in the kids room (\"please sit down and go to sleep!\")- excellent near/far resolution in both daylight, low light and darkness- the cord charges the monitor unit so if you lost power (or chose to unplug it while your child naps) you would still be able to see them- monitor camera swivels so you can position it (up/down/left/right) to see the child- great battery life- easy to switch between camera views on the handset (there is even a setting that cycles through the camera views every 2 seconds)- no interference or reception issues in our house (thick plaster walls and lots of wifi, bluetooth, wireless phones, etc.)- volume, resolution, sensitivity, etc. are easy to control on the handsetCons (pretty minor):- handset is not flat on the bottom so you can't sit it up right or on it's side when it's not in the charging base- the volume control on the handset doesn't allow for different volume or sensitivity settings for different rooms, but they are easy to adjust- the handset drops in to the charging base, but you have to line it up and push it down so the plug inside the charging base goes into the handsetIn short, the pros strongly outweigh the minor cons (mostly just things that would have been nice to have).  I love this product and would highly recommend it to anyone considering a video monitor - especially if you need to see children in multiple rooms and only want to carry one handset.

When I saw this one, I thought that in 3 years there must have been a jump in video technology, so we decided to \"upgrade\". That didn't turn out to be the case with this Lorex monitor.It has a lot of really great features:- The handheld unit is smaller than my smart phone- Ability to expand to 4 cameras- You can talk through the monitor into the room (which actually just served to freak my baby out instead of calming her, but would be good for older kids)But also some \"not quite there yet\" features:- The lowest volume setting is still very loud in the middle of the night, so it wakes up both of us instead of just the parent on \"baby duty\". I like how low I can set the Summer volume.- When the picture is \"on\", the monitor emits a low \"buzzing\" noise- Picture could be clearer/LCD screen could be clearer- Battery life should be longer - Summer can last all day on power save without being recharged. Lorex - only a few hours.- Camera unit \"head\" is really heavy! It won't stand up by itself if you don't anchor it down. Not really an option in the location that we want to place it, so we had to weight it down by putting something heavy on the small base.We have been using this monitor for a couple of months now, but I'm ready to switch back to our beloved Summer instead.", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Reasonably priced with some good features", "Author": "Jonathan T.

We had been using a separate baby monitor/web cam solution for a while and this really works out better.Pros:- Uses an fairly standard mini-USB style connector for charging which means that you can actually charge using a variety of chargers (including a computer). This is very nice.- Both the monitor and the camera use the same charger too.- The camera also has a battery in it, so you can take them with you on a trip and you don't have to be plugged into power the whole time.- The infrared night-vision is quite good.Cons:- They added the ability to capture stills to an SD card, but they're really low resolution captures. It's a pretty useless feature in all.- The monitor is fairly low resolution, I'm not sure if the camera's output is low, but the monitor on the baby cam is. They don't publish the resolution, but it's probably 240x160.- The multi-monitor support is nice, but with the buttons so readily available, we're always hitting the button for one of the other monitors, which of course forces it to beep. It would be nice to be able to configure what monitors are available so you don't have to worry about it.- When the camera is charging, there is a bright red LED that shines. It would have been nice if it had been placed somewhere on the back instead so it didn't disturb baby. Luckily it goes out after the camera is charged, so most of the time its not a problem.- The audio has a little more interference than our previous monitor. It's not really a problem, but it is noticeable.- It's nice that the camera has a battery, but it would be nice if the camera had a \"quick disconnect\". If you attach the camera to the wall, you can't remove it easily.Curiosities- With the USB connector on the camera, I'm curious if it will work as a USB webcam as well. I'll try it some time, it would certainly make this more usable when the monitor is no longer needed for baby duty.In the end I recommend this monitor, especially for the price.

We hated it. It got poor reception and every button you pressed made a loud chirping noise- so annoying at night when my husband was sleeping and I needed to press a button or two to view my toddler. Anyhow...when we moved into a new house we got ZERO reception on it. It gave us a \"Out of Range\" warning when I walked more an a couple feet away from the camera. Unacceptable.I called customer service and waited on hold for 20+ minutes. I ended up having to hang up because I couldn't hold any longer. Not happy. I found a customer service email address and decided to write them and tell them about my non-existent reception. I still, to this day, have not received an email back (it was months and months ago). I finally called back and waited 20+ minutes again and talked to someone who transferred me to someone else, who transferred me to someone else, and so on. Just when I thought I was getting somewhere they said I needed to speak to technical support...and they could NOT transfer me...I would have to call back. What?! So, another 20+ minutes on hold. Finally I talked to someone at tech support who agreed my monitor was not working correctly and they gave me a code so I COULD CALL BACK customer service and get a replacement. Oh.my.goodness. SO frustrating. I ended up having to send in my faulty monitor and ONE MONTH later received my replacement by mail. I was without any monitoring (even the poor quality it had was better than no monitor) for over a month. Not cool. My second monitor didn't work either (no reception/poor reception) so it was back on the phone with Lorex. I finally got them to transfer me to a manager who ended up talking me out of returning the whole thing and told me about the new product, the Live Snap. He said it should solve my reception problems. He sent me one and I received it only 5 days later (thank goodness).It didn't work though. Wouldn't even power on. So...back on the phone with the manager. He told me he would send me another one, but they were back ordered and it would be about 3 weeks. Are you kidding me?! Having no choice I told them I would wait for it. I waited and a month later nothing happened. I called them back only to be informed that the manager I was dealing with \"would be gone for the next three months\". Umm?! I was told that their records indicated that I was to mail them back the faulty Live Snap before the replacement would be sent out. ???? Well, I was NEVER told that and now I had wasted all that time waiting for my monitor that wasn't even on it's way. Ugh! I immediately shipped back the faulty Live Snap and did receive my replacement a week or so later. It worked.Upon opening the Live Snap I did like it much better than the original Lorex. It was slimmer and sleeker and the buttons didn't chirp when you pressed them. I hooked it up and set up the VOX feature. I read and re-read the instructions figuring I was doing something wrong because even when my baby (on camera 1) was making ZERO noise it would power on and I would hear room static. No crying baby though...the monitor showed her sound asleep. I messed with camera 2 (my toddler's room) and had worse results since he sleeps with a white noise machine. The monitor picked up the noise and wouldn't cancel it out like it advertised. So if I wanted to view my toddler on camera 2 I would have to listen to his white noise machine. So annoying. So now we don't use the VOX feature at all. Such a bummer too because my old Lorex (original model) had an awesome VOX feature that did work.The reception on this is decent. We have a large house (3,700 square feet) and I can get minimal service in most areas. I can NOT go outside though and that is unfortunate because when my baby is sleeping and my toddler wants to play in the back yard I cannot take the monitor with me out back...I have to leave it in the house and keep leaving my toddler to check on the baby.The two way communication it nice. When my toddler wakes up I can quickly talk to him and remind him to be quiet because his baby sister is sleeping next door (only sometimes does he actually listen, but that's not Lorex's fault. haha).Pros:Sleek handheldGood pictureQuiet buttonsTwo way communicationCons:Range (not even close to 450 feet as advertised)VOX feature is worthlessCustomer serviceI'm over trying to deal with customer service anymore. I'm going to keep this monitor this time, but I just wish it would have worked from the start and I wish it worked as advertised.

I disagree, even at 2am when it is dead quiet it activates constantly. I verified it was not the forced air heating causing background noise.-'Camera Signal- out of three cameras one would lose it's signal inconsistently but often. LOREX supprot said it was interference in the house. I disagree, I tried the receiver/camers pairing process a couple of time with no effect. The problem camera just happenes to be the closest to the receiver (5 to 30'), the other two cameras were even further away and through multiple walls/floors (large house). Sometimes it would loose the signal from just outside the room, about five feet away.-'Receiver Charging Base- this problem is minor but annoyed my wife. The handheld receiver unit fits onto a base unit for handy charging, similar to a wireless home phone. In order to put the receiver into the base you have to align the male charging plug that sticks up from the base into the female port on the receiver. On occasion it will go in easy but most of the time you have to use two hands and make sure the two are aligned.LOREX support is a joke. If you ever need to call them just go out to your vehicle and slam your hand in the door, same feeling.  They are not familiar with the product, I had to explain to them how VOX worked. They read from a script and said a LEVEL II technician will call back in a few minutes. Over two weeks later and only after I posted a bad comment on their Facebook page did they decide to call me back. They were very rude to my wife on the phone and lied saying they have been calling us back repeatedly- they never left a message and the caller id history reveals no such calls.

I need video monitors because I am hearing impaired.  I have three children under the age of four so being able to see (when I can't really hear) is very important. The only con is that the volume when i have my hearing aids out isn't loud enough for me to feel comfortable to hear however I can look at the monitor and see all three bedrooms and see the children and have it set for VOX so it lets me know if there is noise in their rooms by automatically switching views to that room(if I'm in the full screen view), or I can see all three at the same time in the split screen view and it rotates the sound room by room (9 second intervals). But also looking at  the screen you can adjust the volume of each room and see (by little markers on the top of the screen) if there is noise happening even if you can't hear it.. I love the speak to room technology.  I can choose any room to talk to and speak to the child in that room (\"don't do that\", \"get in your bed\"... etc).

Monitor and camera use mini USB connection to power and charge (smart).CONS:If you forget to turn on the camera before you turn on the montior the monitor will beep at you saying \"NO CAMERA FOUND\" and wake up your sleeping baby (sucks).  There is no output to hook up the monitor to a tv. And it would be nice if here was a belt clip and little kick stand built into the back of the montior.CONCLUSION:There are always going to be a few cons on anything if you look hard enough but none of these change my vote that this is a 5 star monitor.  And none of the cons have to do with the quality of the monitor, just requests for the next model.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Baby Monitor - Very Impressed", "Author": "Keribeth", "ReviewID": "R10HY6CTLRTE2V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this monitor expecting to be disappointed, as with all baby monitors I have used in the past. After lots of research and internal debate, I pulled the plug and purchased the Lorex Live Snap. First of all the setup was a breeze. I didnt even have to read the instructions, it was so inuitive. I had three major concerns for any monitor I purchased. Security, compatability with wireless network, and quality of night vision. The security issue is taken care of with the digital signal. No interference from neighbors or problems seeing other people's babies!I set up the camera in the baby's room, took the handset to the living room and set it down next to two wireless laptops and a cell phone. The image was perfectly clear and the sound came through great. We have been using this device for 3 months now and have not yet had any issues with interference. We even took it with us on a trip and used it in two other homes with wireless networks and had no problems whatsoever.Next test was night vision. I am amazed at how well this works. The image is clear (though black and white) but detailed enough for this paranoid first time mom to assure baby is breathing at any time in the night, with blinds closed, no nightlights, complete darkness.Using the handset is pretty easy. It took us a little bit to adjust the volume and the sensitivity for Power Save mode jsut right but after one night of using it, we got the adjustments right and have had no issues. We hear the baby when he stirs and I press the camera button to check what's going on. For us, the display is MUCH too bright to leave on all night, even on the lowest backlight setting. Power Save feature is a must and we always use it. The option of only transmitting sound when baby makes sound is great (VOX). Anyone who has listened to the constant white noise feedback of other monitors will appreciate this feature. Others have mentioned it doesn't work properly for them. Maybe the camera is too far away? Ours works perfectly. If you don't like this feature, turn it off and the camera will transmit sound continuously. Finally, the ability to use up to four cameras on the same handset is fantastic.There are a few issues that I don't find to be a problem but are worth mentioning. The lighting on the camera that makes the night time picture so great, is also distracting to baby if he doesn't want to sleep. I sometimes find him sttaring at the camera watching the lights. It's a tradeoff that I am more than happy with for the ability to see him whenever I need to. Next isue, is the base is too light for the camera. As a renter, I am hesitant to put holes of any kind in our walls, never mind install a video camera, so I have the cmaer standing on a shelf above the baby's crib. the camera is too heavy for the base and unless I put a something on top of the base, such as a bottle of water, it topples over. I don't mind the water bottle solution but others might find this annoying. I never use the snapshot feature but I think the images shown in the marketing material is a little deceiving. At best it is camera-phone quality pictures. Again, we never use this feature so it isnt an issue for us. For me, and compared to the junk that is out there for baby monitors these issues maybe warrant a loss of half a star since there is no perfect monitor out there.We like this camera so much we will be purchasing more cameras for use with the headset. All of my parent-friends that have seen this have been amazed and want one.

We don't mind since we still use the Sony Baby Call monitor for this purpose... as a side note, we absolutely love the Sony monitor and have used it for over 2 years with no problem but wanted to upgrade to video the second time around.  Customer service told us that we simply have a faulty unit which seems to happen to quite a few people concerning one feature or another.  We decided to keep it, instead of having them send a new one, because we knew we could make due without this feature and didn't want to risk getting another one with something else wrong.

I didn't have to enter any type of security code. This is good normally for a baby monitory w/o a camera, but the possibility of someone else with the same product being able to see into my house via the camera leaves me a bit uneasy.The 2 directional talk button is nice. I put the camera in the living room while my child was in there, to keep an eye on her from the kitchen while I was making dinner. Not only could I see her, but I could send a quick, \"get down from there\", when she got on the coffee table.The handset uses a standard mini USB port to charge. This is nice, because you can charge it in places other than the one where you plugged the base in, provided you have computers or other devices with mini USB port connections.The camera base has a lot of room to swivel around which is nice, but the base isn't heavy enough to keep it from tipping over in most positions. The base does have mounting holes in it so that it can be screwed down, but I use them; I liked the ability to move the camera to different rooms as needed.I was happy with the sound.

There are menus and setting on the receiver, and it is easy enough for my wife to set up and figure things out (she isn't tech savvy). The microSD card was in the slot in the receiver already, and its adapter came in the package. Yet it was not easy to take the card out.Battery life.It took several hours to charge both batteries fully, then they lasted over five hours with the vox on (audio activated alerts, the receiver gets alerts when the camera detects audio).Long range reception.We didn't have any reception or interference issues between rooms and other wireless equipments. But when the two units were close, it made howling noises. When the both units are in distance, they are fine. I think that's the nature of microphone and speaker relationship.Snapshot feature with external memory card.One thing I like about this video monitor is that I can take a snapshot with it. The quality of the photos are not that great, but its just snap shot just like the ones from a phone camera. However, it is nice that this monitor also works in the dark like a night security cam. Again, quality is not that great, but this doesn't need to be a HD video monitor. And this monitor does its job well.There are a couple of things I'd like to mention as well. The camera unit is wireless, and it also works in the dark. I thought it would be really nice if it works with the computer as a webcam. I am sure that's more challenging technically, but that's the kind of feature I would like. Another thing is about the battery. It is nice that I can charge the battery and the unit with regular usb cable, but when it comes to irregular type of battery, it makes me wonder why. I think it would have been better if I could just use regular AA or AAA type instead cell phone battery look a like.Lastly, although I do not like the cheap plastic quality of this monitor; however, I give more points for its expandability and two way talking feature. If I want, I can add three more cameras (it will cost a lot more!!!) and use this for other purposes.

I love how you can talk to your child from another room, and have multiple cameras! I have one set up in my 1 year olds room where I can watch him sleep safely in his crib and also watch him play during the day. The second camera I have in my 8 year old daughters room... She used to be scared of the dark but after I installed the camera and I showed her how I can watch her and hear her all through the night she no longer felt the need for lights in her room!! In the morning I also use the 2 way communication to play her favorite songs in the morning to wake her up and I can see when she starts moving. I am able to not yell through the house to tell her when dinner is ready and we absolutly love it!The bad news:It breaks!! With no warning what-so-ever!! One day it works great and the next day you go to plug in the monitor and the port where it goes in is no longer there... It has gone inside of the unit. You can hear it jiggle around inside. It just came loose one day! That happened about 8 month after I first bought it and could not get it replaced because I was in the middle of a move and just didn't have the time. So after living without it for about 6 months I bought another unit... And for 2 1/2 months was very happy again! And then... IT BROKE!! In the exact same spot! The charger port went inside itself and I could no longer charge it! I am right now in the process of foing through Lorex to get a replacement since Amazons 30 day refund is up. I'll have to come back with an update and let you know how my experience goes with Lorex... Wish me luck!Conclusion: I would not but this product again!

It seems like there is a beeping noise from one camera that makes the VOX activate when not needed but the addition of a air filter to the room for white noise seems to drown it out.Don't be fooled by the packaging, the picture you will see is not anywhere near the quality of the photo on the box, but it does work fine as a monitor.Cons: The main issues I have had with this is that the charger connector is a mini-usb plug.  This thing is simply soldered onto the circuit board and has little support.  The stand has the charger part and putting the device into it is not a simple matter of dropping it in.  you have to wiggle it a little.  Over time, the connector breaks loose from the monitor and the battery no longer charges.

I suppose if you convert everything you own to N 5GHz you would have no issues at all.  The old 2.4 GHz is right in the same range.The pros:  The cameras are rechargable, and can be moved around.  The price is good.

We decided to upgrade the older monitor mainly because of the multi-camera capability. After these first months of experience my impressions are:PROS- Multi-camera capability: it really works. We have one camera in our daughters room and another one in our little son's. It works perfectly- Crisp picture (althought the screen is a bit too small)- Portability- 2-way audio: perfect with our little daughter. I can ask her to lay down without having to enter in her bedroom.- Infrared led: it does have a good range and you can see the whole bedroom even in complete darknessWHAT COULD BE IMPROVED- Range: it's amazing I did not see too many reviews putting it as a CON. Our unit fails at only 15ft of distance between the camera and monitor! The product description says the range is 150 feet indoor (clear line of sight required), however 15ft is a joke! This is mainly the reason why I'm giving it 2 stars only. One thing that may explain the difference between my (bad) experience and the average of the other reviews could be brick walls versus dry walls... My apartment has brick (thicker) walls and it may be the reason why the coverage is a disapointment for me...- Vox: does not really work as expected. The screen and sounds blinks intermittently, regardless of the sound level- Battery life: cameras and monitor need to be charging if you want them running all night. Battery lasts for about 3 hours only.Bottom line: if the range were at least twice wider I'd give it a 4 star.

I bought this Lorex bc we are having another baby and I was having a hard time finding an additional camera for the summer. I just figured I could buy a lorex or separate video monitor and just carry around both monitors to save money.Well, you cannot have 2 different monitors. Or, these 2 were not at all compatible with one another. There was major interference. It's going back. The other issue I have with the lorex is there is no kick stand you have to put it on the upright charger which is very flimsy too.Maybe if I had purchased the Lorex with 2 cameras the first time that would work but I can tell you from testing it that it's inferior to the Summer brand. You can visibly tell by the weight and the buttons that it is much cheaper. One other thought... I did buy the Motorola video monitor as well, it's green and white. The motorola video monitor is about $85 on amazon and it worked far better than this lorex with less interference. There was a litte interference with the Motorola but it definitely worked.If I could do it all over right now I would just buy the Summer Infant Baby Touch monitor.... it's one of their newest models, has every feature, and you can always add an additional camera with that model.

With this camera we've discovered that she sleep screams- all those times we'd run in to \"rescue\" her we discovered we were just waking her up!Anyway, I also didn't think I'd use the microphone feature, but I've found myself using it quite often- although she was quite confused at first, she listens to us now when we tell her to lay down and go night-night.On a totally unrelated note, I get to see my daughter sleep!  She's NEVER been one to fall asleep in my arms unless she's sick, so it's so fascinating to see her in her sleeping element.

That's not been a problem at all.  This is super easy to set up and to use.  The best feature is that it is so portable.  If I want to monitor something other than my child's bedroom, it only takes seconds to set it up somewhere else. My 22 month old son seems amused that I can \"talk\" to him using this system.  It actually works when I say \"get back in bed\"!  The cons as mentioned by many others is that there is no way to stand the monitor up if it's not in the charger.  Some sort of easel on the back would have been nice.  Also, do not buy this expecting to get any good snapshots.  That's kind of a worthless feature.

I had been casually browsing for either a video monitor or intercom to use with my 4 year old and almost 2 year old. I'd like to be able to check in on them real quick while they are playing in their rooms, and it has also come in handy while my 4 year old is taking a bath and I have to tend to my youngest. That way I can still keep an eye on both!At the time that I purchased this, I also went ahead and bought an extra add-on camera as well. I might end up buying one more too, but for now, two seems plenty to juggle.Getting the add-on camera to \"pair up\" with the monitor took quite a few tries. The directions say to hold the monitor and camera about a foot apart but after many tries I kept bringing them closer and closer until they were practically touching before they would pair up--so, be patient with that!There is a feature on the monitor that allows you to snap pictures but I'm not sure what this would really come in handy for. The pictures are not good quality. Maybe if you want evidence of one kid hitting another... lolIt is very nice to be able to switch back and forth between cameras, so you can have two set up in one room to cover more angles, if you like. I'd say in a standard bedroom you can see about half the bedroom, so it's not a wide angle and you won't get a whole lot in view depending on how you set up the camera. Also, it takes about six hours to charge up the cameras, but you only get anywhere from two hours to five hours of life out of them, so it's not good for all night long. That's why I think it's better for daytime naps and checking in on kids playing. It would be nice if you could have just set up the camera and left it plugged in so you could just switch on the monitor anytime you wanted to look in. The audio is not great for listening in--which is why I would not use it for an infant unless you also use a separate audio monitor. We've had the Safety 1st audio monitors (that are only $15 to $20) and those work great for picking up every single little noise. (I can hear what's going on OUTSIDE my son's bedroom window too!) I noticed that the audio works a little better on the add-on camera than the one the monitor came with too. I anticipated maybe getting more frustrated with customer service if I tried to exchange it and decided I could live with it for what I like to use it for. There is also a VOX feature that allows you to have the monitor on \"power save\" and the video will just come on when there is noise in the room. I did not find this to work very well and would just keep going on and off every few seconds--that will not save the battery! The feature I like the best is the ability to also TALK to my kids--so it kind of works as an intercom too! That has to be my favorite part!! That is another reason why I think it's better for use with toddlers too.Overall I'm pretty happy with it, but there are things that would definitely make it better and worth the usual price of about $130. Seems like the add-on cameras could come down a bit in price too. If they were $50 each I'd probably get two more with no problem. Oh well!

I've been thru 3 Summers in 3 years- they always start out great but end up getting static and the battery loses charge.  So we finally made the switch to a whole different brand and we love it.  Like other people have said- it does interfere with the wireless internet making web sites load very slowly but only upstairs where we have it plugged in. Our signal is kinda weak up there anyway so it doesn't take much for the wireless to go slow.  When we have the hand held with us during naps etc there have been no wireless issues.  We have find this to be a very minor annoyance- the pros of the camera far out weigh this problem.We are using 2 cameras with one monitor and the split screen has been great. i LOVE being able to see both kids at the same time b/c sometimes your not quite sure which one coughed or cried out etc.  The visuals are great, sound is great- its what we've been looking for.  My only con is that the speaker is on the back of the handheld instead of the front. This is fine when the hand held is in the charger but when you use the hand held in other rooms or walking around, you have to lay it down on the table with the monitor side down or balance it on its side or else the speaker becomes too muffled.

We are pleasantly impressed after 3 weeks of use.Our goals in buying a baby monitor for \"surprise! number three\" were very simple:*Able to talk to Baby through the receiver*Rechargeable*Easy to move/travel with both base and receiver (with grandparents on both coasts we travel a lot)*Video in color*Current technology, but not looking for the most advanced tech gadget availableThe Lorex was all that and more we found out that we could add up to 4 more video monitors to it so that if we wanted to keep the cameras in multiple rooms we didn't have to move them around. Wouldn't be much of an issue at first as baby is either with us or in the bassinet. However once the crawling starts, it will be nice to add a few cameras to keep an immediate eye without always running around after.The receiver is like a cell phone in look and in feel. Yes, its light and I consider that a plus and not a minus as its very easy to carry around in your pocket. The sound quality is good and the video quality is slightly better than most security cameras. The color makes it easier to watch too. I haven't used the picture taking function on it yet, but I can't imagine its going to be great, as I said its just like a security camera, but I'll post another time if it actually works better. The nighttime vision is a great feature and has saved us from running up the stairs a few times already. With all the worries that we have even though this is number three, its nice not to stress out everytime baby cries because we can just take a look on the Lorex.Suggestions for future editions:A kickstand - when you're doing anything involving your hands and you want to take a quick look, you can't just peek over at it. It doesn't stand up by itself easily.Mute - since I carry it with me all the time if I'm on the phone I'd like to be able to mute it quickly. The sound will go down quite a bit, but this is a suggestion.Bottom line - we'd buy it again. It hit on all our requirements and surprised us with good night vision as well.

Well, sadly, Lorex says that because it's digital, that it's secure.  That is a misleading.  Digital signals can be snooped, just like any wifi signal from a non-secure wireless router.  Notice how Lorex never says what it's secure from?  Well, most truly secure wireless signals are encrypted.  Look up the word \"encryption\" on wikipedia.  Lorex never states the signal is encrypted, just that it's secure.  They want buyers to believe that since it's digital, and not an analog signal, that it's secure from eavesdroppers.  I don't know if any truly secure video baby monitors actually exist yet, but I'd avoid being complacent regarding security assertions when reading the Lorex product descriptions.

Unfortunately, since I have such a big room, I can only see the middle of the part of the room.... disappointing since it's such an amazing camera otherwise. With that said, the camera suits my needs, since it gives me a general idea of what's happening in the room. For a baby's crib, it wouldn't be an issue at all.... but if you have twins, you definitely need two cameras.The talk-back feature is AMAZING!

The Lorex \"Snap\" monitor is, as of the writing of this review, the greatest thing since sliced bread as far as video baby monitors are concerned. With the knowledge that all I can reasonably compare it to is an outdated model, I would like to explain why I am so impressed.After opening the box, my first impression left me feeling that the screen on the monitor is too small. Having now utilized the product, I can confidently say that the screen is the perfect size. That is, the field of vision covers more than enough area and the smaller screen allows for true portability, which leads me to the next positive. This product is truly portable. While the camera/cameras can be mounted to a wall (and easily removed), the design allows for set up on any flat surface. The monitor itself is about the size of a large cell phone and, with its convenient charging port and seemingly long battery life, can be brought just about anywhere due to its wireless operation. The camera also provides a great picture even when the lights are turned off and it automatically transitions into night vision.All of these points certainly make this product great but, in comparison with the old model, there are three features that really impress me. The first being the fact the audio monitor is two way. With the touch of a button on the handheld monitor, crystal clear audio can be heard through the camera just as well as it is being received. Another big advantage, to me, of the Lorex monitor is that it allows room for growth, enabling up to four cameras to be monitored on the same handheld device. While I have only utilized one camera with this unit, I like the fact that I have options if I need them.

I've had various audio baby monitors, which I liked, but they always crackled way too much, and obviously I couldn't see what my daughter was doing.  I did a lot of research before buying a video monitor because I heard awful things about other video monitors losing signals within a few yards of the camera, so I was pleasantly surprised when I got this one set up that I did not have any audio crackling problems or issues with losing the video signal.I don't really use the picture capture feature and I haven't called customer service yet, so I can't speak about those things, but what I can say is that what this monitor is really supposed to do, it does it well.  I love that the monitor is small and wireless (about the size of an ipod), and having the two-way audio will be nice if I need to use it as an intercom when my daughter gets older.The only thing I would change is, while it's nice that the camera is able to bend and move in almost any direction, it's not easy to position the camera in a useful position without mounting it using the screw mount on the back.  Once we solved this problem, though, by mounting it to the side of the crib and pointing down slightly, we have had no further issues with any part of the monitor.The battery life doesn't last forever, but it does last pretty long, depending what power saver setting you have the screen on.  I also like that I can have the audio monitor on all night and then just click on the video screen when I want to check on her.  The volume settings are appropriate, and, as long as you plug the monitor into the dock at night (exactly like charging an ipod shuffle), you won't have a problem with the battery.Overall, 8.5/10... if it broke tomorrow, I'd buy another one right away.UPDATE:  Okay so about a month ago, the power cord for the camera broke (probably my daughter's doing) and I was, sadly, without a video monitor for a few weeks.  I called Lorex and, after being on hold for a while, I got a guy (who was in Canada and spoke perfect English) on the line who told me the product had a one year warranty and if I would fax him a copy of my proof of purchase and a brief description of what exactly I needed, he'd send out a new cord right away.  I faxed it at the end of the day on a Friday and then called back on Tuesday to make sure they got the fax.  After a much shorter hold time, I got a different guy who looked up my account and said the cord was already in the mail and would be there in about 7-10 business days.  It came about 6 business days later, however the cord did not work.  I think, when the first cord broke, a little piece of metal got stuck in the camera preventing the camera from working.  I was going crazy without having the video monitor (my two-year-old just discovered getting out of bed 10 times a night), so I bought a new camera from Amazon at my own expense, figuring when I warranty the old camera, I'll just have two.  The new camera paired with the old monitor very easily and worked perfectly.Overall, I'm pretty impressed with Lorex's customer service, particularly in light of all the negatives said about them on Amazon.  I wish they would have express-shipped the cord to me so I didn't have to wait as long, but they still got it to me within their timeframe.

A few years ago it had features that really no other monitor had.  As others pointed out, the snapshot feature is a joke, but it turns out the construction quality is the real killer.  The plastic shell is a bit cheap, and the circuit board isn't mounted inside the shell very well, which makes for a pretty fragile video monitor.  After sinking a fair bit of money into this system, Lorex's terrible customer service has made me regret every penny.So the full story is that I have actually bought this product twice - once a few years ago through COSTCO and once 8 months ago through Lorex (with only one camera).  I liked the monitor while it was working, though at this point, there are alternatives with all the same features and more.  The first video monitor stopped working last spring, so I quickly bought a new one on the Lorex site.  The USB connector of that video monitor broke  last month after ~6 months of normal use, which was a little disappointing.  The real kicker has been that Lorex customer service has been the worst customer service experience I have ever had, which is saying something... I thought AT&T; would surely be reigning champion there. :-)Almost  a month ago I called Lorex customer service to ask for a replacement as soon as possible.  I spent a good chunk of time with them on the phone.  They took my credit card information to place a hold charge so they could send a replacement immediately, and they would remove the charge once they received my old unit.  They said they would email shipping instructions for the old unit.  After the phone call, they did absolutely nothing.  No email, no shipment, no charge on the credit card.  I waited 3 weeks for some sign of life.  I submitted an online ticket a week ago, which has also been completely ignored.  I called today a couple of hours ago, and after finally getting a customer service representative on the line, she put me on hold but must have accidentally sent me to voice mail.  I left call back information, but have gotten no response.There are great alternatives on the market now to this monitor.  You take a gamble if you buy a Lorex product.  If you have an issue, you will have a hard time getting any help.  It was pretty disruptive for my kids to not be able to use the monitor to communicate with us like they were used to.

With that being said, I did keep the monitor and I use it for some of its features because I frankly can't find another monitor system with these features.Pros:1. The camera can operate on its battery (I occasionally move the camera to the car to monitor the kids if they fall asleep on the way home and I don't want to disturb their naps)2. It can have up to four cameras connected at once (I have 3 children under 3 all in different bedrooms, and all bedrooms are far from the master bedroom and I would never hear them without some sort of monitoring)3. Monitoring continues even if the electricity goes out - of course only until the batteries die (my Sony monitor shuts off completely if we lose electricity)4. I like that I can talk to the kids if I need to, however I don't use this feature often5. This is the first video monitor system that I have ever purchased, and I like having the option of looking in on the kids whenever I want6. It easily recognizes when to switch from day to night monitoring.Cons:1. The signal is very poor. I do live in an all brick house with some brick interior walls between bedrooms, and the master bedroom is on the opposite side of the house than the bedrooms; however, this monitor has the worst reception of all of the monitor systems I've tried. I can only get reception to just inside our bedroom door, which is a long distance from our bed. Therefore, I have to get out of bed to view the monitor, and it is harder to hear if someone is crying.2. The speaker is on the back and blocked when it is cradled in the charger, making it hard to hear3. The loudest setting is not very loud, all other monitors I've used you could turn the sound up much louder than this one can go4. The brightness of the monitor is annoying, even on the lowest setting. I lights up our whole bedroom even though it is far away from our bed. We have to place the unit face down when we are sleeping.5. The VOX doesn't work, even if you use it on only 1 camera. The screen and background chirping noise shut off for mere seconds before they come back on and stay on for about 8 seconds only to then shut off again momentarily. This happens over and over continuously while in VOX mode and is just plain annoying.6. The battery doesn't last very long, maybe 4 hours off of the base.7. When the battery dies the unit just shuts off, no warning beeping, nothing...just shuts off. I feel this is the most dangerous thing about the monitor, because I have a few times had it off the base thinking that I was monitoring a child only later to find out that it had shut itself off without warning. My Sony monitor beeps numerous times warning you that the battery is getting low - a pretty standard feature with monitors.8. There is a persistent chirping noise that never goes away. I guess making it a good thing that we have to have it so far away from our bed, because this is annoying as well.9. The video and audio are choppy, just plain and simply not a continuous feed.10. There are no lights indicating that someone is crying.11. The camera cord is short, I'd like to be able to mount the monitor high and in the corner so that I can get a good view of a majority of the older kids' bedrooms but I have been unable to get as good of a view as I would like.So although I have a video monitor in each of the kids' rooms so that I can look in on them if I want to; I actually monitor the baby with my sony audio monitor, which has awesome sound pick-up and a great voice activated system. I would not recommend using this monitor solely for any baby under 1 because you frankly can't hear them well enough. I use it for my older kids because they sleep through the night and I basically just need to look in at them to make sure they are asleep in their beds, and to see when they are awake in the morning. A pretty expensive investment for something that can't meet all of my needs.

As you can see, I bought this camera earlier this year. About 6 months ago to be exact. Since then I've had to replace the camera and the monitor portion just recently broke. The monitor base, where it connects to charge the camera, was placed at an awkward angle making it hard to get on. I struggled with this from the beginning but thought I'd get the hang of it. No, that didn't happen. Every time I put the monitor on the base it takes a lot of fumbling around. Finally, last night, the connector piece on the monitor just caved in - no doubt this was due to the shoddy design. I don't understand why anyone would design this so that these two piece would have to connect at an angle?Aside from that, I've increasingly had trouble with interception. If your house it set up with wireless access, and the monitor is too close to a device like a laptop, you might lose your connection to the wireless. I'm not quite sure how this works but I'd constantly have to move the monitor away from my laptop so that I could get onto the internet. Again, technologically this makes no sense. But I consistently had to move the monitor away from my laptop to connect.The last thing that started to happen was that the monitor and camera began to lose connection. Over and over again and I couldn't figure out why. It would go out every 5 seconds. I'd have to go up into the baby's room and jiggle the camera and it would after several minutes, mysteriously start to work again.Now, like I mentioned above, the monitor is unusable now because it is not chargeable. I guess I should have waited a few months before writing my first review. These cameras/monitors are shoddily designed and built and I can't see them lasting for more than 8 months.-------------------------------------------------------Before having this monitor I wrote monitors off as just another unnecessary gadget intended to fleece anxious parents. But with a two-story house and unpredictable napper on my hands, this camera really gave me a level of freedom I didn't have sans camera. Reception is generally good although the screen goes black from time to time (I just turn the monitor on and off again and the picture is back). I love the two-way speaker function so I can assure the little one that I'm nearby. The portability is a big plus and it doesn't need to be charged too often. It's simple to use and has a lot of functionality for the price. it does have a couple of annoying design flaws with they could have easily remedied with a few real-life tests. As someone mentioned in another review (one that I ignored obviously) the red and green lights on the front can be a distraction for a sleeping baby. If my baby rolls over and happens to see the light, he's immediately alert; the next thing I see is a little open, drooling mouth coming towards the camera. The lights could have easily been placed on the back or the side. Also, if you turn on the monitor and the camera happens to be off, it makes an annoying beeping noise. This too will wake up light sleepers. The monitor already tells you that the camera is off; why the beeping? despite these shortcomings, I'm quite happy with it.", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't love this", "Author": "Elaine", "ReviewID": "RS1YA3DCF6NX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this monitor after a friend raved about it.

I wanted specific functions, namely being able to watch 2 rooms at one time, which this monitor does and it is the only monitor that I could find which is capable of this.  Other monitors will switch back and forth from room to room but not show 2 (or more) at once.I read all the other negative reviews about this monitor before buying but decided to take my chances because of the functions I wanted.  The other reviews were absolutely correct!  This monitor is junk!  For the price it is the worst made device I've ever purchased!  Cheap, cheap, cheap.  First of all when I first purchased it the parent's unit wouldn't charge, it took 3 days before it charged enough to take it off the charger.  Second, one camera wasn't paired up with parent's unit, which it was supposed to be and it took another day to figure this out because, of course, when I was trying to set them up I had 2 tired kids ready for bed!!  It did come with instructions to pair them so that was a bonus and eventually it did work, when I didn't have the kids screaming at me!!  The parent's unit sometimes doesn't pick up the cameras so I have to turn it off and then back on again, and usually I have to do the same thing when turning them on before bed because there is such a delay from picture to parent's unit, it's like using dial up on skype!!  It so far works better when I reboot the parent's unit though, hopefully it continues to work but I have my doubts because of the poor quality of the device.  The volume is really low too, even when it's turned up it's not that loud.  I can also only get about 3 hours out of a charge up which is alright too, I don't usually need any  more than that.  As far as the customer service, that too is lacking, which again I was warned about.  I sent them an email 2 days after buying the monitor regarding the battery not charging and still haven't heard back from anyone, seems it just went into cyberspace.So, in summary I was warned, I knew what I could be getting and I got exactly that.  Even though it is very cheaply made and Lorex has horrible customer service I got what I wanted, to be able to see both my babies at one time, or one room at a time if I like too. For that one aspect of the device I am very happy with and am glad that I purchased this model.

First, you can see multiple rooms with add-on cameras, great if you have more than one kid to watch/listen for. Second, you can TALK to your kids, great for the older one (\"Stop climbing on the shelves.\" \"No, you cannot come out to get pajamas for your doll.\").  It is pretty reliable and easy to use, the picture is pretty clear and in the daytime, the color is better than on other monitors I have used. The small size is great, fits in your pocket, looks like a fancy cell phone, thought the design is a bit confusing. Grandma asks, \"are those numbers on there?\"However, there are a few minor things that would be great for Lorex to fix on their next version. For example, the screen is BRIGHT. If you want to be blinded in the night, go ahead and turn it on without covering the screen. The white logo start-up screen is seriously intense, and the monitoring screen, even at its lowest setting could be used to flag incoming planes. I have even used it as a flashlight to get around at night! Secondly, the range is not so great, in the farthest points within our three story house, it lost connection, and in the yard? well, pretty sketchy out there too. Another bummer, is the controls are cyclical, meaning that if you turn it on, say in the night when you hear baby, and urgently press \"volume down\" to be sure the baby's crying doesn't wake everyone else, if you push it once too far, you go from zero volume to FULL volume. Then there's the charging, the monitor sticks to the base, and is difficult to pull off, sometimes when you dock it, it turns on, sometimes, it turns off, there's always a surprise when you put it on to charge. The 'talk' button also needs to be recessed a bit, I am forever worried I will \"pocked dial\" my baby as he sleeps.And lastly, a big bummer, after just six months of use, it broke. The connector to the charging base spontaneously became loose within the monitor and it would no longer charge. I have contacted Lorex to see if it can be fixed, and may change my rating based on their customer service. But for a product this spendy, surely it should last more than six months. However, even if it can't be fixed, I would get another.

Admittedly, we have a large number of electronic devices in our home, but we couldn't even get consistent coverage throughout half of ~2,000 sq. ft. -- forget any reception as near as the front porch or garage -- and it was spotty on the first floor directly below the toddler's room. In short, the system didn't live up to its claims. This was not only disappointing, but slightly dangerous, as our active 2 y/o boy could get out of his crib and several steps down the hall toward the staircase between dropped frames.One of the few pluses to this system was the volume of the two-way audio (as we had to turn up the sensitivity to get video to maximum). Once we were able to see our son out of bed, he could hear us tell him to get back in from down the hallway -- and most often complied, since it sounded like the voice of G-- Himself booming at him.Don't bother with any expectations of getting a decent actual \"snap\" from this system; the picture quality and capture speed are so low that you won't get much more than fuzz. Sonograms gave better clarity. The monitor quality when receiving a healthy video signal is fairly solid, though the angle of coverage is such that we needed two cameras to see all of a 15' x 20' play room, even when mounted in the corner of the ceiling/wall junction.A note about the charger/camera connection: We needed to mount these wired, as the batteries only held about a three-hour charge with constant use. One day, in a fit of toddler pique I suppose, my son was able to reach up and rip the charging cord out of the cameras, tearing out the mini-USB connector plugs in the process. He didn't disable the cameras; he rendered them useless.All in all, I would NOT recommend this particular model, though I still have enough faith in Lorex (who made it easy for us to buy replacement chargers) to purchase a higher-end surveillance system.

We used command velcro strips to hang them on the wall in the baby's room. Even with the VOX activated the parent unit did use up the battery VERY quickly.

When my twins were younger, they called out in the middle of the night for potty breaks, for their blanket being off of them, for everything! My oldest also sometimes had nightmares so there are plenty of occassions where either my husband or I have to run upstairs in the middle of the night. It was frustrating, until we got this monitor.With this monitor, we can talk to the kids and talk them through whatever it is they need reducing the amount of time we have to run upstairs.

I've used this system this way for a year now.Complaints:1- the monitor has a VOX option. With this, the monitor goes to \"sleep\" (no sound, no picture) unless it detects a noise in any of the rooms. When it detects a noise, the monitor displays the video and plays the sound on that camera. The problem with this is it never worked right from day 1. A particular camera keeps turning on no matter how quiet it is in that particular room. I've played with it, and no, it never worked right. So I don't use this function.2- Camera battery life has gone downhill after a year. When I first got this, on a full charge, the battery exceeded what the package said. On a bright room the battery lasted 4-6 hours. Each camera performed differently though. There is one camera that performs better than the rest and one that is the worst. On a dark room, it lasts about 2-3 hours. Now after a year, there is one camera that dies 15 minutes after I unplug it from the charger.**I've never had a problem with the battery life on the monitor. A full charge can last up to 4 hours.

I used a large, clunky video monitor when I just had one baby, but when it came time to move my little girl from my room to her own, I started looking for a solution that would allow me to see and hear both babies through the night. At the time, this was the only solution I found. I wish I had waited a little longer for some of the other multiple video baby monitors to hit the market. The wireless cameras are great in theory, but in practice not so much. The charge in them wouldn't last the night, so you have to keep the cameras plugged in overnight (it lasts about 6 hours, unless you have it plugged in all the time, then the battery dies and won't last an hour.) The manufacturer recommends not leaving them plugged in all the time. It's not practical to have to in there unplug the camera during the day, then plug it back in during nap time or at night. For some reason, my sons camera will suddenly decide to stop using the plug even though it is still plugged in, and run off the battery....which means that at the most inconvenient times (ie: in the middle of a nap, or in the middle of the night) the camera will stop working and I have to go in there, unplug it from the wall and replug it in. Extremely inconvenient since the plug is behind furniture. I have checked and the plug has always been firmly seated in the wall when the camera dies. Very frustrating. As for the monitor...the speaker is on the bottom back of the unit. Which means it is extremely hard to hear when it is on the bedside table. The VOX system has never worked the way it says it is supposed to, so I just keep the monitor going with sound but with the screen black unless I push a button to see. That works out fine, and I love that it flips back and forth between the two cameras in my children's rooms. I can either see it full screen, or quad screen and it flips back and forth every 8 seconds. That works correctly and it gives me peace of mind. However, now my charger is being picky and not wanting to charge always. I think the wire in the back is loose and if I move it around too much, it looses its connection and stops charging the monitor. Inconvenient when I wake up at 3 am and realize that the monitor has died, and I have to monkey around the charger to get the wire back in the right place so that the monitor will turn on and charge again.All in all, I wish I had gone with a different system, but at the time of purchase, this was the only one I could find that would allow me visible access to both children's room at the same time.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Would not recommend!", "Author": "jes3557", "ReviewID": "RVRBM1KHOT4AN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ok...so let me start out by saying that I NEVER write reviews for products that I purchase, but I couldn't let this one slide.

Second, the monitor makes a horrible cricket-like sound, which makes it darn near impossible to sleep. Third and most recently, the internal USB on the monitor has broken, so the unit won't charge (not that it would ever hold a charge for very long anyway).

The second one I received worked well for three months. My wife and I really enjoyed this product. The video is of great quality, and I love the VOX feature. We can monitor both of our children while they are sleeping, and when there is a noise in the room, the camera immediately comes to life so we can survey the area and address the situation. What happened after three months? My wife plugged in the monitor to the base to recharge, and the USB connection within the monitor broke. As I am an engineer, I examined the unit and found that the USB connection is a very weak point, and that you have to place the monitor 'just so' into its base to recharge. Figuring that it was our fault, I purchased another one for our use. Again, after three months, I plugged it in, (and I am one to be very gentile with electronic equipment, as I consider myself not only an electronic engineer, but a 'techno-geek'), and it broke on me. Same thing - the internal USB connection within the monitor. I have a call now into the company to have that unit replaced. I have since rigged the previously broken unit with my own recharger and am temporarily using that until I hear back from the company.What I like about this unit: The cameras are exceptional for their design. They are portable, battery powered for short excursions from their 'base site' (visiting overnight at grandma's), or when we're at the beach house, we can monitor outside while the cameras are sitting where ever we decide to mount them. The batteries in the cameras and monitors are okay. They last us about four to five hours. The cameras are great at adjusting for different lighting situations, from daylight, to total darkness. I totally love the fact I can 'talk back' to the kids if they happen to get up for something. Sometimes a quick \"it's not time to get up\" in my Daddy voice is all it takes for the wee ones to drop back down and go to sleep for another hour, when they get up unusually early. I love the fact the monitor can monitor up to four cameras at once. Since the kids are now moving all over the place, I can have extra cameras around and monitor up to four at a time (on one screen), and easily select which camera I wish to monitor full screen.What I don't like, is what I've already explained. I feel that if the company can devise a more robust USB base within the monitor itself, then this would be a perfect product. Until then, I'm left with a jerry-rigged unit until they respond about my second broken unit.I did a lot of research before purchasing this unit - and I still think it's a great concept, just a weak point in engineering.", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worked for a while...", "Author": "Joel", "ReviewID": "R14K9J28RY7FHH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This monitor worked well for about a month.

The first was the Summer Infant Slim & Secure. It worked until she was 18 months old. The monitor itself crapped out, we got a new battery, but it still wouldn't charge.  So we got a Lorex. It was great for 4 months, but the screen on the Lorex just went white. I can hear my daughter, but I can't see a darn thing. I called the company, they told me that I had to send it back to them, but first I was to fill out paperwork that they would email me within 3-5 business days. It has been 7 business days. Their customer service is terrible. I was just on hold for another 20 minutes and didn't even get through to someone.While this monitor looks cool, it feels cheap. I would go back to Summer Infant if I have to buy a third monitor, which I will probably end up doing in the long run.I swear they make them cheap so you have to buy new ones yearly!!!", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice product...when it works.", "Author": "Oliversmama", "ReviewID": "R4Q1LLYRSBJ1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "So we first purchased this video monitor in july 2011.

When in this setting the screen should only turn on when a noise such as crying turns it on. Well ours was cycling on every minute or so even when the baby was sleeping in his quiet room. These issues were affecting our sleep so I contacted Lorex customer service for a replacement.Lorex makes you jump through so many hoops to get your product replaced! I spoke several times to customer service reps and and emailed back and forth with my product info and finally recieved permission to return product for replacement. I sent the product back on my own dime and after 3 weeks of dealing with it, i finally got a new monitor. Except it wasn't new. It was broken right out of the box. The usb port on the monitor was broken and rattling around in the monitor so there was no way to even charge it! I was so mad! I tried calling Lorex but it was a holiday(columbus day) so decided to call amazon.Amazon's customer service is the shining light in this situation. Customer service rep Andre was so helpful! I told him my problem and he told me they were sending me a new monitor free of charge and second day shipping. He also said I didn't have to return the old monitor and could dispose of it at my conveinence. You better believe i took a baseball bat to it, Office Space style!

Sometimes he would cry because he didn't want to go to sleep, but sometimes he would cry when he backed into the crib and would get his leg stuck.  We needed a way to tell the difference so that we didn't go in his room at every cry.  This monitor did the trick.  It was a breeze to set up once we decided where we wanted it.  Another plus:  although it plugs into the wall and runs off of electricity, it continues working even when the power goes out.  Our audio monitor has to be turned back on manually once the power comes back on, which would wake our son.I should mention that I am not crazy about the button that allows you to talk to the baby.  My husband thinks it a great toy and talks to our son.  He has scared him more than once.The range on this monitor is not great, either.  We have a large, two-story house.  My son's room is upstairs, at the opposite side of the house from the front porch.  We cannot use the monitor on the front porch.

Like, the case broke completely open (it was already loose around the corners for some reason), the LCD screen came off, the keypad, the charging port, the speaker, the little board, every single piece came apart as if it had been blasted apart with dynamite.  I would never expect to PLAN on dropping our monitor 6 feet off the stairs, but, our old school Fisher Price audio only monitor that is 4 years old and survived 3 children has fallen from the TOP of the stairs and it still works great. My cell phone, my Kindle, remotes, you name it, my kids (4, 2, 7 months) have dropped it or launched it off the stairs, and the Lorex monitor is the only device to suffer from it.  I need more durability from our electronic devices than Lorex can offer I believe, as all the pieces are very light weight plastic shells, and even one of the cameras lost a charging port (not sure what else to call it, the little port like a USB where you plug the cord in to charge it) a couple of weeks ago.Also, something to take into account, the cords for the cameras are not long at all, 5-6 feet I believe, and for us that really limited where we could place the cameras.  And a very small but highly irritating problem we had, the little template that comes with the mounting kit for the cameras was not accurate.  We received 3 different kits with our 3 different cameras, and none of them allowed us to mount the cameras correctly.  Each time we had to drill, adjust and redrill.Overall, I really liked the concept behind the cameras, I loved being able to have up to 4 cameras mounted and be able to see all of them at once or cycle through them automatically.  The audio was a little fuzzy, and not very loud, but if it had been durable I would certainly have been happy with it.  i loved the 2 way talk feature, and my kids miss it now.  As it is now, I've spent $250 on this set including the replacement monitor (I originally got the 2 camera set on Amazon for $149) and am now looking to have to spend another $200 or so to get a better set.So, if you have older kids, adults or pets that you need to monitor occasionally, and who will not mess with the mounted cameras or handheld unit, this would probably be a great unit for you.

He will soon be transitioning out of the crib so I wanted to have a way to monitor him as we take on the new sleeping arrangement. I was intimidated by the cost of video monitors, and even less impressed at how many do not have the hand held and only offer the smaller TV size monitor. I came across this monitor and could not be happier with my purchase! I was skeptical with how any handheld screens would come across, but this one is so clear and I can see the kiddo great! The 2 way communication is a great feature that I expect to be extremely useful when taking on the new sleeping arrangements! It was VERY easy to set up, infact I did it without reading the instructions on the initial set up even.

I'm not disgruntled or angry just want others to know what happened to us with customer service with Lorex.  If you are looking at two monitors that are relatively the same, you might want to go with the non-Lorex one just based on customer service.We ordered this product well before our son was due because it was on sale and it seemed like all video monitors had some issue or another.  So we picked one and went with it. When we put it all together when our son showed up, it was pretty straightforward and easy to use.  I thought it was quite logical and did provide some peace of mind on how he was doing without us going in his room. However, the battery would not take a charge at all.  So, it had to constantly be plugged into the base for it to work.  I contacted customer support - ultimately via email because getting them on the phone is difficult.  They did not respond to the first 3 emails either - until I noted it was a warranty issue (be sure to register it for warranty as soon as you get it). I then got a response a few days later asking for additional information (when purchased, etc.).  I responded. A week later I got the same questions. I responded.  A week later I got a request for me to fax the invoice to them.  I did that. A week later I got a phone call asking that I mail the product back to them for a replacement to be sent to me.  No information on where to mail it, what to include, etc.  And never once did anyone apologize for any inconvenience or even act like there was a human on the other end of the conversation.

We've also tried different wi-fi video monitors, all have had failing reception, or simply been awful to use.We found the Lorex via an Amazon Gold Box Deal, all reviews pointed to a video device that would fit our needs - I'm pleased to say that it has. There are many features that we don't use, so I'll focus on the ones that we needed... The color video reception is great, especially considering we operate it at its lowest signal level (1 bar, through many walls and doors);  the camera operation works superbly in the day or night.

Here are my pros and cons from all of one day's use.Pros:-  Each piece is easily portable and while the video quality isn't exactly gorgeous (none are from what I've seen), it certainly does the job.  Just try to avoid setting up the camera where it will be backlit.  I definitely plan on bringing this on trips to visit family so I can keep an eye on them while they're outside playing or when they're out of earshot at bedtime.-  It was easy setting it up for use.-  LOVE the two-way talk feature. My kids don't seem to have any trouble hearing or understanding me.  I was sure to test that out before the novelty wore off and selective hearing was back in full force (they're school-age).  =)-  I like that I can leave the monitor in the charging cradle and still be using it.-  Controls are easy to navigate.Cons:-  If you leave the volume up high, there is a constant hum.  It's not hideous, but it's noticeable enough that I turn it down to the lowest volume setting.  I can still hear a smidge if they're calling for me and then turn it up to converse.  I don't know if it's caused by the wireless internet, cordless phones, etc.-  The monitor doesn't seem to sit very stable in the cradle.  Kind of bugs me, but it still does the job.  Just wish it was snug.-  It would be of better use if the camera angle was horizontal rather than vertical so I could see more of the room.  I really don't think there's going to be a lot to monitor on the ceiling...-  Grainy night video, but that's to be expected.  I have no problem figuring out what I'm looking at in the dark, so it's definitely livable.Other comments:-  Once I read the specs on the photo quality, I didn't even bother inserting the sd card.  Frankly, that's not why I bought it, so it wasn't even a factor in my decision.-  I haven't tried the VOX feature or needed to contact customer service, so I cannot comment on those items.So in a nutshell, it does a great job on what I need it to do...to show me what my kids are up to and allow me to basically have an intercom so we aren't yelling to each other across the house.

We have had it for about a month and here are the pros and cons.I will start with the cons:1. If the baby's room is silent then there is a slight humming noice. (if you have a fan running in the baby's room, or near the camera, then you hear the fan but not the humming)2. If you don't have the camera docked it is hard to see the screen and hear the sound at the same time because you cannot stand the monitor on its end. (But we have gotten around this by putting it into a smaill cup. Plus we don't leave the video playing all of the time so it's really not a big deal)Pros:1. Both the camera and the monitor run on battery so if the power goes out then you can still hear your baby cry.2. The picture is very good even in the dark.3. The monitor is small and easy to take with you around the house.4. If you don't leave the video showing all of the time both the battery in the monitor and the camera will last for quite a long time (some reviews said it wouldn't last through a nap, on the weekends during the day it lasts through multiple naps plus the time that I forget to turn it off).5. The sound is as good as if not better than the sony audio only monitor that we had but we also have the video.6. The cost is reasonable (we got it on amazon for $120)7. You can add up to 4 cameras (we have one right now but we will be adding more as we have more kids).The pros out weigh the cons and the cons have some easy work arounds. We are really happy we got this camera and we would not go back.

After plugging in both the camera and the handset, the handset had no trouble finding the signal from the camera. It had a range or approximately 35 feet through several walls and displayed a picture one would expect from a low resolution camera on a cheap small screen. The night vision worked reasonably well and the sound from the handset was more than adequate. The two-way communication feature did not work well at all. Sound from the handset to the camera was garbled and unintelligible, and possibly fightening to a child. We had not gotten around to trying the VOX or picture taking functionality, though I expect the photos to be near awful.We had no problems with interference from WIFI, cordless phones, and the microwave, though at the moment we live in an uncongested area where we don't have to worry about multi-home residences.The only unforgiveable problem with our unit was the low build quality which caused the unit to last a total of three days. The handset uses a USB-mini-b connection to charge its battery. This is not a problem, but after the three days of normal use, the female end of the usb in the handset broke free into the handset. This made the unit completely useless as we now had no way to charge the battery.I attempted to return the unit to Lorex, but since it was a baby shower gift we had lost the proof of purchase. This was no problem for Amazon though as their customer service gets five stars for providing a return shipping label and will refund the total since we had registered (and the unit was bought) with them.If you are much more careful than my wife and I, sure, get this product and you may be happy.

I will start by saying I wouldn't trade this in for any other. Probably unfair of me since this is my first baby monitor purchase. However, if I had a dollar for every hour I spent researching every monitor on the market during my pregnancy, I would have been able to hire a full time night nurse instead. Ok, slightly exaggerated.I know many complain about it's lightweight monitor, but I don't mind it since it's light enough to carry in my pocket. I have even dropped it a few times and it survived. The night vision is much better than I had expected, and that's good since I don't typically use it during the day. I can't comment on the picture taking quality since I have never used it nor plan to.  I purchased it mainly because of the auto-scan capability, with twins that is extremely helpful. The split screen shows both babies at the same time, and the frame switches from one camera to the next every 6 seconds or so for sound monitoring. This alone sold me on the product. The fact that you can speak into the monitor and be heard through the camera actually comes in handy if I need to communicate with hubby while he's putting the babies down for bed. I tried using the vox once, and it didn't work. I just keep the monitor lit all night instead. I ended up hearing them crying through the walls, but the camera never came back up. So be it. Not a deal breaker for me.The biggest frustration comes from the life of the battery. The first few days, it would last 5 hours out of the charger. That would be plenty of time for the evening until I would go to bed myself, and place it in the charger on my night stand. BUT, as the weeks have gone by, battery life has decreased now down to 3.5 hours. This means that when I put the babies to bed between 7-8pm, I must grab the charger as well as the monitor and bring it downstairs with me. Not that big a deal, I suppose. Cameras therefore are plugged in at all times in the nurseries.Final word about range. We have 3 wireless routers in the house, and a 2 story 3000+ square foot home with plaster walls. Reception throughout the house never flickers. However, as the monitor scans from one camera to the other, it seems there is a subtle cricket-like sound on one of the cameras only. So it scans from complete quiet on one camera to a little hum on the other. Not very loud, but certainly noticeable. Again, no reason to give up on it.Summary: I love it, and would buy it again!", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good, but not wonderful.", "Author": "D.

With a family of 8 (4 of which are kitties :) it is safe to say that we are on a budget.  After reviewing for weeks all the different video monitor options out there, I was hesitant due to the price of the Lorex monitor but figured at least we spent the least we could if it's not what we are looking for.  The customer reviews for this monitor were better than any other that I'd looked into for what is important to us. I wasn't excited about it not being some sassy designed piece of equipment but everything else seemed to check out so I bought it.  Since having this monitor we have not had 1 single complaint or problem.  We live in a 3 level townhome and this monitor is exactly what we needed.  The range is not great outside of the home.  It works on the deck which is over our driveway but it starts to lose picture about 20 feet from the house which is about  40 feet or so and 3 levels up from the camera, a total of about 60 ft and 3 levels.  I wouldn't recommend this monitor if you own to large of a home, but for us it is perfect.  The picture is better than the summer brands I've seen my friends have and the nighttime vision keeps this \"paranoid\" mom at ease.  If I feel comfortable (one who still checks my 8 month old for breathing when she's asleep) then you know this picture is awesome.  SO... In a nutshell, if your looking for a no-nonsense quality monitor and don't care much for perfection elsewhere then this is definitely a monitor you won't regret investing in.  The talk-back feature is awesome and sounds real time.  We are now going to buy another camera for our family room.  I gave customer service a 1 because the reviews say the customer service is awful, but fortunately for us we haven't had to use them and we've had the monitor for about a month now.

Originally I purchased it to replace a baby monitor system that had operated and watched over my babies for 4 years.  Both my husband and I agree that this was one of the best purchases/investments we have made in 2011!The features that initially drew me to this monitoring system was the portability, size, clarity, two-way talk feature, multi-camera view mode and expandibility.  I must report that not only has this system met all of our expectations, but has completly exceeded them!  We use all of the above-mentioned features daily, and could not live without a single one.  Another nice feature we discovered that not only is the hand-held unit rechargable, but so is each camera.  This truly affords more flexibilty indoors and out - what a bonus!We currently have two cameras, and one hand held unit, but are planning to expand to include 2 more cameras.  We have one in the boys' room, and another at the front door.  When first purchased, I temporarily mounted one camera in the livingroom/playroom space.  This is quite a large space, and the camera more than sufficiently viewed the whole area.  During the day, the color is absolutely beautiful, and you can see every detail, even though it's a small screen.  I was able to run outside for a short period say to set out the recycling (good range around the house), and have full conversations with my kids safely in the house or upstairs in their room as they play (and I multi-task).  I can also welcome guests at the front door, or say an extra goodbye as they depart.  What a peace of mind for such an affordable price!I have the main charging cradle above my kitchen sink, so I can view it at all times, and at night I use one of my old mobile phone chargers by the bed - it is a universal compatible port and works perfectly!

Some I agreed with, some I didn't understand at all.  I'm a new father with a 3-month-old child.  Overall, I am happy I bought this monitor.  However, it has a number of minor flaws that you should be aware of.First, I should point out the good:- Night vision is EXCELLENT.  It looks like a bright spotlight is being shined on the baby and his surroundings, but in reality the baby is in a pitch dark room!  I was very impressed with this!  No way that night vision could possibly be any better on any competing monitor.  Furthermore, it does a great job automatically determining the need for the night vision, and quickly swapping between the regular camera mode and the infrared/night one.- Portability is excellent.  It's easy to carry around in your pocket.  Range is reasonable.  My house is well over 4000 square feet and, despite having \"0 bars\" of signal in some rooms, the picture and audio never cut out.- You have the ability to add additional cameras.  They are pricey at $80/each, and I am confused how a seemingly identical product is sold at Costco (same Lorex manufacturer) with 2 cameras included, for nearly the same price.  Anyway, I still like the capability to switch between cameras at the touch of a button, or to see several on a split-screen.The bad:- It interferes with wireless internet!!!  This is really frustrating.  If the handheld unit is anywhere near your laptop, it will either slow down your internet connection or kill it completely -- at least until you shut the unit off.- The VOX feature does not work.- The device emits a high-pitched hum.  This isn't terrible, but it can get annoying if on the upper two volume settings, especially if trying to sleep.- The snapshot thing is a fun toy, but not useful to take pictures that you'd really want to send anyone.  The resolution is poor.OVERALL:  I like the product and it serves its purpose.  I just wish they would have fixed these annoying bugs before releasing it.", "Date": "February 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Couldn't be more pleased", "Author": "Benjamin Caulder", "ReviewID": "R189XTP7XN8DMR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is just a quick little review.

It is great when you want it positioned in a fixed place.  I actually have a tip for installing -- rather than using a permanent screw in mounting, I use museum putty.  The camera is so lightweight that the museum putty has it affixed to the wall for the last two weeks with no problems.  That way, as the baby grows, I can reposition the camera (it does not have zoom)to see more of the baby as she grows.Pros:1.  Great picture.  Better than I thought it would be from a wireless monitor.  One can easily see the baby from the portable monitor.2.  Small, compact monitor with range.  It's about the size of a cellular compact phone.  Easy to carry around with me and use both upstairs and downstairs in my home.Cons:1.  Not portable and difficult to position.  The monitor does not stand up well in a non-affixed position.  It really needs to be affixed to some surface.  This is not as useful in our situation where we are using a bassinet more often than crib.  Also, the camera swivel and angling feature is a little difficult to use -- definitely not something conducive to portability.  In all practical purposes, you will affix the camera to one spot and leave it there.2.  I didn't buy this as a camera, but the fact that you would take snapshots and be able to use them is laughable.  The camera resolution is not snapshot grade.  Don't bother with this feature.3.  Feedback from microphone when monitor is close to camera.  This is annoying -- remember to turn it off when you go into the room with the camera as the feedback can wake the baby when it is close to the camera.Although there are more cons than pros, the cons are minor in comparison.

We needed to get a replacement* Compact, rechargeable camera, and video monitor - it is a bit smaller than the one we have.  The rechargeable camera sounds like nice feature, but I doubt we would use it often enough to make it that valuable a feature.* Snap, store, and share with microSD recording - WOW! I was excited about this feature until I got it.  Was I wrong.  The image quality is not that great in the image, and for the most part I think we'd be taking pictures of sleeping babies in the dark.  In order to take a picture of baby's first steps, you would have to have the camera pointed at them with one hand, and hold the monitor with the other.* Talk with Baby (Two-way audio communication) - Another feature I was looking forward to, but the sound of our voice tended to agitate more than soothe our child.  Most of the time he just wants us in the room for a minute until he falls back asleep.  Our presence was more important than the sound of our voice.* See baby at all times with automatic night vision - This actually works pretty well in comparison.  It reveals images in the dark quite evenly and well.  You really can't tell that the lights are out.  our current monitor doesn't do as well.  It as a bit of a bright spot in the middle of the image.* Secure, interference-free, long-range digital signal - Maybe secure, but the rest was not true for us at all.* VOX - In theory sounds great.  I would love the monitor to run silent unless baby makes a sound, but it did work.  It just kept turning on.* Support for up to four cameras -  Our current monitor can support two cameras.  This feature seems like something you would want more in a security system than a monitor.What they don't really tell you:* The system runs in 2.4GHz radio spectrum.  It did not work well at our house with all the Wi-Fi, cordless phones and etc.  Range was not as far as the one already have, and it had a lot of audio noise.* The system is truly digital.  That means the image is captured, encoded / compressed, and then transmitted digitally like a cell phone.  There is no static.  The signal is either present or drops out completely.  Nothing in between.  The audio quality in either direction suffers a bit from over compression and things sound like they are underwater.  Sort of like a poorly encoded MP3 song.* The monitor is shaped like a small cell phone, but the speaker is on the back.  Seems like an odd place.  You sort of have to choose between looking at the and covering the speaker with your hand, or turning it around to hear the audio and covering the screen.  We heard more random interference noise from the speaker than we heard the baby's room.  I tried turning the volume up, but that just made the noise louder.

I can see my kids playing and address issues without running up the stairs every 5 minutes. (For example: stop pushing your sister, I can see you! Haha) I also used it with the little girl I watch during the week who sometimes gets insecure during naptime. I can talk to her through the monitor and tell her it's ok, lie down and go to sleep. She settles right down! Great. :)-Multiple camera capability. You can display each camera's view on screen all at once or one at a time with just a push of a button. Very nice. If I hear a noise and think my child is waking up I just check on each one quickly then go on about my business. We previously only had a camera in my daughter's room, facing her crib.

It would allow a parent to work outside in the yard or at least leave the interior of the house for a short distance and still keep an eye on baby.

I had one of them speak into the monitor while I was far away up in their room standing in front of the camera and her voice was LOUD and CLEAR!  I've got the camera set about 12 feet from their bunk beds so I have a lot of the room itself in view.  Even from that far away the communication is very good.

I can hold the button down and tell my daughter to lay down and go to bed and after she looks around to find out where it came from, she lays down. I think this feature will be handy when she moves into her big girl bed and gets out of bed. I ordered two, so I have two cameras and two monitors. I figured that a whole 2nd set purchase versus the extra camera was worth it because there wasn't too much of a price difference (maybe $70 to purchase a whole other set), plus, if we ever broke one monitor we would have a back up, or, because my husband and I sleep in separate rooms, he could keep a monitor in his room of our 20 month old and I could keep a monitor in my room of our newborn. As soon as the monitors arrived I set them up...and they worked like a charm. They were SO easy to set up. I can't look at the same camera on both monitors, but that's fine. I can look at camera 1 on 1 monitor and camera 2 on the 2nd monitor, so I'm fine with that. And I can look at camera 1 and camera 2 on one monitor if the other monitor is turned off, so I have many options. I knew that when I removed the monitor from the base that it would stay on because it has a battery pack, but I was suprised to see that even when I unplugged the camera it stayed on. I could view myself on the monitor walking through the house with the camera. There is a terrible noise that is created when the monitor and camera are too close to each other, but it's not often that that would happen anyway. The night vision is great and the color during the day is great, too. I love the power save feature so the screen shuts off after 15 seconds (you can choose that it shuts off after a minute or doesn't shut off at all, too) so I don't have a blinding light during the night, and the sound stays on the whole time while the screen is off. There are 4 different sound levels, which is nice because I need it quieter because I wake up easier but my husband needs it louder so he will wake up to her making noise.

The red night vision light might wake a light-sleeping baby, but I haven't notice this with my baby.It doesn't take the best quality pictures, but the major use for this is NOT as a camera -- it's a baby monitor (which it does very well).This baby monitor would be perfect for first-time mothers.  Because of the video and night vision, it would especially helpful for mothers who have babies with health or breathing problems.  When my first baby was newborn, I would have to check her baby several times a night, just to make sure she was breathing.

Of course, now that I've had my third child, I'm not nearly as nervous as I was with the first one, but this sure would've saved me a lot of sleepless nights back then.", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "It's OK but snapshot freezes the whole device", "Author": "Mom of lotz", "ReviewID": "R2MB4WVTKP76VE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just received this today and after I looked through the manual and did the setup, I tested out the snapshot feature.

My children are my pets, in this case two cane corso dogs.  I know I know, they are kids to me and can often time get into or cause just as much trouble when left, alone and its a good way for me to monitor them and see what I have to do to better protect them and my home.The set up is pretty easy, although I rarely have a problem setting up anything, however in my opinion even the most technically challenged can do it.  The sound quality is good, consider I have excellent hearing and can pretty much hear most things going outside of my house let alone inside.  But since this is a two story house, and I am not always alert, its good to know if my dogs are messing around with trash or furniture ect.The quality of picture is not the best, but it definitely is manageable and great for taking quick shots of my dogs in action or just doing those things that make for great candid moments.  :-) There is the great two-way device feature so I can shout at the dogs NO! NO! or STOP! STOP!.Overall I am happy with the device and suits my needs just fine.  I am not a parent so I cannot say how it would work with an infant that depends so much on parents.  But it might help if your in another room u can watch your kid sleep, or make noises and even play with them verbally until you make it to the room.", "Date": "October 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great surveillance monitor, not just for babies!", "Author": "Koala1356", "ReviewID": "R33M15FVD365EW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had been looking around for an inexpensive, portable, in-home surveillance system to use for monitoring my elderly dog.  I had not actually thought of a 'baby' monitor, but I am pleasantly surprised to find this one, so much so that I intend to add another camera in the near future.The kit comes with one camera and power cable, and one monitor and charging cradle.  Both pieces have built-in rechargeable batteries that power their respective devices for about 5 hours.  I have my camera situated on a bookshelf facing my back door, and the monitor by my desk, where it sits charging in its cradle until I move to another room.  Since I have the camera in a 'permanent' position, it is plugged into a power outlet for all day use.  From my desk, I can now monitor my old dog and see when she is at the back door wanting to go out.  I can also see when she wants to come back in!  If I move to another room, I simply take the monitor with me.The hand held monitor is roughly the size as a small TV remote control (4.5\" x 2\" x 1.75\"), so if fits easily in your pocket for transporting from place to place.  Its wireless range is about 450 feet, depending on what the signal has to go through.  The monitor screen measures 2\" x 1.5\" (2.5\" diagonal) and is bright, colorful, and interference free, even when sitting next to my computer.  The refresh rate on the LCD screen is a little low, which means you will see jerky frames when something or someone moves in front of the camera, but it is sufficient enough for its purpose.  I wish the monitor had some sort of pull out/flip out stand support (like a photo frame does) so what I could stand it up for easy viewing when it is out of its cradle, like on my kitchen counter for example.  As it is, it is more convenient to keep it in its cradle in an upright viewing position.In nighttime conditions, the camera preforms superbly.  The 'sun' ring of IR lights the front of the camera throw enough distance to cover an entire room, making for easy viewing of your subject and surrounds (in night vision gray) even in pitch blackness.  However, make sure you are not pointing the camera at a reflective surface (such as a window or  shiny metal) or else all you will see is a big white blur.The controls on the front of the monitor are basic: MENU (to adjust brightness, power saving, vox, pair up an additional camera) POWER on/off, buttons labeled 1, 2, 3, 4 for switching between up to 4 cameras, and the circular center which you press UP to talk (your voice comes out of the speaker in the camera, and this can be a two way conversation), DOWN to take a snapshot.Unfortunately, the snapshot feature is the one downfall of this otherwise great kit.  The unit comes with a 128MB MicroSD card, but will accept a MicroSD card up to 2GB (sold separately).  Be aware that it only takes still images, not video, as the word \"recording\" may falsely suggest.  A MicroSD adapter is included in the box.  There is no other way to transfer your snapshots to your computer without pulling the MicroSD card out of the monitor, and using a card reader connected to your PC.  Getting the MicroSD card out of the monitor is extremely difficult, requiring a pointed object, a pair of tweezers, and a delicate hand!  If you are successful, however, you will likely be disappointed by the poor resolution (320 x 240) photo that awaits, which is also mirror imaged (backward) to your original subject.  In other words, don't bother with the snapshot feature.In conclusion, I think the Lorex LW2003 LIVE 'snap' Video Baby Monitor would be something parents would find perfect for monitoring their child (minus the snapshot feature) throughout the day and night.  I'd also recommend it to anyone considering a portable, wireless, in-home surveillance system that can support up to four cameras, including the monitoring of pets, or the elderly, or just any time you might need to have eyes in another room (or rooms).", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Compact, useful and fun!", "Author": "Chris Swanson \"I'm just this guy, you know?\"", "ReviewID": "R2973OMVJDHMVB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I don't have a baby, but I do love tech things!

Yes your home network will \"somewhat\" not interfere with this product (we do get a slight buzz in the audio from our home wifi network), HOWEVER this product will interfere with your wifi network making it not work at all. We have a 40Mbps connection, and have a wireless n/g router and when we turn the baby monitor handset on our download speeds drop to 100Kbps or less.

I don't see what Lorex says what frequency it operates on??Anyways, we bought this product before the baby came and so our return date has since past.

I have seen this brand, Lorex, at Costco for a home/property surveillance system, so they are in the business of surveillance, which I think is a plus.  This monitor is compact, but not too small, and lightweight.  Baby monitors have come a long way in 6-7 years!  I say BUY IT!", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "What a great product!", "Author": "L. Hartness \"LHartness\"", "ReviewID": "R2TZMT3NKZALXM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For 10 years I've been using audio-only monitors for my children.  They've been very helpful in attending to their needs during times when they've been in bed and need help.  This is my first experience with a video monitor, and I'm very impressed!The first thing I liked about the product was its ease in setting it up.  After getting all the parts out of the box, the user guides, etc. I unfolded the Quick Start Guide.  This gave me an easy to follow, 6-step process to get up and running fast. Note:  Although it works right out of the box, be sure to charge up the product for 6 hours before using it.I then pulled out the 30-page User's Guide to get the full rundown on how to use the monitor. It was easy to understand, without alot of high-handed technical jargon.  I also liked that it was in only one language, so that I wasn't stuck with an overly thick Guide with multiple languages.The system itself feels sturdy and high-quality.  I have every reason to believe that this will be in use for years to come, even after my child doesn't have a monitor in his room anymore & we're using it for some other monitoring purpose.  I love the fact that the system is completely portable and wireless after proper charging. This will be so convenient for us when we take out of town trips.The snapshot camera worked just fine for me-- I was able to take photos, easily remove the tiny memory chip, insert it into the enclosed converter cartridge, and then place it in my netbook computer's memory card slot.  The photos were easy to retrieve off the memory card from that point.  The converter cartridge even has a \"lock\" function so that the files cannot be deleted off the memory chip.  Very handy if you have some precious photos that you don't want to lose.The commands and menu system on the handset of the monitor aren't too difficult to understand.  It might take a few times of practice to be comfortable in finding and implementing what I need, but overall it's pretty intuitive.I think my only quibble with the product is the manner in which the handset is plugged into its charging cradle. Because the outlet for charging is relatively small, you have to make sure the handset is lined up *just right* when you're plugging it in.  I wish the docking of the monitor was more smooth.Overall, this is a great product.  I hope that my slumbering youngest son isn't in distress too often, but if he is, this product will be much more informative and useful than my simple audio monitor.  Interestingly enough, if you want this product to be in Audio Mode only, you can go back to that way as well.  Lorex has produced a very versatile, useful and high-quality product.  It definitely receives my recommendation.", "Date": "September 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "GREAT product that mom's going to LOVE", "Author": "Grand Plumper", "ReviewID": "R3MPT0CXJP9V03", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a GREAT little gift item for the new moms out there - a wireless audio and video \"system\" to watch & monitor baby. Video camera is tiny & very light, easily mountable on a wall or simply set on a nearby shelf. System has a cool infrared feature so baby may be seen sleeping away in the dark without being disturbed (no bright light shining on their little faces). One can program the system to \"wake up\" from stand-by mode when baby moves or makes noises, to preserve battery life. Their is even an internal camera, with memory card, that can take pictures when baby does something remarkably \"cute\" when nobodys looking!

Then I took the camera near the receiver and it reacquired the signal.  Not a moment later it lost it again.  I was 10 feet away and it couldn't keep the signal.Throughout the course of troubleshooting what could be wrong, I came to find that the battery does not last that long and I had to recharge it.When I called to discuss this issue with customer service, they told me that the signal should go through at least one wall.  But if my wall is too thick it may not.  The representative informed me that I MAY have a faulty unit (vice a crappy product).  He told me he would send a new one out.  3 weeks later, no replacement.  I call another rep, and they say \"did you fax us your original receipt?\"  Of course the first idiot never informed me that I needed to send in my receipt.So in the end, I'm left balancing newborn twins while waiting for over 30 minutes with customer service only to find out that not only are their products horrible, but their (outsourced) customer service reps are no better.Product returned.", "Date": "February 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Simply Great Baby Monitor!", "Author": "Linda Painchaud-Steinman \"PARK EDGE BOOKS\"", "ReviewID": "R3PL4VCP39O4ML", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The simplicity of setup and use for the Lorex video baby monitor made it a five-star pick for me.
