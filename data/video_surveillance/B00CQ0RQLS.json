{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Lowest quality of workmanship", "Author": "Syed M.", "ReviewID": "R247AV0ETV0DVO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Please don't make the same mistake as I did. Do not buy this product. This company designed a product which shouldn't be out in the market, instead it should go through many many many more phases of redesigning and engineering, definitely more testing. The camera comes with a cheap wall mount, which can easily snap and drop the camera.  The NVR system itself is the worst made product out there. And one note to the  developers that worked on their softwares \"You should be fired\".Cons:Product is not designed for usability. The NVR system, doesn't have an HDMI output. Three out of four POE ports in the back stop functioning after 2 weeks. Playback video software is designed horribly. No software for Mac users, must have windows and top of that only Internet Explorer is the only browser that will allow local or remote viewing. Using the PC software, you cannot rewind, fast forward, or slow video recordings. Navigating through recorded video is a nightmare.Pros:Price is cheap, and affordable. Thats it!!!", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "dont waste your money!!!", "Author": "Brent", "ReviewID": "R2OFG1FEENH9S8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Had this for 6 months.  been out of service 3 times already.  more time at Zomdo repair than working. repair shop receives DVR, then sends back unrepaired-- more time lost.  Have a friend at work that bought the same item.  His has failed 3 times already also. Lost dvr twice, lost all cameras once- so far.  They apparently have no quality control other than the public testing the units for them.  Just talked to Zmodo, they may have to issue credit, as replacements may be out of stock--My lucky day!!
