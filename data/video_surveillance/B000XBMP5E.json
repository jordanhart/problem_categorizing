The sensor that triggers the red light is very good & picks things up from quite a distance.I made it look even more real, by taking the wires out of an old broken (battery operated) toy that my Son had and glueing them under the batteries in the dummy camera where there was a little hole going into the device.  I used rubber cement (like E6000 that you can find in any sewing department).  I then made a little notch in the battery door and strung the wires out of the camera through there.  I drilled my pilot holes for the screws that the bracket attaches to. I then drilled another small hole in the ceiling next to the pilot holes and under where the bracket for the camera would go.  I put glue on the end of the wires and threaded them into that hole.  I then installed the camera and bracket over that hole I drilled.This way if someone ever pulls the camera out of the ceiling to see if it's real, they will be pretty sure their photo was taken when they realize they just ripped a bunch of wires out of the ceiling - that were attached to the camera.", "Date": "December 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Oh boy do I have a review you will all like.", "Author": "Secret Agent Man", "ReviewID": "R3KL931DTKWL36", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I live in the mountains. Have a female neighbor that vandalized my property. My place is worth close to a million bucks. I built an 8 foot tall solid wooden fence between our properties, 200 feet long. I wanted to keep her and her white trash boyfriend away from my fence and property. I put three of these camera's on her side of my fence that is 4 feet on my side of the property line. This was in June of 2011. I also put up some old non working sensor lights and made it look like they were wired up to 12/2 wire. She complained to Sheriff that I was spying on her. He came out to my place and told me I needed to take them down. He looked right at them from like 2 feet away. I told him NO WAY, that I had a right to protect my property from a vandal of which he refused to press charges against for the vandalism because she works for the County Attorney's Office. (yes favoritism). Keep in mind my wife is a retired Deputy from another county and one of my children is a Sheriff's Deputy from a different department also. Long story short here. Sheriff had 3 deputies come out and look at my camera's and take photo's of them. Threatened me with a \"felony stalking charge\". I told him give it his best shot. He called in State Bureau of Investigation agents to investigate. They came out there on at least three different occasions taking photo's of these three fake camera's. I was laughing my butt off. This went on all summer. The Bureau agent wanted to talk to me after 5 months of investigation. I agreed because I wanted to talk to them. It was an hour and a half of interrogation and he was really biased toward the neighbor. I recorded the entire conversation unknown to the moron. It is legal in my state. He told me he was turning it over to the District Attorney for Prosecution. I said, good luck. In my state there are no laws against surveillance camera's outside and especially on your own property. I then hired a Defense Attorney in order to make sure lies from the Sheriff and Agents and Nieghbor, didn't get me charged. It has been in the hands of the DA now for over a month and I have heard nothing about any charges being filed. I have broken no laws. I have a feeling that two agents, the Sheriff and 3 of his deputies, and the neighbor have major egg on their faces because when I was interrogated I finally fessed up that the camera's are all fake. I even showed one to the idiot agent and boy did he get mad. Ha ha.......So, if you are wondering if these camera's look real enough for you, rest assured that they can fool anyone and they are a great deterrent to crime.

The exception is that the motion sensor has a range of 1-2 feet.  Not one of the four I bought had a range of more than that.

Even when I stand right in front of it and wave my hands, the sensor won't catch it.It's hard to complain for the price, and coupled with fully functioning video cameras and security system, it serves its purpose.

Black base has 4-1/2 inch diameter, total base/dome height is 3 inches.  All-plastic construction, with small simulated camera lens and nearby red-flashing 'activation' LED.  Black inner dome, shields back of 'camera' from view.  Aim is fixed at about a 45 degree angle, so need to point in the general direction when hanging.  Base has 2 opposing screw-slots to mount on wall/ceiling with a slight twist, so proper aiming takes a bit of planning (2 screws and optional plastic-anchors are included).Unlike the description photo, my red LED is located on the base-side of the camera lens (instead of top-of-dome side as pictured).  Dome is spring-loaded and can be pushed slightly into base.  The product box mentions an ON/OFF switch here, but no switch exists.  The motion-sensor mentioned behind the camera lens, also does not exist.  When 2 AA batteries are installed, the red LED flashes steadily at a rate of about 1 second ON, 1 second OFF.  Removing the base-plate shows 2-wires going from the battery compartment to the flashing LED, that's it for internal circuitry.For the $4 price, I think it has a good appearance.  The flashing light gives added realism in a lit area, while drawing attention in a dark area.  With 24/7 flashing, I'll have to see how long a pair of batteries lasts before deciding whether this feature is actually worth using.

Yes... it looks like a real camera if mounted more than 3-6 feet above field of vision but the ablity to get the flashing light to work will drive you maddddddd!  I suspect this product will NOT do well in any exterior install so keep to interior conditions. Worth the few $'s for cost but do not plan on the flashing light to work pass the first battery change in 90 days +or-.", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "3 different packages but they are all good", "Author": "markbirn", "ReviewID": "R1QUHFC2A4F0FR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered 3 and they seem to come from 3 different companies, the screws and plastic screw holders that go into the wall were a little different from each other, but I got them all up with no problem and they seem to look real.

Based on this product's description, it is a fairly decent 'imitation' security camera which looks strikingly like actual cameras of its design (I have a couple which are real, and they look pretty much exactly like this).Something some folks might consider: A lot of the domed security cameras, the real ones, don't use flashing lights. Not sure why a flashing light would make something look more realistic. Aside from that detail, the product itself does look very much like a real camera.* MOTION DETECTION? No.. No idea why folks thought that!:Perhaps the product description/design has changed from some of the older reviews, because some folks mention a \"motion detector feature\" which this product clearly does *not* have. If you disassemble it, you will see it has a switch, a battery holder, and a flashing LED. That's it. To turn the product on or off, you press down on the outer black rim of the dome and the switch clicks, and the light flashes or shuts off. I have seen other ones for more money with this feature, but this product doesn't have it listed in the description.* OPERATION:You pop batteries in. You press the outer black rim down until the switch clicks, either off or on. The LED will blink when it's on.* OVERALL:I give it a 4 because it meets the description of the product precisely, and it's functional. I can't give it a 5 because there's some gentle scuffs on the dome which annoy me. It's not that the product isn't new, it's just stuff that happens at the factories where they make the cheap plastic dome.", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "terrible product", "Author": "Lawrence M.

Patten, the listing is a bit deceptive, although I don't know if this is intentional, or merely sloppiness.And while it is true that the pricing is a bit of a clue, I saw low quality dummy cameras for a buck a piece a while back in one of the electronics surplus catalogs, so it isn't completely out of the question.When you think about it, it is a small, lightweight piece of plastic, and a blinking led (the blink circuitry is on the led's die).  There are kid's toys out there that come packed in a piece of plastic with a blinking led as an attention getter - and that's the part you throw away!  I see no reason a low grade \"least cost\" unit couldn't go for this price, although I agree it would normally be sold for a little more.  In any case, there are better looking units for sale here than this one, although they do cost slightly more.Note to J. Serdynski:  If you read so well, why did you misspell K. Patten's last name? (twice!)  And why are you so angry at the world that you savaged this person twice, once in your review, and again in a comment under their review?
