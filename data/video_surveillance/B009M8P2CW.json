I mention this in the video portion of the review, but ALL infrared night vision baby camera have poor resolution in the dark. They just do... I have tried four separate cameras and none of them offer a clear picture in the dark. They are all fuzzy and it is difficult to distinguish any level of detail. Another observation.... it seems like the bigger the display the WORSE the picture becomes when using night vision. I guess the resolution of the cameras are all about the same, but when you blow it up to a bigger screen, you lose additional detail. Soooo.... the Samsung SEW-3036NW baby monitor really does not have great picture when you are using it in the dark. The good news? It really doesn't matter too much.Why doesn't it matter? When we are using the camera at night we are trying to see a few basics, is our daughter still in bed, is she sitting up, and other big types of things. What are not trying to do is distinguish if she is smiling or has something in her hand. The Samsun SEW-3036WN works well enough for the big things, but like all baby monitors, it will struggle to pull out the details (although they all will distinguish between *open* and *closed* eyes.Notes--The Samsung SEW-3036WN will allow you to talk to you child through the camera. This is more important that it may seem - it is always nice to be able to ask \"What is the matter\"- The range on the camera seems more than accurate - 800' seems a little over-generous, but it certainly has enough range for our home.- The daytime camera resolution is very good- The camera has the ability to zoom and pan - although zooming in at night lessens the already poor resolution- The camera can be mounted to the wall, but it does not come with a mounting clip (like the Levanas)- Can support up to 4 camera from one monitor/display- Has a built in clock- Has the ability to be used with voice activated controls - but we have found that just leaving the camera on seems to work better for us.- Very large 3.5\" screen - although it does cost use some picture clarity/resolution- The display is fully rechargeable - The battery life seems to be in the 6-8 hour rangeFinal Verdict - The Samsung SEW-3036NW is a very nice baby monitor, but like all infrared baby monitors, it does have its limitations in low light situations.4 1/2 Stars", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Great Brand New Video Monitor From Samsung - Detailed Review", "Author": "Dan", "ReviewID": "R4KD5C7EIDBPE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I consider myself pretty tech savvy and I enjoy my electronics. So in anticipation for my son's birth in November, I started an intensive research on various video monitors. There're a lot of choices out there but I stumbled on Samsung video monitors.At a first glance, I think Samsung has the best look and design out of all the video monitors out there; simple and attractive. I love the big screen and simple design. There's nothing to figure out, everything is simple. You play around with it for about 5 minutes and you know what you have. I've seen a lot of various monitors and most of them are cheap looking or bulky... or they're way too complicated.The Samsung brand also sold me. I love their TVs and I love their phones... I figure they'd do a great job for their baby monitor as well.Out of all of Samsung's monitors, I zeroed in on the SEW-3036. I bought it to test it out and get used it...to make sure it's going to be a dependable monitor for our son. Our first child, so you can get pretty obsessive.I was impressed with the video and sound. Video, both day and night time, is the best I've seen. Sound is clear and their two way talk button is a very convenience feature. I can imagine using it to talk to my baby as well as my wife...  The audio on this camera is very stable. Usually when a microphone and speaker is involved...there is a lot of feedback. This monitor, as long as you don't have the monitor volume at the highest, the feedback is almost non-existent.The battery life on this monitor is also very impressive. I tested and fiddled with it all day long and the parent unit just kept on going. The parent unit comes with something called the `Vox'. It's pretty useful. If your monitor doesn't detect sound for a minute, it'll go to sleep. If it hears something, it comes back on. It makes the battery life last even longer.A list of its other features, it has a zoom button with a pretty clear 2x zoom but I found myself not using it much. But it's nice that it's there if you need it.  It has a scan mode that I might use if I had more cameras. You can connect up to four...I don't know if I'll need that many, but that's pretty good. I guess you can put the cameras in multiple rooms; something I think I'll need when my kid gets bigger and starts walking.Overall, it's a great system. The price isn't bad. I found more expensive comparable units or inferior units more expensive. Samsung has made the right choice. They brought down the price and focused on the most important features to make the SEW-3036 a very solid monitor. I've played around with it for a couple of days now and I really think it's going to make things  a lot easier for me and my wife.  A very excited soon-to-be dad here writing what I found! I'll update the review after I try it out with my baby!!!! But so far, I am very very impressed!", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Night Vision blinks out every 3 seconds.", "Author": "Carina", "ReviewID": "RGFXK1QPVEM0Q", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Very disappointed in this baby monitor. I love the samsung brand. I have a Samsung galaxy phone and tablet and really enjoy them, but this baby monitor does not compare at all. For six months I have been using the Levana 32102 Era Advanced, it is much cheaper than this monitor and has a smaller screen but I must say I think I like that one much better than this samsung one.First, whenever you turn on this baby monitor it plays a little tune. Which isn't good in my house because usually I am using the baby monitor when my baby is sleeping and this tune is loud enough to wake him from another room. Plus I am in the habit of turning on the monitor before I leave the room and I have woke him a couple times because of the tune this monitor plays when it boots up. Very annoying.Then, I usually use this in the mornings when I am getting ready for work and it is still dark so I use the night vision a lot. But the night vision on this monitor blacks out every 3 seconds, then shows the feed for 3 seconds then blacks out for another 3 seconds the entire time it is on! It is frustrating. What is happening it is goes from night vision to regular mode every 3 seconds! And because the room is dark I only see a black screen. During the day when I use it, it also cycle through from night vision to regular mode every 3 seconds, it is so annoying!Also, the quality of the video is horrible. It is not crisp at all. It is blurry and the color is horrible. The color on the screen looks blurry in night vision an fuzzy in regular. One time I couldn't even figure out how my baby was positioned because the quality is so horrible. The Levana 32102 Era Advanced screen is smaller but the quality is much more crisper and I can see my baby breath and everything from that screen. I love the size of the samsung baby monitor screen but what good does it do when the video is blurry, bad quality and bad color? Plus, it blinks in and out every three seconds from night vision to regular so it frustrates me even more!The camera can sit on flat surface or hang on the wall and it comes with two screws if you want to go with the latter option. I hung my on the wall and the camera does move very well so you can get it to the right angle to see your baby in the crib. It moves up, down, side to side, back and forth. So, one of the pluses is the camera has good angles that you can have it anywhere and position the camera.There is a sleep button on the monitor so you can turn off the video and hear only. There is also a VOX option which blinked off and on from night vision to regular as well every 3 seconds.Overall I am disappointed with the blinking off and on every 3 seconds. It is harder to focus on what is going on when it constantly goes to from night vision to regular mode. It doesn't matter what the lighting is in the room it does it no matter what making me not want to use this monitor. Guess I will stick to my cheaper Levana 32102 Era Advanced.**********Update 5/15/2013********************I updated my review based what another customer told me. He told me that to stop it from going from night vision to regular vision is to put black tape over the sensor found below the power on/off switch. I put some black duct tape over it and now when it is dark in my baby's room it no longer cycles through every 3 seconds from night vision to regular. HOWEVER, it still goes back and forth when there is light in the room during the day. But, it isn't as noticeable, just a bit of a color change every 3 seconds. I can deal with that, I hated it when it would go completely black when it went out of night vision in the dark. And this fixes that. But still it has the annoying tune when turning it on, so it really only goes up a half a star for me because of that and it still blinks in and out during the day too.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent video monitor for the price!", "Author": "Kate", "ReviewID": "R3OQ3569CZG2EC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a new born baby and searched a video baby monitor.There were many baby monitor on sale and I started compare them with my needs.I chose three baby monitors, Motorola MBP36, Infant Optics DXR-5, and Samsung sew-3036wn.First of all, I removed infant optics because I thought video screen should be big enough.Motorola and Samsung have 3.5 inch screen.  I compared Motorola and Samsung functions in detail. It came down to the Pan and tilt function vs a $60 discount. I selected $60 discount. I thought I will just put my baby in the crib, so I won't need pan and tilt function that much.Furthermore, Samsung model has sound wake up function which is called VOX, and it looks very cool to me.When I get Samsung baby monitor on hand, the first feeling is that the design looks cool. It has very simple and great design. The video display was not excellent t but clear enough. The night vision was fine. The battery life was even longer than written in manual. With continuous video display, it goes about 4 hours and with auto sleep mode, it goes over 6 hours! The sound is super clear. My baby sleeps on the second floor and I put the baby monitor on my kitchen desk. I realized just how great the sound was on this monitor as I was climbing upstairs. Hearing both my baby upstairs and the sound from the monitor downstairs, I couldn't tell them apart. It sounded like I was listening to my baby surround sound.The most satisfied function is VOX! It's so cool function and works very well. When I turn this function on, the video display automatically turns off when my baby makes no sounds, and the video turn on immediately when it detects sound. . It gives me a signal with sound when my baby makes noise so I don't have to pay attention to baby monitor when my baby is sleeping. There is no constant background noise as well. I love this function.I love this monitor and now looking for an additional camera for my baby play yard use.", "Date": "October 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not Very Impressive", "Author": "Sherry Barr", "ReviewID": "R2ZEIG43FNTBY3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm surprised to see so many positive reviews for this monitor.  I've waited to write a review until I had the opportunity to use this product for several weeks.  My only other experience with a baby monitor is a Summer monitor which I'ved used for hours each day and throughout the night for the past almost 3 years (I actually have two of them, which I love). However, the Samsung pales in comparison and it seems considerably overpriced.There are several features of the Samsung monitor that I find problematic:1) The resolution is poor. While one is typically using the monitor to make sure his/her child is still in bed or out of harm's way, so seeing in detail with great resolution isn't really a necessity, I was still surprised at how poor the resolution is - it does have a larger than average screen, but I don't see the point of a large screen with poor resolution.  A smaller screen with better resolution seems to make a lot more sense to me.2) The battery life is terrible.  The system comes with a power cord and most of the time it needs to be used while plugged in.  It's also possible to use it in \"sleep mode\" which means less battery power is used, but you can't see your child unless there's noise detected by the camera. I prefer to keep the picture view on while I'm using it as my child sometimes gets up and gets out of bed without making a sound. When the battery does get low, there is a battery low indicator to let you know, but it's typcially only a minute or two until the monitor dies completely and it must be plugged in.3) You want to make sure you don't forget to check that the camera is in view of your baby/child before he/she falls asleep because the monitor makes an obnoxious sound when powered on - one that would likely wake up anyone else sleeping in the room, especially your baby.4) It's very easy to touch the wrong button on the monitor which then means that the camera and monitor must be \"paired\" again - this means walking into your child's room to touch a button on the camera to make this happen.  This is not good at all if it happens when your child who doesn't sleep well to begin with is finally fast asleep5) The cord on the camera is very short, which reduces your options for where you can place the camera in relation to an outlet.  Mounting the camera in the corner of a room is not an option.6) The menu/navigation seems primitive - it feels like my first computer (in terms of functinality, this is irrelevant, but given the price point, I expected something a bit more advanced.The only real positive features I can see are that it has the capacity to integrate multiple cameras and it has a \"talk\" feature where you can talk to your child.Overall, I was very disappointed by this baby monitor.", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "I actually bought this product and use it...", "Author": "CK", "ReviewID": "R397BZFUBXJQWA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In summary this is a nice monitor, not without it's issues but still good.  I had a summer infant monitor and it broke on me. This monitor will be its replacement.Pros--big screen-video quality is decent in both light and dark situations.  It's not hd but you can see clearly.-easy to navigate, with volume control on the unit as buttons-able to use video without sound or sound without video-time is displayed on monitor-light weight-2 way talk feature-easy to switch between multiple cameras (I don't have multiple cameras, but the button to change cameras is prominent on the unit)-sound is fine. Again not hd, but do you really want to hear your kid cry in hd?!-vox feature works well and saves you from having to press a button to see what's happening with your child-has some pan and zoom-no issues with range in my 3000 sq ft home-no issues with interference with my wifi or other the neighbor's monitorsCons--battery life isn't great. Doesn't work more than 1 night without a charge.-Doesn't stand up on its own without using the kick stand-kick stand is a bit flimsy and not easy to pull out-pan and zoom aren't great, but I'm still glad to have them even as limited as they are-speaker is in the back of the monitor. This makes it hard to hear at low volume settings.-when turned from the off to the on position, the monitor plays a Samsung tune. It is annoying especially if your partner is sleeping.

The Summer Infant unit worked flawlessly for the last two years and just died suddenly at the rental house (looks like the wiring was from the early 1900s). After this, I'm going to be buying a replacement camera as the handheld unit works just fine.Now, back to the SEW-3036WN.Let's get started with the Pros:-2x digital zoom (Summer Infant model didn't have this feature)-decent night vision (Summer Infant was tied here)-large screen 3.5 in. (Larger than the Summer Infant Model)-decent resolution (Better than the Summer Infant Model)-easy user interface (More features than the Summer Infant Model, but can be confusing if you don't use all the features)-simple pairing procedure once you read the manual (Summer Infant's pairing was easier. You just press the button on the back of the camera.)-2-way talk feature(Not that you'll ever use this but to mess with your child. My wife hates when I do this.)Cons:-Loses signal often even at 40 ft from the camera. (To be fair, the Summer Infant also lost signal at this range, but didn't beep. Re-acquired signal easily) We run at least 2 Netflix streams on WiFi @ 2.4GHz. Adding the Samsung to the household now makes some of the computers have to reset their wireless adapters (Disable/Enable in Windows, reboot the PS3) I know you're going to tell me to switch the wireless over to the 5GHz band, but not all computers have WiFi adapters that use the 5GHz band. My Astro A50s use this band already with no issues. Turning off the camera and base removed interference for my WiFi (tested in 2 houses).-Beeps every time it loses connection. This was tested in the vacation house at my sister's wedding, as well as our own home. Unreliable even if close to the camera/transmitter. (The Summer Infant Model doesn't beep. It just shows a small error message and then reconnects.)-Sound is not very clear in comparison to the Summer Infant model.Overall:If you don't have any 2.4GHz devices in the home, and you don't live in a community that uses any other 2.4GHz devices, you should be good with this unit. Test range. Your mileage may vary.If you happen to live in a neighborhood with large amounts of interference from overlapping WiFi networks, Bluetooth, or anything that operates on the 2.4GHz bands, I wouldn't recommend this unit.I'm writing to with two purposes here. One, to help others make informed decisions. And two, to try to get Samsung to make a better Baby Monitor. I'm a big Samsung fan. I've used lots of devices, from their MP3 players to HDTVs and I adore the quality of the brand. And I do say this with all the civility I can muster, \"This product is not as good as similar priced models from Summer Infant.\" No I'm not a Summer Infant salesman or shill, but an owner.

Finkel \"Jack of Trades\"", "ReviewID": "R33NJ8IZM9YRHA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Samsung SEW-3036WN is my third baby monitor.  I have previously used Summer Infant Best View Handheld Color Video Monitor, Sliver/White and Motorola MBP33 Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 2.8 Inch.  The Samsung SEW-3036WN falls somewhere in the middle, but does have some strong points and weak points relative to the other monitors.The best selling points of the Samsung monitor are its modern, streamlined appearance and slim camera.  The 'Vox' setting, which conserves battery life by going into sleep mode after a short period of silence is a great idea, but isn't sensitive enough for me.  In order to wake up the monitor, I need to snap my fingers quite loudly from a few feet away.  I prefer hearing when my child is awake even when they are not screaming or making a commotion.  I think other parents may like the Vox mode though and it does work as promised.  It may help lighter sleeping parents avoid waking up needlessly at night.  The screen is decent at 3.5 inches but the resolution is only 320x240, so you certainly won't see the promised 640x480 resolution from the camera.  Also, the colors on the screen are extremely washed out even in moderate lighting.The biggest weakness of this monitor is that you cannot control the direction of the camera remotely.  Most monitors, certainly in this price range, have this function.  I also found that with only 1 wall, the range was under 100 ft.  This falls well short of the promised 800 ft. range.  I had trouble using the monitor initially.  It took many tries to get it to stay connected to the camera.  I hope this problem does not continue.  Also I like having a temperature gauge on the monitor (even if they are usually off by a few degrees) and I found the startup sound quite annoying.Overall, I found this Samsung baby monitor to present an adequate picture, with acceptable audio and video noise.  The monitor looks great, but lacks important functions that are commonly found in monitors at this price range.

It works great, but I encountered some quirks. First, if you leave a t.v on in the room the camera will get confused and switch back and forth from night to day settings, making it very hard to see. When we finally mounted the camera we made sure to put it where the light from the t.v wouldn't catch it. It was over a week before we mounted it, we didn't want to; we wanted an up close view because we like to see her breathing. So, our only option was to attempt to prop it up with a pillow, since it is only designed for a wall mount. When we gave in and mounted it, the only wall we could put it on to avoid light from the t.v was further than we wanted, but still serves its purpose since I can see her when she wakes up.

So we've used the Summer Slim and Something-or-other baby video monitor for about 2.5 years.  We've replaced it three times (using an extended warranty that was $30 for 15 months).  We spent probably $300+ in equipment and replacements and warranties on that machine.  When it broke last week I was done with it.  I found this at a good price (under $200) and I know the quality of Samsung so I bought it.  The look, feel, and quality of this camera so far outshines the Summer product that there's no way I'd ever go back.  The monitor feels almost like a Gameboy or something close to it.  The little things like time display, signal strength, and appearance on the monitor make this device so much better.  The zoom is a neat tool but not useful for us now, and I love the two-way voice communication just because I can surprise my daughter with it.  Seriously - if you've suffered with the absence of quality baby video monitors like we have, and have been forced to get the Summer products with extended warranties from places like Babies R Us - don't do it any longer!

The first thing I noticed is the attractive design.  It is simple and sleek. It is also very user friendly. It comes with a manual, but it is very easy to figure out how to use it on your own.The Samsung SEW-3036 is just the right size. It is sturdy without being bulky. It is lightweight and really easy to carry around. It is small enough to fit in my pocket, but not too small. The screen is 3.5 inches. You can zoom in up to 2x. I don't need to use the zoom very often as I found the screen to be the perfect size, but it's a nice feature to have. The night vision was really clear as well. I was surprised at how well I could see all the baby's movements in the dark.The picture quality is excellent at any zoom. The video and sound are very clear, too.  I didn't experience any feedback or static at all. You can hook the monitor up to a total of four cameras. The cameras are extremely easy to set up. It only takes a few seconds to hook up one of the cameras. This really makes things easier for me. I don't have to worry about making sure the baby monitor is in the same room as my baby. I just set the cameras up and carry one thing with me. It really sets my mind at ease to be able to see what's happening as well.This is a huge improvement over the audio monitors I'm used to. The audio monitors let you hear what's happening in the baby's room, but they don't let you do anything about it. The Samsung SEW-3036 has a two way talk feature so you can talk to your baby, too.The best feature is the Voice Activated Mode (VOX). If you turn it on, the video monitor turns off if your baby is not making any noise and automatically turns back on when your baby starts making sounds. This is extremely convenient and really helps the battery life.The battery life is excellent. The battery lasts about 4 hours with continuous display and about 6 hours with sleep mode (VOX). I was also impressed with the range of this monitor. It has a great range. It beeps when you are out of range, but that doesn't happen to me very often.Overall, I am very impressed. The Samsung SEW-3036 is well worth the price. It is high tech, but still easy to use. There are enough features to customize it, but not so many that you get overwhelmed.

Then it started unpairing from the camera regularly - a pain in the neck because you have to go back into the baby's room to re-pair it with the camera.  Again, I liked the device enough to overlook this.  Finally, last night it just stopped transmitting sound altogether.

Previously, we only had a basic model from IKEA and were a little envious of our relatives high end models. We were getting a little kick out of the fact that we would be the only ones in our family with a color monitor. Unfortunately, we fell victim to a defect in the SEW-3036WN that is common to the model: the light sensor causes the camera to switch between day and night mode constantly so that you cannot actually see your baby. The result is that the IKEA monitor we paid less than 10 bucks for is more practical.This problem is commonplace in reviewer forums. Our attempts to get a replacement were unsuccessful. We were instructed by Samsung support to do a factory reset, which we did. It solved nothing for us or other reviewers. We were told to mail it to Samsung for repair, but had to go through a separate week-long process to determine if we qualified. We didn't because, as a Vine reviewer, I don't have a receipt. Had we qualified and sent a receipt, then Samsung would have sent a shipping label approximately a week later, according to their rep. Afterwards, we would've gotten a replacement a week or two after that. I'm very glad we weren't relying on this thing for our twins due in a few weeks. Since I never got a replacement, I can only review the product I have, which does not work.Having used other monitors at my relatives' homes, I can tell you that this model would not have gotten 5 stars from me, even if it had worked, because it lacks features common to similarly priced monitors and exchanges them for features that are less useful. For example, there is no ability to move the camera remotely or even to zoom into a particular spot digitally. Also, the monitor only has 3 or 4 hours of battery time and does not come with a stand charger. The cameras must be plugged in and come with a fairly short cord. The cameras also lack a clip and so cannot be attached to a crib or Pack-N-Play directly. Additional cameras are very expensive (approx. 125 dollars each). In light of these issues, having a color monitor really doesn't provide much practical benefit.For the price, you can do better than this baby monitor, assuming it works, and there are strong odds that it will not.

It kept losing sound and the video kept degenerating and going black. The company contacted me and sent me a replacement with an upgrade to the next model. I'm happy with the customer service.So I still think the voice activated system is too sensitive even on the lowest sensitivity setting, after a while it just picks up every tiny sound. The screen scratches super easily, so buy a screen guard like for a cell phone. The reason I chose this one is because motorola doesn't have VOX mode. I think VOX setting is crucial since no one wants to hear every whimper or sound machine in their baby room while they're trying to sleep. So even if you can turn the video part off on other machines, the sound is still heard. Since I have a sound machine in her room, that irritated me. VOX mode saves your baby from constant EMF radiation too. The camera only broadcasts the waves when it's activated by crying. I highly recommend it. On the other hand, this one doesn't have a temp reading. No idea why, since it's a great camera overall and their newest model. How hard is it to put a temp reading in it? But I think that's less important than VOX mode. The other thing that's a bit irritating is that a lot of features you have to go through the menu to get to, like zooming in on the baby. I also thing that they should have made the buttons light up so it's easier to navigate in the middle of the night. But that's asking for too much, right?

Excellent night vision.But it gets confused and starts blinking in every 3 seconds.Goes dark... 3 seconds... image... 3 seconds... goes dark again... 3 seconds.

A round sensor (round glass).Doing that the camera became very stable.That sensor I read that sends accurate information for the infrared itself.

When we got it, I tested its functionality.Several things stood out to me that I disliked from the beginning. When you turn the monitor on, a very loud melody plays with the Samsung logo on the screen. In my opinion, neither is needed. I can see the brand right on the plastic. The tone is loud enough to be on par with \"passionate discussion\" between two people, more than loud enough to disturb a sleeping baby. You better have the monitor already turned on or turn it on a few rooms away from the baby to keep the child asleep.Also, the lens on the camera doesn't allow a very wide field of view. If you want the whole crib in the picture, you will need to get fairly far away from it. Compound that with the very short power cable for the camera, and you are left with few if any options for camera placement in the room. We ended up going off of the front corner of the crib to a side wall six feet away. We got the entire crib in the picture at an awkward angle in the viewer, but it's manageable. The icing on this paragraph's criticisms is that the picture quality is bad for what you are paying. Jump ahead to after my child's birth and I cannot tell if her eyes are opened or closed despite looking right at them. I think I should be able to tell.With all of that said, I would have been okay with this product. However, when my child was born this winter, we got hit with the blinking night-vision defect out of nowhere. If you read other negative reviews, you already know about it. Essentially, the camera blinks from normal vision to night vision every three seconds when it should be in night vision all of the time because the room is dark: Dark -> Night Vision -> Dark -> Night Vision, over and over. Thinking that maybe the light sensor was picking something from the IR light, I did an experiment. In a dark room, I put four layers of DUCT TAPE on the sensor with no change. I then took a black shirt and wrapped the camera up in it, still blinks. My conclusions were that it once worked, broke, and now can no longer operate in a useful way in a dark room.With this glitch, I went to the internet to see what's up. Looking at other reviews, I see it's a common problem. I also do not see a public response from Samsung to my satisfaction. In a twist of irony, my wanting to be a good parent meant that I bought it months before, so refunds aren't possible now. As it stands, my time is more valuable than the money this thing costs, so we are keeping it with a workaround: door open and hallway light on. I don't plan on pursuing technical support because I am busy and we actually do need to use it, even in its limited state. However, I do hope to help others. Don't be fooled! This unit is crap. My opinion of Samsung has plummeted. I won't buy ANY of their products again.Finally, just to prove I am not a shill, I have no alternative products to offer in this review. All of these video monitors look like potential rip-offs to me. The only help I can provide is to say that THIS product is DEFINITELY a rip-off. Don't believe the positive reviews if you ever intend on using the night-vision feature.", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's only been 1 day....UPDATED4/12/13", "Author": "JPD27", "ReviewID": "R1532H4LUU4647", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this monitor today at a local retailer.  I know it's rather premature for a real world review, but this monitor is soooooooo much better than our older monitor (http://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Digital-Video-Monitor-Screen/dp/B004VL2VS8/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid;=1360356505&sr;=8-8&keywords;=motorola+baby+monitors)That said, your experience may vary depending on what you currently have or have had in the past.  This Samsung  monitor offers better night vision ability, a wider field of vision from the included camera, and a much larger screen than our previous unit.  Everything is a vast improvement over the Motorola we have.  For some reason beyond on all logic they are priced the same on amazon... While the Motorola can be found for less on some sites, I have yet to see a price that is comparable to its value.  Ok, enough bashing on the Motorola, I just want you all to understand the comparison I have to work with.IP cameras?I have been looking for a few months now for a new monitor and have considered IP cameras as a possible solution.  It might be a solution, but the price combined with a lack of a dedicated monitor along with many technical problems made me weary.  Perhaps the more tech savvy folks can make that route work, but I didn't not think it was worth my time.Multiple cam setup?This Samsung baby monitor has the ability to add 3 more cameras which is great if you want to monitor multiple rooms or kids. Pairing the cameras is easy. The actual display is quite nice. It has a belt clip and a stand that swings out.  The stand makes the display sturdy, which was an issue with our previous monitor.  The camera's stand is also very sturdy and adjustments you make hold well.  The camera can be wall mounted as well with the included hardware.I will update this review with my continuing experience, but overall it's the best value.  The reviews are good and it's not so expensive.=========================================As promised I am updating this review.  This monitor is still working flawlessly.  In many other reviews I see complaints about the start-up sound-yeah, its annoying-but it lasts less than 3 seconds.  I have also read that this camera works poorly in low light.  That is absolutely false for me.  Based on other reviews, its safe to say there are some bad units.  Mine is not one of them.  I also have zero wifi interference issues.  I live in a condo building.  There are dozens of wifi signals and that includes mine.  No interference.

Before I made this purchase, I read all the reviews on Amazon and decided to give a try. Let me address couple of issues that other reviewers pointed out. For wireless coverage, I do not find any interference due to router or any other devices. Currently, I'm using a wireless router that provided from Verizon (which is 802.11N) and has wireless bridge for TV and game consoles. Zero interference. But, I definitely agree that 800 ft coverage is not true.

It was very easy to unpack and not wired down like fort Knox. I had it un boxed  and working in less than 5 minutes. You can also purchase additional cams if needed to view on one monitor so that was nice to know but not needed for me. I tested it out one my 5 year old daughter first since she can speak and tell me what she hears and she was able to hear every word I said to her when I pushed the talk button so it must be nice and clear. The video quality is quite nice and clear but i did notice it seems to change over to the black and white screen in slightly lower than average lighting but no big deal. I decided to test  the true real world range and feel way short of the 800 ft claimed. My house is 85 ft long so I had placed the camera at one end of the house and proceeded to walk to the other end and noticed 3/4 way through the walk that the signal would drop real low but if I stopped walking the signal would bounce right back to full. I was able to use it anywhere in my house and never lost signal so that is good. However I continued to walk outside and that was when it started getting not so good. I would say the total useable range of indoors outdoors combined for me was no more than 120 ft. Anymore it would lose signal and beep until I was motionless then it would work again. Max range without walking and this is with the camera indoors and me outside at 150 foot but that was it. I also found that you must have the antenna up while using it clipped to your side and that is not real comfortable and it feels like you may break the antenna off when you bend over or something. If you try to use it clipped to your side with the antenna down it just plain has no range at all. Overall I really like the VOX feature so you don't have the monitor screen on all the time and will only turn on when the baby makes noise. This also helps the battery last much longer when the monitor is not plugged into a power supply. All in all I would say it is a very nice usable system but don't expect to be able to use it at long range like it advertises.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good monitor", "Author": "Karen in Mommyland", "ReviewID": "R1AGQ3F0U4XYIH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Samsung video monitor is our third experience with a video monitor.  When compared to two current monitors from The First Years, I'd say this one measures up to them pretty well.  The picture quality is good and you have the ability to zoom in a bit to get a better look at the baby.  The monitor also has the capability to be expanded up to four cameras.  I imagine this would allow you to have cameras in multiple rooms to check in on more than one child.The camera end of this monitor can be mounted on a wall or placed on a piece of furniture or a shelf to obtain the optimal angle.  Unlike the video monitors from The First Years, this one has a red light on the camera that is constant.  I actually prefer this red light to the irritating bright blue light on the The First Years monitors, especially since the light on those monitors will blink on and off in the baby's room if the parent unit is not turned on.A nice feature on this Samsung unit is you can talk to the baby through it.  The night vision feature is also nice to have.  Our baby sleeps in a completely dark room and it's nice to be able to get a peek at her using this monitor.  It's perfect for parents of babies who are super light sleepers.Now while I really do like this monitor, I have to say that I prefer non-video monitors.  I primarily use the Sony Baby Talk monitor for our daughter and I think the sound quality on that monitor is far better than any of the three video monitors we have.", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "My 2nd Video Monitor, Big Upgrade", "Author": "Scott H. \"Scott H.\"", "ReviewID": "RB730WZJN94NR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I purchased this Video Monitor last week to replace my MobiCam DXR that met it's demise for no apparent reason.  It just wouldn't power on any longer.  To be fair, Mobi is replacing it for free (great customer service) even tho it's outside of it's warranty, but I had to have something in the interim so I read the reviews and purchased the Samsung.  Needless to say, the Samsung is the device that will stay in my baby's nursery.First thing is the design.  The camera and the parent receiver are well designed and feel really well made.  A clear step up over the cheaper feeling DXR.  The screen on the parent monitor is also higher resolution and it is quite a bit clearer overall.  I couldn't really make out the eyes of my baby with the DXR, but I clearly can with the Samsung at about 5 feet away in both night and day modes.  That's not to say that either screen is all that good, they are both pretty bad, but I think that's just the product segment.  I haven't seen any video monitors that are really outstanding in this regard so finding something merely adequate is a good start.The buttons are pretty flush to the unit (especially the menu and sleep buttons) so it's hard to find them when being woken up from sleep in the middle of the night but that's just a minor complaint.  I'm sure with more use, it'll become second nature like it was with the DXR which had quite a few more buttons on the device in general.I also like how the Samsung has the lights on the side of the receiver so you can see noise levels without having to have the volume turned up or have the screen on at all.  I like to sleep with my device muted and the video off because I can hear when the baby gets to the point of crying for food, so with the device muted, I don't hear every little peep out of his room, thus waking me up.  The lights are good enough for a quick glance to see how much of a disturbance he is causing.  Haha.The rest of the features, I don't really use.  The VOX feature sounds cool, and it works great, but I just don't see a need for it at this time.  Maybe in the future.  Same thing with adding multiple cameras...maybe in the future when our baby starts playing outdoors or something.  Plus, I don't see where you can buy extra Samsung cameras anyway, so that'll probably come in the future.To recap, this device is significantly better than the MobiCam DXR that I used for four months before it met it's demise, so I'm happy with my purchase and I'll be recommending it to future mom's and dad's that are on the lookout for a new monitoring system.", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Nice Product", "Author": "UBugMe", "ReviewID": "R3FTQCB7VUY4QX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this for my NEW grandson when he comes over to my house.

Without a standard store receipt they would only repair the product for a $45 fee, which is insane after a $180 product breaks after 3 months.

After I wrote this review I was contacted by the company that sells this Samsung product. They were disappointed to hear that I purchased a product from them that I was not happy with. They offered to exchange the monitor free of charge. They sent a new monitor right to our door within a few days. We then packaged up the old malfunctioning unit and sent it back, no shipping charges to us required. The tune still plays when I turn it on, that can not be helped and maybe with the next monitor Samsung creates they will leave this annoying feature off. I find that the video and sound is clear. Do not expect HD TV quality picture from a monitor, you will not find one. The daytime picture is fine. I can see my baby, eyes closed or open and what is going on. The night vision is just what I expect it to be. It's night vision people, it is not intended to be the best quality picture you could have. You will not see certain colors on the black and white picture, but you will get the idea of what baby is up to. This feature is for checking on your little one to see if they need you in the middle of the night, and it allows me to do just that. I am no longer having the OUT OF RANGE reading when walking around my home either. Overall, I think the Monitor functions just as I need it to and I am happy for the most part with this.*****ORIGINAL POST*****Like so many other reviewers, I did my homework before purchasing this monitor. I have other Samsung products and have been nothing but happy with them. Unfortunately I am not a fan of this monitor. The night vision blinks in and out and I have called support about this issue. They told me that the room must be pitch black in order for the night vision to work. I assured them that the room was completely black. He then told me that it was possibly a manufacturing defect and unfortunately he could not help me with that issue. I would have to first contact Amazon for a return and then if they couldn't help I could call back so they could put in for a service request for the video portion of the unit. He gave me nothing but a run around and in the end didn't help the issue. The tune that the monitor plays is extremely loud with no way to turn it down or mute this. I have to hold the monitor against me to try and muffle the noise. I often get an \"out of range\" signal when I am across my home (about 40 feet, just a bathroom between the monitors.) No other electronics or signal disrupters between the units.The audio is clear and the day video is clear.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed.First, the picture resolution of the SEW-3036WN is not outstanding.  It's better than the cheap video monitors, but it's far from clear.  The publicity pic depicts an image on the monitor that suggests the clarity at least of a close-up photo taken on a smartphone.  This is misleading.  The actual picture display is grainier and small features are indistinct.  It's better than the Infant Optics display, but not great.  I have perfect vision, and I could never tell if my baby's eyes were open.Second, the sound failed within 3 months of having used the monitor.  Our monitor remained in a corner of our kitchen counter, far removed from stove, sink, or anything else that could have damaged it.  It was never dropped or abused.  Nonetheless, about 3 months after we started using it, the sound became fuzzy and indistinct.  Two days later, it died completely.  Now we have a silent video monitor.  Useless!  I bought the monitor in January but didn't install it until early June.  The sound failed in August.  That's pretty darn pathetic.Almost forgot to mention:  that annoying blacking-out during night-vision operation that other buyers have mentioned?  Happened to us, too--frequently.On the plus side, the 2-way mic is awesome; it's great being able to talk directly through the mic to the kids upstairs and then hear them respond.  Also, the plastic housing of the camera and receiver is of good quality.  More like the smooth, solid material of a cell phone than the flimsy plastic of most baby monitors.  Also, the receiver can accommodate up to four cameras, so you can have multiple angles or different rooms under surveillance.  But just how useful is a durable exterior when the critical inner parts have died?After speaking with the merchant, Soltech U.S., I learned that these problems have surfaced in the older batches of this monitor (mine apparently came from one of them).  The representative also assured me, however, that the merchant has raised the issues with the manufacturer, and that they have been addressed so that the newer batches of the monitor should be fine.I am currently waiting on the replacement model, which the merchant was cool enough to send out right away.

This usually woke him up and meant that we'd be in there for a while trying to rub his back and get him to settle back down. With this monitor, the night vision is really crisp and clear - I can see if my child is crying because he's trying to roll over, if he's stuck, if something isn't right, etc. I can see clearly if he needs to sort of fuss it out or if he needs me without actually going in (which normally wakes him up completely once one of us goes in to the room). The range on it is really nice, too. I am able to take the parent unit outside while I get some yard work done and still be able to see in to the room.

I replaced it with a unit that cost approx $140 labelled \"Babies R Us\" that has a 5\" screen with good resolution and excellent night vision.------------------------Original Review:The product arrived promptly and was well packaged. Setup took a matter of seconds. Image quality is about what I'd expect, and the 3.5\" display is elegant and seems to work well. Night vision is good and the microphone is well attenuated.

Driggers", "ReviewID": "RYA63G343GJE4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I registered for this monitor because it had pretty good reviews and appeared to be a great high-end monitor, but after family spent so much money on it, I was extremely disappointed.  Let me detail the many ways it has disappointed:1.  It makes our wireless internet speed 0.002 mgb/sec or something.  I actually didn't realize what was going on until I was on the phone with our internet company and it hit me.  As soon as I turned the monitor off, the speed jumped up to normal.  Ridiculous.  So unless you're looking for a way to keep yourself off the internet while the baby's asleep...2.  It makes a VERY loud and stupid jingle when it turns on.  You cannot turn off this feature.  So don't turn the monitor on before you leave the baby's room or you're liable to have an awake baby once more.3. The night vision function is dysfunctional.  It flicks back and forth between normal and night vision every 3 seconds when there is low light - even when it's pitch black.  Which means every 3 seconds you can't see anything at all.4. And worst of all - and this may be just mine, but 3 times now, the sound has completely stopped working.  The worst time this happened, I had the monitor on the VOX function (which is a great function actually).  Usually, our son wakes me up with his whimpers and grunts, then he eats and easily goes back to sleep.  But when I started back at work, we moved him to his own room so that I could sleep easier. The monitor was supposed to make it so we could still keep an ear out for him at night when he was waking up to eat (versus just breathing loudly enough to wake me up when he was in our room).  But when the sound stopped functioning, I woke up to an inconsolable baby because he had to scream for so long to get my attention.  I felt horrible!5. When I contacted Samsung about these issues, they ignored me.  When I emailed them a second time a few weeks later, but angrier, they finally answered.  But they told me to ask the person who gave it to me for a receipt!  Are you kidding??  I registered for an expensive monitor, friends were kind enough to buy it, and now I'm going to ask them for a receipt so I can return it??  That seems rude to me.  Luckily, Amazon did not ask me to be so rude and they are taking this defective piece of crap back.  I will find another monitor that isn't dysfunctional and poorly designed.", "Date": "July 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works great, battery life is eccellent", "Author": "Alan", "ReviewID": "R2V0395SUPP8E1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted super high quality, portability, long battery life, and a large screen.  This monitor is the best available product to meet those specs.  We love this monitor, it really is portable and the battery lasts plenty long (I think it might be 8 hours, but I never need to use it that long so I just plug it in when done), we left the house with it on the counter unplugged for half a day and it was still on and around 50% when we returned.  Screen resolution is adequate, the portability is the best feature.My wife can take it out in the garden while baby is sleeping (brick house), i can take it into the garage and putter while baby sleeps.  We can carry it all over the house while doing chores.  The range is about 75 feet through a brick wall (antenna down), inside our (~2000 sf) 2 story home it works everywhere including the basement with the antenna down.Another nicety is that the manual is brief and to the point, each icon is explained in about a 2 page spread.Improvement Suggestion #1The switch from color to B&W; (Infrared) seems to be set for a higher light level than I would have chosen, there is a significant decrease in image quality in infrared mode (as is the case with all camera's), but I think the threshold is to early resulting in an unnecessary loss in quality in evening or low light.  An option to change the LUX where this occurs would be a nice touch.Improvement Suggestion #2The belt clip doesn't have much \"bite\", it cant handle thicker belts, or thicker pants.  A belt holster accessory would be a lot better, similar to those for a cell phone.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Great Monitor", "Author": "Lindsey Anderson", "ReviewID": "R3NFLXN5QWBJ5M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We have used this monitor consistently for 4 months.

I decided to go with the Samsung Sew-3036 because the rating was pretty high on Amazon. Some people said they enjoyed the picture quality as well as night vision. The style, user friendly, and the simplicity were also praised upon.

No interference issue what so ever, and range is more than I could ask for.  My house is not a mansion, but the distance between the baby room and master bedroom is pretty far as these 2 rooms are on opposite sides of the house.  With all the walls and furniture in between, I haven\u2019t had any issue.  What I regret most now is not having bought a Samsung baby monitor in the first place with my two previous ones, which I\u2019m sure would\u2019ve lasted a lot longer than the ones I actually used.

I can see my daughter at night, although not with much clarity.  It is easy to use and was a breeze to set up. The controls are intuitive enough. I have it all the way across the room and mostly can tell if she is lying down, sitting up, or wandering around her room.  I suspect it would be a clearer image if it was closer to her, but the intent we had with it was to see what she was up to when she got out of bed.  We used a sound only monitor until moving her to a bed she could get out of on her own.All was going well and then one night we tried using the \"talk\" feature to speak to her and it FREAKED HER OUT.  She was indifferent to the baby monitor the first several weeks we had it, but now we have to coach her through it being \"friendly\" and we had to promise that it would NEVER EVER TALK AGAIN.  She distrusted it and made us cover it up and \"put it to bed\" with a blanket (we still used it for the sound).  Putting eye and smiley face stickers on it (that she chose) has made it less scary and now it looks like the camera part is a huge nose, which is kind of cute.  I suspect it will be several weeks before we no longer have to have conversations about the thing every night before bed, but she has once again started going to sleep without a blanket over it.So, it works, but you might want to be careful on how you introduce that feature.  It certainly was NOT the \"say something to soothe your baby back to sleep\" experience we were hoping it would be. We got something like an hour or more of total freak out followed by days and days of conversations about the monitor and how it is not scary.  My child is accustomed to some other talking toys and has spoken to both of us over the phone, so we figured this would be received a little more like the phone (which was really exciting for her)... but perhaps it is just too much to deal with alone in the dark.  The sound quality is also really a bit funky, so it sounds like a really creepy rendition of mom/dad instead of just sounding like them the way the phone does.

I did extensive reviews of the various video monitors out there, and I determined that the Samsung had all the features I liked, and from what I could tell from the reviews, would be more durable than the Summer monitor.  I read a few negatives on the review for this one that I'd like to address.1. It doesn't mess with our wireless internet.  Some people complained about it slowing down their network.  My husband and I both work from home on the internet, so we would know if our network was slow, and it's not.2. Out-of-range not an issue.  We have a 2 story house with a basement, ~3400 sq ft.  My son sleeps in the top corner of the house, and we watch movies in the basement, and it's still in range.  Haven't tested it outside, but it works everywhere in the house, so that's good enough for me.3.  The little diddy it plays when you turn on the receiver is very annoying.  And, it plays at full volume even if you had the volume set low when you turned it off.  However, I don't really see a need to turn it on when I'm anywhere near my baby.  If I'm near my baby, I don't really need a monitor, do I? So yes, it is loud enough to wake a sleeping child, but there's no need to turn it on near a sleeping child.4. Some people complained about the placement of the buttons.  I don't personally find this to be an issue.  There aren't that many buttons, and it doesn't take long to learn where they are.  I'm only using it with one camera, so perhaps it would be annoying to have to go through the steps to switch cameras if I were monitoring 2 babies.  I'll have to come back and review once I have 2 babies.5. Some people complained of problems switching from day vision to night vision.  Samsung said their monitors were defective, and I think they must have been b/c I haven't had any issues with that.6. Don't know about the durability yet.

(This feature is an absolute must! It allows you to sleep at night without a bright screen on or white noise from the audio portion but you are alerted if you are needed. I will never ever own a monitor without this feature) - Video and audio quality are excellent - Talk feature is handy especially with a toddler when you want to let them know you are coming to get them or tell them to settle down and go to sleep. - It was incredibly easy to pair additional cameras and you can easily go from camera to camera or have it in scan mode where it will automatically switch between cameras every ten seconds. - It has a zoom feature that I will probably never use but it is there if you care about it.The only negatives I can say are: - It is a pricey system especially when you add additional cameras at $99 each. - The screen brightness doesn't dim much so when it comes on at night when in VOX mode it really lights up the room. - A Samsung jingle plays when you turn it on.

(Camera is 640x480 pixels)*  Auto infrared LED lights gives a great picture, even in larger rooms.*  Can add multiple cameras to one monitor and you can have it automatically cycle through them or just stay on one.*  Camera stand is sturdy and holds the camera in place once you get it set, so the camera doesn't move when sliding the switch off or on.*  Two way talk (I don't use this feature much.  My daughter thought it was an animal outside at first.)*  Again, the signal!  I got over 75ft away through five walls and didn't lose one bar of signal strength.*  Digital clock.*  Monitor screen can be turned off (sleep mode) while the microphone and speaker continue to function normally.*  Tone lets you know if the camera connection is dropped.  Great for those parents on the 'safer' side.  :o)Cons:*  Stupid start up melody is loud and can't be turned off.

That feature is the VOX feature. I first saw it the product video on their website as I have done my homework on baby monitor before my purchase. The man in the video described the VOX feature as auto sleep and auto wake function which saves a lot of battery life. That sounded pretty cool so I decided to purchase the Samsung SEW-3036 baby monitor.When I received my baby monitor, I was pleased that installation and usage was very simple. All you need to do is go to menu and go to pairing and press the button on the camera and it pairs within seconds. So to talk about the VOX feature, how it works is that the monitor will go into sleep mode if it does not detect any noise in the baby room for 60 seconds. It will wake up automatically if the baby starts to make noise. This is a very smart and useful feature as it eliminates background noise such as a fan in the baby room. Also, it saves a lot of battery so I do not have to charge very often like the many other baby monitors.One other thing I want to mention is howling. A lot of baby monitors produce howling, a high pitch noise caused when the parent unit and the camera gets too close, but the SEW-3036 produces minimum howling which I appreciate very much. It only produces howling if it gets really close about a foot. This is not bad at all compared to other baby monitors.Overall great baby monitor so do not hesitate to buy if you are in need of a baby monitor.", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "fast and easy set up, but several problems - like wi-fi interference", "Author": "Silea", "ReviewID": "RYFEVF5WQZXXA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First things first: this monitor operates at 2.4GHz, which can interfere with 802.11g or single-band 802.11n routers. If you have such a router, don't get this baby monitor unless you need some way to stop yourself from going online while your baby sleeps.Beyond that, this monitor is really easy to use. It comes all set up such that you can plug it in and go. No set-up required. The picture quality is pretty good, and the sound quality is on par with the audio-only baby monitor i had already.There are some serious problems, though.First off, when you turn on the parent unit (the one with the screen), it plays a little tune. I've found no way to turn that off. Even when the device is muted so i can't hear any sounds from the baby, the darn thing still wants to play me a song when i turn it on. Likewise, if it can't detect the camera, it helpfully beeps at you to let you know. There is no way to disable this audio alert.Second, the camera is basically designed to be wall-mounted. I wanted to set mine up on a dresser near the crib, but the crib mattress is at a much lower level. I can't tilt the camera down enough to get a good angle. If i wanted to screw it into the wall above the crib, it would have good range of motion, but i don't.Third, of course, is that i can only use this device if i want to block all wi-fi in my house. I could go buy a new router to get around this problem, but that's a bit silly.So if you don't use wi-fi for your internet, or have a router other than the type i mentioned above, plan to wall-mount the camera, and remember to never turn the parent unit on near your sleeping baby, this is actually a pretty good video monitor. Otherwise, it's just not.--Update - down to one star:After about 12 hours of use over 3 days, my camera has stopped working properly. It cycles randomly between day and night modes (1-20 seconds in one mode before flipping to the other), even if the room is so dark that on night mode the screen just shows blackness. Unplugging the camera and plugging it back in fixes the problem for an hour or two. I haven't yet contacted tech support, since they're only available by phone, and with a newborn in the house i have precious little time for phone calls, especially when i don't know if it will take 30 seconds or 30 minutes.--Another update:I got an email from a vendor kindly offering to replace my obviously malfunctioning unit. They claim it should _not_ interfere with wi-fi, despite operating on a frequency known to interfere with wi-fi. I'm not going to bother getting the replacement, primarily because the other issues (some of which aren't malfunctions, like the annoying start-up sound) render this monitor useless to me.In addition, i did some experimenting and found that the range of this monitor is less than 50 feet in my house. There are only two walls between my kitchen and the nursery, and probably less than 50 feet, but at my kitchen table the monitor repeatedly cuts out saying it lost signal. Maybe this is yet another aspect of its malfunction, but at the point where a monitor is malfunctioning in three apparently unrelated ways (wi-fi interference, day/night mode switch, and range), it suggests a certain lack of quality in the product.--A third update:I have a 3037 unit as well, the fancier pan-tilt-zoom version. It also interferes with wi-fi. If the wi-fi interference really is a malfunction, then it's a common one across at least two product lines, which seems unlikely.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unfortunately, Samsung disappoints with this product!", "Author": "Tiffany Bryant", "ReviewID": "R16GI9MP9Z5V75", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have to say I am extremely disappointed in this product.

Setup was very easy and everything I originally stated below holds true.HOWEVER, about every week (give or take a few days), the monitor displays an 'out of range' message for both cameras and I have to pair both cameras to the monitor again.  While not difficult, it sort of defeats the purpose of the monitor...which is to monitor.  When we finally get our infant down to sleep, then go downstairs and turn on the monitor and no image shows up, we don't want to go back into the room to disturb the peacefully sleeping little guy...at least not for a good few minutes.So I called Samsung tech support thinking this was a defective unit and hoping to exchange it, and the representative told me this is how the monitor is designed!  So this is actually a design flaw.  Apparently, if there is any interference, the monitor drops the camera and you have to manually pair again.  I would think it a simple matter to save the radio frequency settings in memory so once you move the monitor closer or the interference clears, the video returns automatically without the need to pair again.Samsung, fix this issue and your product rating will improve dramatically!+++++++++++++++++++++++We just received the Samsung SEW-3036 video baby monitor and as soon as I turned it on, I was impressed.  The display is large and the image quality is incredibly clear.  What impressed me most was just how clear the image quality is in both light and dark environments - there is a light sensor on the camera that detects lighting and switches the camera from normal light (full color video) to minimal/no light (black and white video utilizing the infrared LEDs).  Also, setup of the camera and monitor is super simple (however, if you are not handy with technology, you should read the manual to dig into the menu settings...but it's all really pretty straightforward once you become familiar with it).We now have two children and purchased this for our newborn who is just 1 week old.  After seeing the quality, we will likely ditch our old monitor we were using for our first child and simply purchase an additional camera since the Samsung is expandable and sounds very easy to connect the additional camera to the monitor -- simply hit the 'pairing' button on each device and you're all set.  What's nice is that the monitor itself has a scan feature so the video/audio will switch between the cameras automatically every 10 seconds.I would have given this product a 5 star rating, but I literally took it out of the box today, so would want some more time with it before giving it a perfect score.  Also, while the camera is very easy to mount (there is even a mounting template included in the instruction manual) and you can pivot the camera to multiple angles, the camera is vertically aligned while the monitor is horizontally aligned.  It would be perfect if you had the option to turn the camera 90 degrees so that the length of the crib fit into the longest viewing dimension of the camera and thus the monitor.  It's not a major factor since you can simply mount the camera on a different wall to achieve the same 90 degree angle, but if you only have one wall option for mounting, you may have to mount the camera farther back to get everything in frame. Fortunately, the monitor also comes with a 2x zoom and pan feature so even if you are farther back, you can always zoom in to get a closer look.I would also recommend that the monitor stand should pivot 90 degrees so you have the option of setting the monitor down on either its horizontal or vertical edge.All things considered, these are pretty minor improvements and it would not have prevented me from purchasing this monitor.  Like I said, I'll likely get the second add on camera to place in our other child's room...so we just have one monitor to carry around.  What's nice too is that there is a VOX setting that turns off the display to conserve batter, but automatically turns on when a noise is sensed by the respective camera...and you can adjust the sensitivity (hi/low) to pick up the slightest sound or only the big cries.Lastly, there's even a talk button on the monitor so you can use it like a walkie-talkie if you need to soothe with your voice or communicate with your spouse from another floor.  Even the volume of the speaker on each camera can be individually controlled and set all from the monitor.

I need one with a VOX feature, and this has it, plus a lot of other features my old (now broken) Infant Optics monitor didn't have.  So I was disappointed to find that as soon as we plugged it in, we started seeing the same defect that several other reviewers complained about--the night vision blinks in and out.  So you can see your kid for a few seconds, then the screen goes black (because the room is dark, duh), and then it comes back on for a few seconds, repeatedly, for as long as you have the video function engaged.  I called Samsung and they were polite but completely useless.

Also, last night after baby was in bed, I turned the monitor on to discover it was \"out of range\" even though I was 15 feet from the camera.  Turns out it had come unpaired somehow.  I had to sneak in and push a button on the camera to fix it.  Hopefully that's a one-time issue, though I will say it's way too easy to unpair the camera through the menu.

The wireless range was good. I didn't have any problem receiving the video signal from one side to the other side of my house. I just had to take the antenna out on the monitor. Also I did not have any WIFI interferences during use. I have both 2.4 and 5 GHz WIFI running at home with at least ten wireless devices connected and everything worked fine. I found that the battery on the monitor lasted a couple of hours, but it does have a sleep button to conserve battery power if I want to turn off the screen. The audio is still active and picks up sound during the sleep mode as well.Overall, this is very basic baby monitor. There is nothing fancy about this monitor in any aspects such as feature or design. Having said that, in my opinion, this baby monitor is priced too high for what it is. There are many baby monitors with similar features for less money, or you can find better equipped home monitor systems for under $200 these days. There are many alternatives that you can use your existing iPhone or android phone for less spending as well. However, if you just want a simple and basic baby monitor, this will do the job.", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent delivery", "Author": "Jake", "ReviewID": "R33QBAK2C0GK27", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow I purchased this item on Thursday, and I received it on Monday even though UPS does not work on weekends.

This camera here was my second to last choice after going through many many cameras. Including all the summer ones and even the camera for the iPhone. I went through 5 before this one and got no where my last options was this one or the Motorola Digital Video Baby Monitor with 3.5\" Color Screen and Wireless Camera - MBP 34. I'm telling you now this camera was TERRIBLE!!! The color and Resolution was so bad I couldn't even tell if my baby's eyes were open. It looks like night vision with the lights on. Everything looks purple and grey. I was so disgusted!! It's blurry and so not crispy for what it costed. I went straight back out and returned and got my last and final camera choice. The Motorola Digital Video Baby Monitor with 3.5\" Color Screen. Now finally!!! This is it!! If you wanna save the trouble just go out and buy this one it's 209 dollars and worth every penny! Crispy beautiful color I can zoom up so close I can see if my baby is breathing I mean its wonderful. The biggest mistake I made was buying and not checking reviews or even the store that sold this monitors on so you can check them out yourself. Babiesrus is we're I found this one and got to test it out before hand and I wish I would've just listen to my gut instinct and bought this one from the get!

Every day I need to take care of my baby at home. However, I usually feel worried especially when I cook the dinner in the kitchen and suddenly everything becomes quiet, because I can't see what he is doing. Until one day I saw this baby monitor online and purchased it immediately. When I got this product, its performance really shocked me. The image is of very high quality and can keep the high quality even at a distance. For example, when I leave my baby in the bedroom and I go out to water my followers, I can still see him and talk to him. Its night version also helps me a lot. After I got this product I didn't need to get up and walk a few meters to his cradle at night. What I need to do was pressing the power button, watching his lovely face in the dark, and then continuing sleeping even without turning it off because it can go to sleep automatically in 1 min and wake up when there is noise.

From the reviews, I felt that this monitor must be the best. Does it do the job? Absolutely! Are there things I'm frustrated about? Absolutely.Ill focus on the positive first. The screen is great and the infrared vision in a dark room is great. I do appreciate that I can roll over in bed and make sure my baby is breathing.Now there are a few things that I'm very frustrated with. 1) The camera monitor (the one that stays in the baby's room) has a short cord so be prepared to mount it close to an outlet. Not all homes have outlets on all four walls so this may affect how you decorate your nursery 2) The battery life for the parents monitor (the one you hold) is way too short. This has a relatively long cord which is nice but it only lasts a few hours when not plugged in. That is not very helpful when you wake up to a black screen b/c the battery died. Ugh. 3) I get frustrated every night because there is a very annoying and loud tune that the parents monitor plays when you turn it on? What is Samsung thinking? Isn't the purpose of a monitor to watch a SLEEPING baby. Why would you have such a loud on/off tune when the baby is sleeping. There is no way to turn the sound off and I cringe every night when I turn it on.I'm just venting b/c I see room for improvement on what could be the perfect monitor.

Just all of a sudden, no sound!!! We are absolutely horrified. We have no idea how long our baby had cried for. This is just terrible. Aside from that, it also has the blinking defect where at night the screen turns black every 2-3 seconds. We tries calling Samsung, spent over an hour on the phone but with no use.

It constantly flipped back and forth between day and night modes every few seconds, no matter what the light level was in the room, making the monitor unusable.Called up Samsung and they told me that the camera was broken, manufacturer's defect, and offered to fix it. They were very nice on the phone, only catch is that they would need to keep it for at least 2 days, and possibly even a week to fix and send back, without any substitute or replacement. We could not sleep without a monitor for our infant for even a night so this was not an option for us as we had no backup. I told them this and they said there was nothing they could do--company policy. I told them I would have to go out and buy another monitor, I couldn't wait on them for up to a week without a monitor.This may have just been an isolated incident, but I did see at least two other posts complaining of this same problem. I tried putting black tape over the light sensor, as one user recommended, but this did not fix the problem. There's also no way to manually set it on day or night mode, so it would just continuously flicker and blink, obscuring the video.Called Amazon and they graciously allowed us to return the item so we could buy a new one. (This was amazing, thank you Amazon!!)Got a Motorola instead and have had it for a few weeks now. Very happy with the new one. Wanted to post on here to save people a little headache in case they are looking for a monitor, a few points of comparison between Samsung and Motorola:1. The Motorola allows you to pan and tilt with the receiver so you do not need to go in the baby's room to position the camera.2. The zoom in feature on the Motorola is much clearer as is the overall picture quality. On the Samsung it was ok, but a bit blurry and the night mode was very grainy relative to the Motorola.3. The audio quality on the Motorola is ok, but I think the Samsung might be marginally better.4. The Motorola does NOT make any startup sound. The Samsung makes a very loud startup tune, which is annoying and can also wake up the baby/parents. There's no way to turn off the startup tune.5. The stand for the Motorola is a bit sturdier, but the Samsung is about the same, flimsier plastic though on the Samsung.6. The screen on the Samsung is slightly larger, but does not matter because the picture quality is so much crisper on the Motorola. On the Motorola I can actually see my baby's face and body moving, on the Samsung I could not see that level of detail.7. The menu navigation is equally good with both monitors.8. The buttons on both monitors are configured differently, so some people may prefer one over the other, but I was fine with either.9. The price was virtually the same for both--at the time of writing about $180 for either one. So price did not sway either way.Bottom line, if the Samsung works, I'm sure it's a fine monitor, not the best, but functional. Ultimately, their return/repair policy was not acceptable, but Amazon saved the day, and could not be happier with the new Motorola monitor.
