The camera has built in audio but was not nearly sensitive enough. This mic picks up EVERYTHING. I need a way to shield it from wind, but other than that it is really cool to hear chickadees make sounds I never new they made while feeding. I can even hear people walking up the walkway to my office door. Neat!", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic clarity and pick up!", "Author": "Michele Bowman", "ReviewID": "R1JFJBVW9Y9AQ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great!
