{"Reviews": [{"Title": "You will not be disappointed with the Power Case DVR", "Author": "KF8107", "ReviewID": "R1VPBI0K0YL7QE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is tremendously cool and extremely well made. Cell phone cameras come in all shapes and sizes but fail where this one succeeds. The camera automatically adjust so I can literally be in record mode, rotate the device 180 degrees and the camera will rotate with my adjustment to insure the video being recorded is properly orientated. The other amazing feature is the \"Night Mode\" for those of you who are avid camera enthusiast you're probably familiar with HDR - for those who are not, simply put; it improves the clarity of the image(or in this case video) when your lighting is low. You can take 1080p video with this device(excellent) and/or high-res snap shots. Between the camera quality, manufactured quality, night mode, and auto camera orientation this is the best handheld hidden camera available. Definitely worth the money - you will not be disappointed!", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$425.00", "Features": "Automatic Camera Orientation - camera is always in correct position regardless of phone face up or down\nTrue High Definition Video Resolution - 1080P or 720P @ 30FPS\nNight Mode: Get built in High Dynamic Range (HDR) technology that records clear images in low light\nVibration Alerts Indicating Power On, Recording, Snapshot Modes have been Enabled\nTotally self recording, does not need a functioning iPhone to work", "Name": "Power Case DVR HD Hidden Camera Disguised as an Extended Battery Case for iPhone 4 and 4S", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qDxe2EU3L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00GUSQQOK"}}
