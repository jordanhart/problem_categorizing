{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Hootoo HT-IP207 IP Wired/Wireless Network review", "Author": "P.G.", "ReviewID": "R2JEBIHHABXQAL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera met most of my criterion for outdoor (see caveat below) monitoring.Setup was a breeze, connected it first to the wired network, you  do not need to install any of the s/w which comes with the box if you know how to locate  the IP of this camera on your router.Once you have the IP from the wired connection, use chrome (other browsers may need video add ins) to directly http into the camera.Setup the wireless connection, disconnect the wired IP and power off/on, the camera comes back on the wifi (of course with a different IP),After this, I installed outside (CA weather is mild, and it is protected from rain).Works perfectly, setting up automated emails upon motion detect is also easy provided you know your email provider's server and port details.It does have a tendency to false trigger (ex. shadow of an object moving outside the capture zone, some of the times the pictures captured (6 snapshots sent for every event) have no one in them, so I have to play with the sensitivity and capture delay setting.Default camera setting seem to work well for day or night (switches automatically).They have a handy calendar option for enabling snapshots only for the days/times that you want.My issue is that the angle of view is somewhat limited, so I have to play with \"patrol\" option and see how well the motion trigger works after thatCannot seem to limit the range of the \"patrol\" motion, all or nothingI have not yet set up FTP or DDNS access but do not expect it to be that difficult given the experience so farAll in all, great starter IP cam for the price/performance this offersCaveat:This camera was stated to be an indoor/outdoor in the description \"Water-proof structure best for outdoor installation\", not sure if this means it was already water proof or it needs a waterproof enclosure!", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0073NMKA0"}}
