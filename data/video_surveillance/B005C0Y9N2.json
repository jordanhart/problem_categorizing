good indication of the quality. Definitely not HD, but good enough for less than $10 shipped. The video bounces a bit but there were six buzzards circling with me so I decided to dogfight them a little, the camera was pointed at a 30 degree angle so you don't see many of the buzzards.The durability of the camera is why I am reviewing it. After realizing it was a bit too much for my smaller plane, I noticed it had come loose at some point. two days of heavy rain later and I find it in my yard, pop the case open, give it 12 hours to dry out and it comes right on, I check the video and see how I lost it, it is behind me while I checked the plane, and as I see that it's gone, I step back to look around and step right on it, driving it into the grass further. But it is back in service and I have no complaints.", "Date": "October 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Exactly as pictured, instructions are poorly translated", "Author": "Tech Guy", "ReviewID": "R3B2QU6LCBSG44", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Mine arrived exactly as pictured, with a USB cable.You'll need to pick up a microSD card, and you're already on Amazon!Specs:720x480 AVI video format1280x1024 still image280mha 3.7v internal USB rechargeable battery.Instructions:Hold the bottom button down until the yellow light comes on.Hold the top button until it flashes 3 times.BadaBing!

Quality of videos really great for the 10 bucks you pay.This was in a bright room, quality will probably degrade in a darker room. Sound quality good too.

However, the only way my quality came close to his was on a bright day and holding the camera completely still.  Any movement would blur the video.  How he strapped his to an RC plane and got that quality - I don't know.  Indoors, forget about it!  Even after bringing out my studio lighting - the images were dark.  It looked like a webcam from the early 90's.I can see how some people could fall in love with this, after all, its a camera in a remote control and its only $10.  I was hoping to use it to record my daughter doing silly stuff in situations where bringing out my real digi cam would distract her, but this product isn't going to work.If you're still reading this review, maybe you're serious enough to appreciate the following information.  After doing more research I found one of these Remote Cams that actually record in True HD.  Its called an 808 #11.  Apparently there are several companies that manufacture these and all but one use the SD imaging.  It's more expensive, about $35, but Im sure with HD resolution this is a cool product.  I didn't find any on Amazon, only Ebay.The only plus side - I bought two of these, and doubled my money selling them on Craigslist!

The video is fantastic especially considering the price and size of the camera. Press and hold the front button until the yellow light comes on. Then for still pictures, press the back button once, \"click\" you just took a photo. Continue this same process for additional still photos. For video, press and hold the back button until the yellow light flashes three times, you are now recording video. to stop the video recording, press and hold the back button again until the yellow light flashes another three times. Then you can repeat the same processes again. Simply put, the front button is the on/off switch and the back button controls the photo and video operation. The battery seems to operate the camera for at least 20-25 minutes of continuous video recording. However there is no way to really know when the battery is charged when plugged in. To obtain a full charge. Leave it plugged in for one and a half to two hours. As a side note you should allow the battery to die first before charging again. Constantly plugging the camera in will decrease the battery life significantly.

In comparison, the resolution of the Swann spy pen is much better, but I like the recording mode of this car remote V-cam as it does NOT have a flashing light when recording like the Swann spy pen (that simply broadcasts, hey guys, I'm secretly recording...)", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Item Received has  NO Resemblance to item pictured", "Author": "Puff n Fluff* \u00ae\u2122 \"Puff*\"", "ReviewID": "R12CLM9Y7RRM92", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "**ZERO** stars for this item.First of all the \"camera\" we received was not in a box as pictured.And we have not been able to try it to see if it works.

The case many times is the only thing that is the same.  The internals (the camera), battery, resolution, etc are all different.  Some have a HD, stutter free picture and some have a lower resolution picture that stutters and drops frames.  I suggest checking out Youtube for reviews on the various cameras and the various places that are selling them.  One of the best types of these keyfob/remote cameras with the best picture,etc is known as the 808 #11 or 808 #16.  These can ONLY be purchased on Ebay from a particular seller who is also the manufacturer from what I understand.  They cost around $25-$30 US.  All the other ones are different resolutions/batteries/quality and you really don't know what you are getting.People need to also realize that not all the reviews they are reading right now for THIS particular item being sold on Amazon are from people who bought THIS PARTICULAR ITEM ON AMAZON.  Some bought something that LOOKED the same on Ebay or Craig's List, etc.  They THINK they are helping because they think they are reviewing the same camera because it looks exactly the same.  However, they are not the same unless they bought the exact same unit HERE from THIS AD and even then they can't be 100% sure unless they know the seller.  The seller themselves might be substituting different/cheaper kefob/remote cameras from a different source.  I'm not saying they are but they COULD be.PLEASE if you leave a review of this product list WHERE you purchased it.  If you purchased it from THIS Amazon add, say so.  If you purchased it off of Ebay, say so.  That's the only way people reading it will know.  Reading a positive add for a black keyfob/remote camera bought off of Ebay will mean nothing for someone buying from this ad here on Amazon because the cameras are all different.Lastly, my actual review (number of stars) means nothing as this was just an informational post to make people aware that there are SO many different kinds of these cameras and they are all different.", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Doesn't even work", "Author": "Chris L", "ReviewID": "R1DUUGU77VUJVB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I charged the item for the last 24 hours and still it only works if it is plugged in.

I have not run the battery empty yet after more than 2hours of use.They also work great as a dash cam!Let other people pay 80$ or more for expensive dashcams, just get one of these.The only singular negative critic I can think of for this cam is that the lense is not a wideangle lense.It seems to have a focal length of about 50mm, so for example if you want to use it as a dash cam, you have to aim it just right, in this case a 35 or smaller lense would be better.But for most purposes this is a moot point.At 10 bucks just buy some and experiment!There is also a video in youtube on the controls and buttons, the instructions for this device are in the usual \"chinglish\" that make no sense at all.", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exactly as pictured!", "Author": "Chad G.

So far I have four weeks it has been so great to me and the pictures still comes out real great and also the videos it comes out real great and Sharp what I paid for it has been so good I recommend to buy this product just because it has been working properly so far I had it.All the people who question you guys asking me how looks like you how to use it this is how you use it when you see the lights blinks twice and it will stay on steady then you will get the small button and you will see the light blinks three times. Then it will go off that means you are recording the video now I will explain to you how you make the pictures you would hit the big button it will blink twice it will stay on steady then you hit the small button once then you will see the links one time that means you just made one picture do you get that so far but please don't ask me stupid question but that does not make any sense to me I have it for four weeks I don't have no problems with it \"videos pictures \"I don't have any problems at all either one of those two. Please read the manual carefully, you will understand what they talked about before you use it do you get that so far . Before you send me any complements make sure you make some sense maybe you don't speak English right or don't know how to write at all get someone else knows how to speak in which explain to them how you want to write it .I stil have no  problem's from August 1, 2012 to September 5, 2012 and stil work's real great .
