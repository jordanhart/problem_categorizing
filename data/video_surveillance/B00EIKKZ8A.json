Just by taking that spool box out of the delivery box resulted in a ripped handle.  I tried to use the other handle to carry it and with just a slight pull the other handle ripped too.  I'm not sure about other installers, but I need something with durable handles so i can easily carry around the rg59 spool during installations.  I had to return this,I hope GW Security ships future rg59 spools in more durable carrying boxes.  I just purchased a CIB rg59 spool from amazon (no prime shipping but at least if was free) and the handles on the spool box are reinforced with a plastic grip and the box is much sturdier and has yet to break on me.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$89.99", "Features": "500 Feet Spool In A Box\nRG59 Siamese Power/Video Combo Cable\nRG59\nvideo cable\ncable", "Name": "500 Feet RG59 Siamese Power & Video Combo Cable for CCTV Surveillance Video Camera Security System (500ft Spool In A Box)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51jIcd748YL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00EIKKZ8A"}}
