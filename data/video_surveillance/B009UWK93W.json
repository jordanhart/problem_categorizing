{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Don't by this if you want to see details like faces and license plates", "Author": "James Higginbotham", "ReviewID": "R1H2VHLHYEU0S2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Terrible product. After contacting support, I found out that the 16 channel has a more limited recording resolution than the 4/8 channel - not documented anywhere. In live mode, the cameras have limited resolution and cannot be used to make out a license plate or facial features at only 4 feet away in daytime. The software interface is clunky. I returned this and will wait until I can afford a nicer DVR system and higher quality cameras.Pro tip: after I purchased the system, I started searching YouTube for examples of recordings from the kit. I wish I had done that before, as they demonstrate the poor quality of the unit. Do some checking in forums or YouTube for demonstrations or still shots that will provide you with a better idea of the camera quality.", "Date": "April 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good quality surveillance system", "Author": "Ben Burke", "ReviewID": "RGGDGM3TU6WD5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Defender USA has a surveillance system that uses the H.264 video compression technology which is the widely accepted standard.  While this is not 1080P high definition, it does provide ample resolution to identify subjects that come into a camera's field of view.  The company claims the 1 TB hard drive will provide 4 years of video data storage, but you will not get anywhere near this amount of time if you use 30 frames per second, which I chose for a more accurate video playback.  Based on my four days of use, I'm estimating one month of video data storage which is plenty for my needs.The DVR is small and has no front panel buttons; every menu option is only accessible with either the included mouse or the remote.What impressed me most with this system is the cameras.  No cheap plastic housing; these cameras are housed in heavy metal.  One small complaint is the size of the hole (5/8\") that must be drilled to feed the small siamese cables' BNC connectors through. It would be better to design a quick disconnect for the power and BNC connectors on each end of the cable.  This would allow a much smaller hole to be drilled.This system includes a one year warranty, but Defender USA will double that warranty to two years for the submission of this review.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent Camera System With Some Minor Problems", "Author": "R.

I seriously doubt you will get it done in less than 2 days, unless you install security systems professionally. Plan out the wiring lengths, and the power access points carefully! And before you start drilling and running cable, test all of the components, and make sure everything is working. Configure the router/central box and test out the various features you plan to use, before you start to alter your house.Overall, it is a good system, but it could be a little bit better. I wish at least some of the cameras were wireless, so running power to all of the cameras wasn't such a problem, and I wish that the end-caps for the wiring weren't so huge, and I wish that the manual came printed out, instead of on a mini-CD. And the configuration of the system to communicate wit mobile devices was especially painful. But, the core system of the cameras, wiring and power all worked flawlessly, and that is what is important.4 stars.", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy set-up, smart device gives worldwide online security cam access to location", "Author": "Andrea Polk", "ReviewID": "R3ODY7T6TH12EK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this item through the Amazon Vine reviewer program, and have no prior knowledge of or experience with security cameras and systems.I do have experience building desktop PCs, setting up home theater systems and home networking computers.  I am also pretty good about finding information and reading directions. That being said, my review is not that of a professional installer of these systems, but rather your average Joe (or Josephine...) and my experience with this product.  Admittedly a tad long, it icludes my impressions of the product as well as specific info, some of it taken directly from the manufacturer's website (as noted).NOTE: Some areas on this Amazon product page say product info is for 4-Channel/4-Camera unit - this is for the 8-Channel, 4-camera Defender Sentinel set-up, which is what I received.IN THE BOX:DVR with 500GB HDD4 Outdoor Security Cameras4 65ft Extension CablesPower AdapterFour-to-One Power SplitterMounting Hardware2 BNC to RCA Connectors10ft RJ-45 Ethernet Cable6ft Power Adapter (cUL certified)6ft RCA video cableInstruction Manual & Software CDUSB MouseIR Remote Controller with batteriesQuick Start GuideWindow Warning StickersBEFORE INSTALLATION:Go to the Defender-USA website and click SUPPORT.  Go down to INSTALLATION TIPS and click 'CLICK HERE' to view Camera Mounting Tips.  This takes you to YouTube and DefenderDIY's channel of videos which will help you to visualize your installation.I highly recommend watching the Defender 5-Step DVR Set-up Tutorial.  You can do it with just the Quickstart Guide, but this was very helpful to me as I'm a 'visual' learner.Defender's YouTube channel is a great resource (40 videos - most helpful) for installation and operation of this system.If you don't have Internet access, or prefer a printed version, you can view the PDF User's Manual which comes on the min-sized CD packaged with this system.All of the 'How-To' will be found in these two sources, as the Quick Start Guide - 1 sheet with a basic diagram - is minimal and not very helpful for set-up and use.INSTALLATION: CAMERASRecommendations on placement of the 4 included outdoor cameras can be found in the PDF instructions and at the Defender-USA website.  The 4 included outdoor cameras are the 600TVL series high-definition cameras which make seeing details in video images much more likely.  The picture quality is very good and color reproduction seemed true in the cameras I received.You can buy additional cameras for this security set-up, as it has 8-channels (8 cameras) and there is an input for audio input via microphone. Defender has information on how to order more cameras, cable and accessories in the box.If you want to purchase a Defender Pro Sentinel set-up with more cameras from Amazon consider these: Defender 21116 PRO Sentinel 16CH Smart Security DVR with 8 Hi-Res Outdoor Security Cameras or Defender 21113 PRO Sentinel 8CH Smart Security DVR with 8 Hi-Res Outdoor Security Cameras.Mounting screw hardware for the included 4 outdoor cameras are included, as well as 65' of PRO FT4 cabling with each camera. This cable is rated for professional installation through walls, approved for fire safety.You can mount these cameras on desktops and ceilings too, but the mounts that these cameras shipped with are specifically for outdoor installation.The end of the camera cords that go to the DVR have yellow (to the DVR) and red (to the 'octopyus' like power cord that is one of two AC adapters that ship with the unit.Cameras are set to record as 'always on', but you can set them up to record on a schedule or be motion-activated, which can so be modified to fit your situation.  For example if you live on a busy street, you can block certain recorded areas from tripping the motion detection.You can set up 'Privacy Zones'; up to 4 per camera, and run cameras in 'Covert Mode' with password protection.  The cameras will appear not to be live on the montitoring screen to unauthorized users, but they will actually be recording.INSTALLATION: DVRIf you can hook-up a DVD player, you can hook up this system!In the box you'll find the DVR, USB Mouse, remote for DVR, 2 AA batteries (for remote), Network cable, AC power supply for DVR (short cord on this one...), CD for software installation and PDF User's Manual.Again, look at the DefenderDIY YouTube videos to see how to set-up the DVR if it's unclear to you.A Quickstart Guide is included and small label tabs are on some items that say 'For DVR' or similar.The unit comes in two boxes, one with cameras and cabling, and the other with the DVR and its accessories.  The box with the cameras looks overwhelming, but basically, it's just a lot of cords!DVR UNIT:On the back of the DVR are 8-channels (hook-ups0 for cameras, audio 'in', audio 'out',and 2 USB ports (use 1 for included mouse and the other for a back-up hard drive like Seagate Backup Plus 3 TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive (STCA3000101).  The DVR has a 500GB hard drive with overwrite feature, and Defender says you can store up to 4 years worth of footage on it, so an external back-up would only be necessary if you want to archive footage. NOTE:  If reviewing archived footage, you can search for items by event, putting in a specific search timeline to view.I hooked mine up to a PC monitor via the VGA hook-up.  You can also view what the camera is seeing via a TV by using the video out (yellow) ended cord which is included.  The VGA cable is not included with this package.The front of the unit has two lights on the upper left hand side (facing the unit).  One is green, it remains steady when the DVR has powered on and one is red, it blinks as the DVR is recording.You can use the Defender remote control to enter modifications, set networking information, etc..., no matter what monitoring device (TV or PC monitor) you're using.  When using the PC monitor and mouse you can right click to get more options to menus to adjust and set-up the system.The DVR is set to NTSC video format by default, but can be changed to PAL in settings.Menus in English, French, Russian, Italian, Portugesse, Spanish and Romanian are given.Once you have hooked up your cameras to the back of the DVR, connected a TV or PC monitor, connected the USB mouse, and powered up the unit by plugging in the AC adapter, you should see a picture on your monitor with 4 or 8 channels (depends on your settings when the unit powers up).Depending upon how many cameras you have hooked up, and what channels they are connected to, you will see corresponding video streams from these cameras.  These streams will not be recording until you set them up!NETWORKING & WORLDWIDE ACCESS:The networking features are more complex to set-up, but again, check out the YouTube DefenderDIY tutorial videos and the PDF Owner's Manual on the CD for that information.Once your DVR is networked, you've got an AMAZING tool at your disposal for keeping an eye on your location from anywhere in the world!You can access your control panel for the system via the Internet or an app that can be used by iPhones, BlackBerry Bold, or Android phones.You can also receive email security warnings based upon parameters you set-up in Advanced tools.CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATION:1. Easy to install and use.2. Quality built.3. Video quality and zoom feature are excellent.4. Highly customizable.5. Online networking for remote views with email warnings, and apps for viewing while away from location.6. Like that you can back-up to external hard drive.7. Would work for home or business.8. Security settings allow for 'covert' surveillance.9. Adjustments for privacy areas and adjustments for motion sensitivity are nice perks!10.Great tool for monitoring any area in light and dark situations.While the price will be prohibitive to some, the Defender Pro Sentinel 8CH Smart Security DVR with 4 Hi-Res Outdoor Security Cameras is a great product, with excellent support and tutoriials online.The PDF Owner's Manual is well written and easy to follow.The toughest part about the installation of this unit for most people will be getting the cameras located and properly adjusted, and the setting up the networking components.  Both can be done by anyone, it will just take a bit of time to read or view how-to videos, and patience.If you want security for your business or home that you can monitor no matter where you are, I highly recommend this system which has great features and room to grow!ITEM SPECIFICATIONS PER DEFENDER WEBSITE:DVRFunctionality PentaplexVideo Compression H.264Audio Compression G.711Number of Channels 4Video Input 4/8 x BNCVideo Output 2 x BNCVGAAudio Input 2 x RCAAudio Output 1 x RCAUSB Port 2Resolution 800x600, 1024x768, 1280x1024Recording Total Frame Rate NTSC\uff1a60fps@D1\u3001120fps@HD1\u3001120 fps@CIF PAL\uff1a50fps@D1\u3001100fps@HD1\u3001100fps@CIFRecording Frame Rate Per Channel NTSC: 1fps~30fps adjustablePAL: 1fps~25fps adjustableRecording Resolution NTSC : D1(704 X 480), HD1(704 X 240), CIF(352 X 240) / PAL: D1(704 X 576), HD1(704 X 288), CIF(352 X 288)Recording Modes Motion Record, Schedule, AlwaysPre Recording Max 10 secondsPost Recording Max 5 minutesRecording Media HDD (Backup via USB)Storage Capacity Max 1TB HDDHDD Type SATA 3.5\"Storage Capacity Max 1TB (HDD)Video Format NTSC/PALVideo Loss Alarm Auto Detect AlarmAudio Bitrate 8 kbpsLive Frame Rate 30 FPSLive Viewing Full, Quad, PIP, ZOOM, SEQPicture-in-Picture YesNetwork Protocol TCP/IP, DDNS, DHCP, PPPoE,UDPNetwork LAN IP Static, DynamicNetwork Connection 10/100 BaseT Ethernet (RJ-45)Supported Operating Systems Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, OSX 10.5 or aboveBrowsers Internet Explorer, SafariBack-up USB Flash drive, USB disk & networkPlay Search Mode Time/Date, Event listPlay Speed 2x, 4x, 8x, 16xPan/Tilt/Zoom RS-485 Pelco D & POSD Language Display Multi-LanguageTime and Date Stamp Display YesPassword Protection Yes, Menu Password, Clear HDD PasswordOperating System LinuxProcessor ARM 9Disk Full Warning YesAutomatic Overwrite Option YesLED Indicators Power, HDDHousing Material AluminumHousing Color Black/SilverPower Input 12V DC 3APower Consumption 10W~15WPower Adapter Input 100V 50/60HZ~240 50/60HZOperating Temperature 32\u00b0F~104\u00b0FOperating Humidity 10%~90%Dimensions 8.75x11x2\"Weight 3.75 lbsCamerasImage Sensor 1/3\" CMOSResolution 600 TVLOutdoor Use YesIP Rating IP65Focal Length 5mmFocus Type FixedOptimal Focal Distance 20 ft.Night Vision YesNumber of IR LEDs and Range 36Night Vision Range 100ftIR LED Control Automatic (CDS Sensor)Min.

Mahoney", "ReviewID": "R36MXLU66JEFJY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have a lot of issues with this product, but to sum it up, the cameras seem to be ok but the DVR isn't close to what the description makes it out to be. Do not buy this if you want a real security camera system.I purchased this camera system after my truck was broken while parked in my driveway in front of my home.I began by setting up the system and connecting all four cameras to ensure everything worked properly, which it did. I got good images on all four cameras, they switched from day to night more with a click from the relay. Next I got the network setup to allow me to hide the DVR away in my closet. I completed the installation and setup over the network.I installed three of the four cameras in strategic spots around the outside of my house to allow me to monitor these areas. I next configured the alarm and recording settings. After playing with the various resolutions, I settled on the highest as the other settings where inadequate. In order to make out facial features, the person had to be no further than 5-8 feet from the camera. Considering the camera was mounted 15 ft off the ground, this only leaves a little margin. Here is when the real issues became apparent....I could not get the recording resolutions and other settings to work in the highest resolution. I tried many combinations and in the end, I had to call customer service. After sitting on hold for 10 mins I got online and tried their chat interface. After another 5 - 10 mins, a rep connected with me on chat. After going around and around with this person telling me my network was to blame and another 5 mins, I was finally connected with a rep on the phone. She also insisted at first the issues I was seeing was because I was connected to the DVR over my local network and that they do no support a switch between the DVR and my laptop. Being a network engineer, I found this ridiculous and insisted we move on. What I did find out after some persistence was that the DVR only supports 50 fps across ALL cameras in the highest resolution setting....or that is what they were telling me. In reality, what I found was that it actually only supported 4 fps for one camera in the highest setting. However, when you play it back, the playback speed is accelerated and seems to be proportional to the fps setting. For example, when you set it to 4 fps, it plays back at 4x normal speed. I have since been able to get the middle resolution to work at 8 fps on three cameras. Next I turned my attention to the motion detection and alarms....I had originally placed the cameras in my attic while I was running the cables. At the default sensitivity, the motion alarm when off every three minutes (also a default setting) even though nothing in the cameras view was moving. I've since mounted them all outside. I've had to turn down the sensitivity all the way to the lowest to keep the alarm from constantly going off. In addition to a car or person coming into the field of view, I've the following is a list of other things which set off the motion alarm. The list was compiled at the lowest sensitivity.snow falling from the skysnow falling from trees which previously had fallen from the skyrain falling from the skybirdssquirrelsblowing treesshadows of blowing treeschanging from day to nightchanging from night to dayspiders (that was pretty cool to watch actually)ghosts", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent picture quality, includes night vision, eight cameras and 520 feet of cables", "Author": "Cute Chihuahua", "ReviewID": "R13HM4I6YZ5FH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I want to start out first by saying before you consider purchasing any security system I would be sure to think long and hard about what you want to accomplish with your system. How high of a resolution are you expecting out of the cameras? How many cameras do you really need? How much recording time do you need on your DVR? How much are you prepared to pay to have the system professionally installed or are you able to install the system on your own. If you are installing on your own you may want to compare the ease of wireless compared to wired cameras. If you have a single story home then running wires through your attic might be easier. If you have a larger two story home then and plan to have cameras both upstairs and downstairs like our house then installation is much more complicated.This security system comes with a 1 TB hard disk drive DVR, remote control, mouse, 8 security cameras and 65 foot of cable for each camera. This system has the ability to connect an additional 8 cameras but I am really not sure who would need 18 security cameras. Maybe a small business of some sort or someone that owns a mansion. I thought carefully about where to install my cameras and decided to install 5 of them on the first floor. I decided to go with the first floor for two reasons. The camera resolution is decent but you can see better when someone is within about 25 feet of the camera. If you go much further than that it gets blurry. These cameras will produce a decent picture but it can be a little fuzzy at times. It is good enough for the average home security system if you aren't expecting too much. If you are expecting HD picture or anything close you will not be happy. If you are expecting picture like that then you will have to substantially increase your security system budget. These cameras don't have the ability to pan or zoom but they do have built in night vision. Each camera has built-in infrared red LED lights that allow the cameras to see in the pitch black and nobody would even know the camera was there because you can't see the LED lights with your naked eye. Each camera comes with 65 foot of cable. If you are installing everything on the same floor then that might be enough but it may not be enough cord for your needs on a two story home. I will say that the cameras are pretty good quality. They are very strong and solid and much nicer than some of the others that I have seen. So far they have held up good to the weather and strong winds and the finish still looks nice on them.I am happy with my installation of the system but I really had to figure it out as I went along. There was a quick start guide the explained how to hook up the system and get it running but it gave no real instructions, guide or tips whatsoever on how to install the cameras other how to screw them into the wall. I think it would have been nice to have more detailed instructions. It comes with a mouse that you to select the camera viewing mode and change settings. For example you can view all eight cameras on the screen at the same time or you can pick one camera in particular and display it full screen. You can also set it to display each camera full screen but flip from one camera to the next. There are also various alarms and alerts that you can set up. You can tell the camera only to record when there is motion that it captures. Or you can tell it to alert you via email if there is movement detected on a particular camera. For example let's say you put a camera in a place where nobody should ever be at you could set the alert and it would notify you if movement was detected. It also has the ability to view your camera over the internet but I haven't got to use this option yet. It claims that you can view the video from any computer, tablet or smartphone but it doesn't give you an application or any directions on how to set up. Apparently you must use a third party app and configure it to work with this system. There are tons of menus with different settings. I know what some of the settings do but I have no idea about some of them as well. I think this system really needs a manual that will explain all the options in detail for those of us that aren't experts. Later I did find out that are some good videos on their website that would have been very helpful if I had knew about them upfront.Overall I consider this a very decent security system for the price. You get a large DVR, eight cameras with night vision, mouse and 520 total feet of cables. If you have a large house or a small business then having eight cameras might be nice but for the average home you probably won't need eight cameras. The good thing about this package is that I have a few cameras leftover as a backup. If one of the cameras would get damaged due to vandalism or extreme weather then I will easily be able to remove and replace the camera. The only thing that I was wish was different about this system is I wish that the cameras were wireless. That would make installation so much easier and give you more installation options. I am sure that would increase the cost but I think that would be a huge plus.", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "OK but be aware of other requirements", "Author": "Scott Hiddelston", "ReviewID": "R2LXKJFAJKLUR8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The other reviews have clearly stated the limitations of these systems, but I'd like to add a couple of requirements that may trip you up after installing. But first, my feelings on the system itself.If you purchase the 16-channel system, then the picture will be poor. The 16 channel DVR has no more processing power than the 8 channel, so with the 16 channel DVR the picture is half the quality. You will not be able to see faces clearly trust me. The cameras are well built, but their infra-red capabilities are poor. Expect to buy additional infra-red lighting if you are more than 30 feet away. Best to figure that out first so you don't have to run another set of wiring later on, and can do it at the same time as installing the cameras. The software works ok, but it was built for the Windows XP and earlier era, so it has a very un-intuitive look. It gets the job done though.But remote viewing (smartphone, laptop ) presents some real headaches when viewing away from your local network. First off, this system, despite assurances from the company, is not Mac friendly. You are going to have to set up port forwarding on your router or modem, and if you can't do that by yourself, the program offered costs $30 and only runs on a PC. And it does not support any Apple routers either, such as Airport Extreme/Base Station.  Additionally, Apple routers do not support a feature called DDNS, which you will need to have if your ISP only provides you with a Dynamic IP ( most do, and either charge extra or refuse to offer the simpler option, a static IP). This means basically if you have an Apple router you will have to buy a different one. However these requirements exist for every camera system, regardless of model or manufacturer, if you want remote viewing. A bit techy I know, but I had to learn these headaches  the hard way .In the end I returned this system, and purchased cameras, wires and a DVR as separates so I can upgrade each part if needed.

Standalone & hardwired with power over the same connection as the video.  DVR capability with decent resolution.  It is hardwired (no wireless signal noise to battle).  Affordably priced. Not a bad system overall.Cons: It is hardwired, so you have to be prepared to plan our your installation.  Cameras can only be mounted one way, and only after installing them do you realize that this is done to make the mounting extremely solid. The interface is clunky and looks like it was made 20 years ago and not touched. While each individual camera can record at an excellent frame rate and high resolution, the system AS A WHOLE is limited to ~240 frames per second.  The instructions are clunky and vagueNotes:This is clearly NOT a professional system, and you should be able to tell by the price.  You get what you pay for: a decent system that gets the job done if you are willing to put in the time to tweak the system a bit.  Going in to this understanding the limitations of a system of this price point will properly set your expectations (don't expect 1080p Movie quality for distances from your house to around the block, for example).The marketing material is entirely misleading and borderline false.  Sure, you can do the highest resolution.. a 1 frame per second if you have all of the cameras included.. but what use is that? If you only have 6 cameras connected, the other 2 unused cameras as still included in the calculation of the total number of frames per second.There are three resolutions:CIF - Crap  - 1 frame per second = 1 total frame per secondHD1 - A little better than crap  - 1 frame per second = 2 total frames per secondD1 - Not Bad  - 1 frame per second = 4 total frames per secondThe cameras will give you the detail you are looking for at home with 600 total lines of resolution per camera.  That's actually not bad.  But don't expect the recorded images to flow like your video camera or phone video as you will need to reduce the frame rate for each camera in order to support the higher resolutions. If you want all of your cameras at the best resolution (Under Record->Mainstream), you can see that you will have to adjust your cameras accordingly.  Remember, though, this is just for recording, not live viewing.Live viewing is always very grainy!Use the SwanView iPhone App not the ad-ridden Defender one!  Ads?  That is a straight up insult to their customers. I'd like to slap the guy who thought \"yeah, lets put ads on the app that we say is 'free' with the system that we made people fork over $$$ for.\"Read the other reviews here before wiring! I can't stress this one enough! One reviewer's notes made my installation a breeze by understanding that the cables can only go ONE way (not because of the video connector, but because of the power connector).  Maximum distance is ~165-180 feet, so you can get creative without drilling (you need to buy longer lengths of cable if you want to go that far).  I ran all of my cables out from my house in two distinct spots, then tucked the wiring under/behind the siding before finally drilling a 1/4\" hole through the siding only and mounting the camera over the hole.My three biggest issues are:1. The manual is near useless for USING the system.  If you don't have history in IT (I do), then trying to figure out all of the settings through the ancient clunky interface will make you want to pull your hair out and put your fist through the screen in just a few minutes.  NOTE: DO NOT put this directly outside of your firewall or configure your firewall to allow you to get to it from outside your network if you don't truly understand security.. unless of course you want someone else to get in to your camera system without your knowledge.  Ask a friend for help with this one!2. The interface is OLD and DILAPIDATED.  It looks like something running under Windows 3.1!  The only up-side here is that the entire system is really a \"set it once and never touch it again\" kind of system, so if you manage to make your way through the entire configuration to the point where you are ok with the results, you're done for a long time.3. Motion detection is spotty.  I especially like the one reviewer who included \"ghosts\" in what the motion detection picks up.  It's 100% true!

Had to return 1 camera for warranty coverage as the camera's live/recorded view was a bit blurry.  Still awaiting on the status of this camera.  Had no problems working with customer support to get it sent out to be verified.", "Date": "March 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "If only the wire would install themselves in the walls...", "Author": "Sharpfire13", "ReviewID": "R3PVESJKIXM5UY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera system is just what i was looking for. The quality is great for the price. The system is easy to configure once you get the wires run. I had alot of trouble with this because i have an old house with some plaster walls. I will need to purchase one wireless camera since i can not get cable to one of the areas that i would like to have a camera. The DVR is small and easy to hide. The cable is thin except for the ends which need to go through the wall. As another review suggested, it would be great to have small quick disconnects on the ends of the cable so that the size of the hole that needs to be drilled can be smaller. I has to atleast tripple the size of the existing hole that i had from an existing network camera which i cripmed the end on after putting the cable through the wall. So far i am happy with the system. Hopefully this system will last for a long time to come.", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Defender", "Author": "Bluerose's Heart \"Bluerose's Heart\"", "ReviewID": "RBSAMGHLL98TL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm going to ditto one of the other reviewers and say that when this system first arrived, it was so overwhelming that we placed all the boxes in a closet for several weeks. Once my husband started working with it, though, it was actually very simple(although a little time consuming) to set up.We're very pleased with the picture quality. It's by no means TV quality these days. Think maybe picture TV quality a couple of decades ago. We're still pleased, though! It feels great to have video footage of any creepers around our house. That's definitely a disadvantage of living in a secluded area! If someone decides to steal something off our back porch, or worse, we've got them on tape!While we're not professionals when it comes to security systems or anything, I think this is an awesome system to have, whether it's for a professional business or you just want to feel a little safer around your home. Plus, the price has came down several hundred dollars since I first got it. Definitely a bonus!!", "Date": "February 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Big Brother Is Watching", "Author": "JT", "ReviewID": "R3HCW2ZY4Q9HL8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I actually always wanted to get a security cam system for my home property.  Not so much to be big brother but rather just to have the comfort of knowing whatever random event that might happen is on tape such as robbery, slip-and-fall claim, ferris bueller parties while parents out of town, 2 hour mailman visit (j/k)....I'm really not too handy so I always pictured myself getting wireless security cam system but I've checked in on the reviews the past few years and didn't really notice any runaway best sellers with consistent glowing reviews.  So even though the Defender Pro is not wireless cams when the opportunity presented itself to utilize this unit it was a no brainer for me - plus just like wifi ultimately hardlines are always more consistently reliable than wireless.So not being too handy I only have two of the four cams up and running so far because they are in locations where less cabling required.  They feed into the DVR which is on my coat closet shelf.  I can then view the recorded feeds on the DVR by plugging my laptop into.  So basically although I'm not that techie a I do regularly hookup my DVD players, DVR's, laptop cables, etc so this Defender thus far has not proved too much more difficult than that other than feeding cam wires to the DVR.  I did watch the youtube instructions first (always recommended) though just to build my confidence and make sure I wasn't way off base on anything.From what I can tell this setup is high quality.  All the cams and components are nicely built.  The set comes with various screws, etc to help with setup so they didn't skimp there.  The playback on my laptop is good quality - daylight very good, night up close decent, night farther away not that good.  Also the DVR says it keeps 4 years of continuous tapes which is pretty amazing and probably several years more than I will ever need.What I also haven't done yet is get the remote viewing up and running.  To me this feature is a big part of the value of this type of security system - being able to check on your property via internet browser when you are out of town.  Now that I have basic two cams up I want to work on adding the other two cams then tackle the remote viewing setup (also youtube video instructions for that).So in conclusion thus far I'm impressed with what $650 buys you for this system so I give this product 5-stars.

I immediately re-crated it and sat for a while before deciding how to proceed. Finally, I looked online and found a guy who was advertising to install Christmas lights on people's homes. I figured if he could install Christmas lights he could install my security cameras. I was right. It took him a good couple of hours to get everything up and running, but I feel much more secure now that my Defender Security System is in place.I keep the main DVR in my office and it easily hooks up to my computer or TV. I am constantly concerned that someone is going to break into my house and have their way with me before dismembering and hiding my corpse, but anytime I start to worry I just look at my cameras to see if anyone is lurking. The other reviewers have listed all the technical aspects of this system, so I am going for the more practical. It seems to have a lot of recording capacity and the cameras produce clear, vivid images. Set-up was intimidating so I hired a pro. I am extremely happy I have the Defender Security Camera System.

The only thing I had a problem with was the template for drilling the holes for the camera mount. The holes are off. I figured it out on the first camera and made adjustments for the next three. We signed up for a DnyDNR site so I can view the camera feed over my Driod phone. Works great! I am planning on purchasing a couple more cameras later. The IR camera works very good at night. It takes some time to get the alarm settings just right. The first day it was up and running, I got probably about 60 email alerts. Now, it has calmed down.

I took the advice of a neighbor to get nothing less of 600 and its still grainy. You can't read a license plate number if you wanted to. You can barely make out a face. To identify a person, they would have to be up close to the camera. It's also impossible for me to access footage from the Internet cause you have to hook up the DVR to the modem. My modem is located in my office  upstairs. There is no way for me to wire the system all the way up to the second floor of my house when most of my cameras are set up by the font door, garage and around the side of the house. Therefore my system is located in the garage. The wiring is not difficult at all. It's pretty easy to hook up. They provided a lot of cable, but for me, because of the layout of my house, it was impossible to hook it up to my modem. I would've had to buy more cable and had cable visible all over the place, which I was not willing to do. The DVR can pick up my wireless but cannot connect, which makes the internet option for me useless. Honestly, I wish i had purchased the wireless system instead. With this system you are limited to where you can install the cameras.  Definitely consider where you're going to house the system and if it's anywhere near the modem. Nice thing is, the cameras are visible from the street and I'm hoping it will deter thieves from hitting our house.", "Date": "March 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "High quality, well priced item.", "Author": "error", "ReviewID": "R3USD6GKY10R7U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm overall pleased with this unit in terms of cost, quality, and functionality.  It took me a good month to get through a lot of testing/tweaking and trying to understand the pros/cons of the unit and here's what I have experience thus far:Pros:-I'm no handyman.  However, after 2-3 days of continuous setup and effort with some help I was able to actually set everything up: cameras in position, wires hooked up, setting checked, PC hooked up, and so forth.  This may seem like a long time, but I personally believe it's pretty quick for all the planning and work I did in order to set-up a good security/monitoring system.  Remember, the payoff comes later for all the hard-work.-EXTREMELY good daylight quality and the night-time quality is very good as long as the individual is close.  From far-away things look like blobs.-Easy to use settings and software.-Remote viewing capabilities.  I have not had the need to utilize them yet, but the option is obviously extremely nice to have for security reasons.  I will update ASAP regarding this specific functionality.Cons:-It takes a long time to plan everything out.  This is HIGHLY specific to your building/territory and needs.  You MUST account for blind spots (i.e. where cameras won't be able to see either due to trees/corners or due to their positioning), bright spots (i.e. sun shining right into the lens or reflecting off of a vehicle), and finally distance from intended monitoring range (the farther away, the worse the quality).  This isn't so much a con of this system specifically, but you must take all this planning into account or your cameras will be worthless.Overall, I recommend this unit for it's quality, flexibility, and remote viewing capability.  The only thing I can compare this system to is an X10 system I used to have which WAS HORRIBLE!!! If you're not going to get this unit, then please, at least do not getting anything X10.  You get what you pay for and I frankly think the x10 items are overpriced.

The remote control allows for advanced functions that will give you an amazing flexibility.The only con I find here is the installation work.
