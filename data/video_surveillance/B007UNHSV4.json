{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Wonderful video monitor!", "Author": "Blessed mommy of 3", "ReviewID": "R221ZAE1P0PF8J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been browsing monitors for months and decided against buying a video monitor. I found this at Costco for a great price and figured I had nothing to lose since Costco has an amazing return policy. I have only used this monitor for 2 days so I cannot speak yet to its longevity, but so far I absolutely love it. Crisp and clear color picture during the day and a good quality black/white night vision picture. The 2 way talk works great. I have no problems with volume level. Can hear well through monitor. Going to buy an additional camera for the kids playroom. I'm glad I found this system. Don't hesitate to buy.**update**Have used this now for a couple months. Love it. It works wonderful. Having never used a video monitor before the thing I dislike is how you either have to have it on all night or sleep mode. In sleep mode it wakes up when the baby cries. This is good, but I really would prefer to hear every snort, wiggle, and sneeze.. This may be with all video monitors though.  Also the little blue power light is overwhelmingly bright on both units. It actually lit up the crib. I just covered it up with tape. No big deal.Very pleased with monitor. I added a pic to show how great the night quality is.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "AWESOME!", "Author": "Michelle Dunder", "ReviewID": "R3O09PJ99649RJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This monitor is amazing. The night vision works very well. There are lullabies & you can intercom to the camera & talk to your baby.  And after baby is older, you can totally use this as a security camera! You can link up to 4 cameras too.  Worth every penny.The only down side is if you want an additional camera, they are hard to find & sell for $100.", "Date": "October 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Had a couple hiccups, but otherwise GREAT product!", "Author": "shadarap", "ReviewID": "R2I2M2M03TZ106", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have bought 3 of these units, 2 for us and 1 as a gift.  The feature set is great, and the units are incredibly easy to use.  We did have 2 problems with 2 different units, but the problem was rectified IMMEDIATELY with Uniden support.Even though there were 2 issues with 2 different units I am still rating this product 5 stars because I'm assuming, and giving the benefit of the doubt, that they were both from a bad batch, and because their customer service went above and beyond to resolve the problems.  My siblings also have this product, going on a couple years, and have had zero issues.", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "horrible sound", "Author": "Megan Crowley", "ReviewID": "R1PNWTLR3MMMW1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Even with the volume cranked all the way up I can barely hear what my child is saying.  I hear more with the monitor off!!  The picture is good quality. The camera is on a very heavy base which makes placement difficult.  Also it needs a zoom and pan feature for camera.", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Almost unreachable customer service, for one", "Author": "T. Baca", "ReviewID": "R22AO8ELJZG0YJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received this video baby monitor about 4 months ago as a brand-new gift from a very good friend.  Since it was free for me, I am giving a review not based at all on price.  Unfortunately I haven't successfully gotten it to work either, so cannot review a functioning unit.I opened it up a couple of days ago (hadn't needed to use it prior), and the video screen unit does not work.  No green light when charging (there is an indicator but it does not light up), nothing.  Long story short, after switching batteries in the camera and monitor (they are the same voltage and therefore interchangeable, though one provides more 'juice' for the hungrier monitor), I successfully charged them both (they both power up the camera), and successfullly diagnosed the monitor as a dud.  OK, duds happen.  Minus 1/2 star for a dud with a sticker that reads 'quality control verified' or somesuch nonsense on the back.Now for the warranty.  The booklet describes a One year warranty, but that has a \"Cancel\" stamp across it.  Another small sheet describing the 90 day warranty is apparently the policy now.  Minus a full star for not supporting an electronic device beyond 90 days.  I would never buy it with that knowledge (unless I wanted to throw it away after the warranty - and it would have to be dirt cheap), it generally means you're producing near-future duds.Customer service - being outside the product warranty, I called them anyway, knowing that a decent customer service staff will make reasonable concessions to their own policies to avoid losing future customers.  I was able to reach them after holding for 15 minutes the first day.  The rep asked if I had charged both devices a full 16 hours and I told her no, only 30 minutes.  She instructed me to do that, and then call back if there was a problem.  I hung up, and a few seconds later realized that the video monitor's charge light had never come on when I plugged it into charge.  Oh well, phone call/wait time essentially wasted.  I did 'charge' it anyway for 16 hours at that point.The next 2 times I called customer service, the first time I gave up after holding for 20mins, and the second time I reached them after holding for 50 (FIFTY) minutes - interspersed with the usual 'blah blah your time is very important to us' garbage every few seconds.  Minus a full star for having to wait an average of 30+ minutes to speak to a customer rep.  Unfortunately for them, 'very' has more weight in my dictionary than theirs, so I happen to strongly disagree with that statement, and this gives them minus 1/2 star.They did not make a concession to their own policy, and offered me to send it in to fix for $62; add shipping, and that's well over 1/2 the current Amazon price of the item new, for something that's guaranteed to not break for 90 days.  Well that's reassuring.A slight minus for non-standard batteries.  I would prefer AA or AAA Eneloops any day over something of unknown quality that I have to special order (companies take heed!).  No star deduction there.  I can be fair.Another slight minus.  \"Quality video\" - it is something like 240x320 resolution, or 0.08 megapixel - far from quality in 2013 or 2010.  Perhaps quality in 1950.  I'll be fair and not deduct any stars, since I haven't actually seen the video in action.So starting with a 4-star review for a neat-concept, decently-implemented product, then subtracting my 2 stars as above is how I came up with the rating.  Note that the 'slight minuses' did not factor into the actual rating, but are not inconsistent with it.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Power button broke", "Author": "engrinchicago", "ReviewID": "R20XMUQD8TFDCI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had this about six months.  The same frequency is used for some RC toys we like to play with.  The act of turning the camera on and off caused the power switch to break. By that I mean the plastic bit on the outside is fine, but the electronic component on the inside that has a plastic nub that fits in the outer slider just sheared off.  That's $150 for six months of use..find another camera!", "Date": "November 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor Microphone", "Author": "Silent Running", "ReviewID": "R2GTN6965JD1S8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I agree with the previous post regarding volume. We had the same experience, I could hear Grandma reading a bedtime story better through a closed door 20 feet away than through the receiver's speaker. We bought 2 of these to use in different rooms, not through Amazon, but at a membership club where returns are not a problem.  Good thing too, because the second one is no different.  The other thing you need to be aware of is the color accuracy, if that's important to you.  I assume there's no infrared filter because greens are dark grey, red is light grey, grey is green, at least white is kind of white.The lack of adequate volume is the kicker though, I need it to wake me when the baby cries, there's no leeway there.
