Packing could have been better. Both camera boxes were easily able to move around within their packing.My first 2 cameras arrived in excellent cosmetic condition but one of the cameras had something loose inside that rattled when the camera was moved from side-to-side. I connected both cameras and they appeared to work well but I didn't want to take a chance with something shorting out inside the 'damaged' camera. I called Foscam and got a lackluster customer service person which suggested I send my camera to Foscam for repair. I could not get any timeframe as to how long the repair might take so I decided on a different route. Thankfully, Amazon immediately issued a return label but I did have to order another replacement on my dime. Amazon will credit me when they receive the damaged camera.Replacement camera arrived the next day, thanks to Amazon's expedited shipping. I quickly connected the camera and all seemed well until I tried to connect the camera via wifi. This camera appeared to have some major issue picking up any local wifi signals, and would only pick up a signal from my router if it was 5 feet from the camera. After some troubleshooting I determined that this camera was damaged, too. Again, Amazon issued a return label but I again had to order a replacement on my dime.Second replacement camera arrived the next day and I again immediately connected and setup the camera and was able to obtain great video via RJ45 and wifi. This camera was able to pick up the signal of various local wifi networks that are available in my area. Whew! finally! I have 2 working cameras.So, what have we learned here? This experience could have been a real nightmare if I would have ordered from Foscam's website directly as they would have required the damaged cameras to be sent back for repairs. From what I have read via other Amazon members and a few online sites, this can take a while and in the meantime, you're without a camera or your cash. A big kudos, a giant thumbs-up to Amazon for making this whole experience manageable. Although I did have to fork over some major bucks for the replacements, I know I will receive a refund within a few days. If you do order this camera, order from a vendor that has an exceptional return/exchange policy, you may need it.As for the camera itself... the performance is pretty darn good. Video on the working cameras I have is nice and sharp, even during low-light or night time viewing. The field of view is decent at 54 degrees, although I wish it was a little wider, maybe about 70 degrees. The camera's web server GUI is pretty nice and straightforward. It offers a bit of flexibility in mirroring and flipping the image and adjusting the displayed colors. Overall construction also appears to be pretty sturdy. The biggest fault, in my opinion, is the camera's mounting bracket. It should have been beefier and offer and a more solid angle adjustment.If you're lucky enough to get a working camera, I think you would be satisfied with the performance.", "Date": "June 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Will Not send email alerts on Motion Detection", "Author": "Kao", "ReviewID": "R3SU8W1O9BPXT1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I only bought this camera just because I had good experience with their indoor one.This camera should not be put in to production.

My previous experience with cameras has left me somewhat skeptical about other mfg's claims for their products. The daylight pictures are sharp and clear with great color, the night time pictures are black and white, but they are clear enough to recognize a persons face at least 30 feet away. This camera plus the Blue Iris operational software makes a heck of a package.And the great customer service! I had the camera up and working in no time but then tried to set it up on a different computer with out internet access (which was not needed). Messed something up, fought it for over two days without success. Finally broke down and called Foscam customer support. Should have done it immediately! Had to wait about 45 minutes listening to really weird music but it was well worth it.The rep's microphone (and accent) made it kinda difficult for me (and him 'cause I kept asking him to repeat himself). But, Boy! Did he blow thru the remote fixing procedure! He definitely knew what he was doing. Really neat to watch him. I noticed that he used the Foscam software just to set up the camera and then used the Blue Iris software to configure and test it. When he was finished he magically deposited me and my screen here in Amazon and helped me get this review started. Wow, what service!?Following day edit:Well, that was on Friday and I got too enthusiastic while writing the above narrative because after the tech guy (Calvin) finished with the \"fixing\" he immediately put my screen here (remotely) and pushed me hard to write a \"Terrific\" review with a \"Terrific\" title, even though I had purchased the camera directly from Foscam, not on Amazon. He kept re-assuring me that everything was okay and working. I wrote the title with his direction and thinking everything was okay, finished with the rest of it.However, I wasn't given a chance to unplug the hardwired cable he had used to configure the camera until after I finished the review and he had left. I then unplugged the cable to let the camera run wirelessly. But guess what! It still wouldn't work in wireless mode. So I was back to square one and mightily p****d off!By then it was almost 4:30pm but I thought maybe I could still get someone at customer service. So I sat on hold on the phone for over an hour and when finally got a human it was just after 6:00pm. She wouldn't help but took my phone number and said they would call me. And they did. The next day (Saturday) a guy (that I could understand) called (from India) and we started again to try to resolve the problem. After working very patiently for an hour and a half and trying out different routers plus downloading a firmware update to make sure those weren't the problem, he declared that there was an issue with the wireless mode. I was glad to find out that I hadn't messed up anything. He gave me instructions on how to get an RMA label to replace the camera. I'll do that and we'll see what happens next.I saw that the first guy could access these reviews with no trouble (somehow right into my account!)(kinda scary, huh?), so if they don't delete or edit this review, I'll come back and let you all know what happens next.I still like the camera (a lot), and Blue Iris software. The camera's pictures and videos are sharp and clear, just like I said above. BI is really nice to use. All kinds of options and really informative help screens.Week and a half later:Well, I received the replacement camera in a timely manner, but still could not get it to work on wireless. I didn't think that figuring out port settings would be too difficult. Wrong!! I worked on it for two more days and got absolutely no where. Much frustration, stress, etc. Remembering my previous experience with \"Technical Service\", I wasn't in much of a rush to call in.Finally just happened to find out that a new friend was a local \"IT\" and when he offered to help, I jumped at the chance. He is now my new Best Friend!! Took him about 45 minutes to get this puppy up and running just like it's supposed to. He discovered that the last Tech guy had configured the camera to work off of my main router and computer instead of off the isolated little camera network I had setup for it (and hadn't even done that right!). I guess it was just easier for him to do that instead of doing as I had insisted he do. I had to tell him several times that I did not want this camera to be recording on my main computer and router and finally was yelling to make him understand I was dead serious!But, he did it his way anyway.The camera seems to be really good and now that I've found local Tech Support, I'm probably going to get another one. I read the reviews that praised the Tech Support (from India) and that's one of the main reasons I bought the camera in the first place, but since this review completely disappeared from the Amazon listing shortly after it went negative (found it had been moved over to the listing for a different camera (FI8904), so I copied it to here), plus being pushed so hard by the tech guy in India to write a review) I have begun to be suspicious of them. Maybe all good product reviews are done that way, who knows?? Anyway, I thought I'd finish it just to see what happens next.If you have a choice, I strongly recommend you try hard to find a local IT person that has experience with cameras before you subject yourself to the stress of doing it the way I did.

Loftus \"blueOrbit\"", "ReviewID": "R10YRZLJIR3ET", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have (4) Foscam cameras in total and I like them for their relative simplicity, adaptability, compatibility, and affordability.  This was my first foray into one of their outdoor models.  Setup was a breeze, as always.  The pictures quality is fantastic, and the structural build quality is sound.The issue, and the 1 star rating, has to do with stability / reliability.  The camera requires almost a daily power cycle / reboot.  This makes it a poor choice as a security camera since the whole idea is for the camera to be installed as a setup-and-forget... when it sees something, it can send you a message.  That doesn't work when the camera firmware causes it to freeze or lock-up.  I'm not actually sure what happens, but it simply becomes impossible to connect to the camera.  The only way that I've found to recover, is to pull the plug.  Since I have this camera setup at a distant vacation home where I don't have the ability to simply pull the plug, this renders it completely useless.  The camera is placed under an eve, in constant shade, in a climate that varies from 30 to 70 degrees during the summer (high mountains).  It's never even exposed to moisture.If Foscam implemented some sort of option in the firmware to have the camera auto reboot every X number of hours, then I could give it 3 stars, but as is usually the case with Foscam, they don't invest a lot of time in supporting their products... otherwise they would have released a firmware update so that it doesn't lock-up at all.I'm really disappointed that such a potentially great product has such a horrible defect.

I bought 2 for my home and they actually worked for a bit.. was so happy with them that I setup a friend with 8 of them whom I talked highly of them to.

I had read the negative reviews here, but still bought this camera because I have had pretty good experiences with the other foscam cameras I own so I figured it might just be the reviewers not understanding how it works.I bought this camera to replace 2 8905W cameras I have and like.  I wanted a wider camera angle and to be able to set the motion detection area.  Both of those features were available with the 9802w and not the 8905w.  I only bought 1 instead of 2 up front in case these reviews were accurate.  it turns out they were.  This is a terrible product for what I wanted to use it for.Pros1. Wider camera angle than most of these cameras2. high-def, although you can't really use the high-def over wireless from outside of location.  the performance is bad, even over cable modem.  The VGA mode works fine3. Being able to select your motion detection area.  Reduces false alerts by 200% in my case.Cons -1. I could connect to the camera via it's http interface once or twice, then never without rebooting it.  I enter the password.  It spins, then comes back to login.2. The motion alarm is broken.  The first alarm it sent me was a picture of my wife taking the recycle bin out.  That is the same 3 pictures it sends me over and over again on any alert.  I have to assume that it is something real/live triggering the alert, but I just get the same 3 pictures that are now 4 days old.  It makes the camera utterly useless for me.4. If you try to update this firmware, like some other foscam cameras, you will loose the camera.  It will make it unresponsive and you will have to return it.So in conclusion, if you don't care about the motion email alerts and you don't try to upgrade the firmware you could be happy with this.  I have to think that this is an entirely different team working on this software for this camera compared to the previous camera models.  The older cameras software just worked.

I have only had it running for a couple days now and it seems to record on motion and send alarms to my phone without any issues.  Cannot comment on the default software as Blue Iris is all I use. I was concerned on first run as the image was very washed out but a little research showed to change the mode in the web interface using internet explorer to Outdoor.

I bought 2 new HD 720 Foscams (FI9802W and FI9821). Both are garbage. The FI9821W wouldn't allow me to access the menu. The default password didn't work! I tried factory reset, powering off/on the unit with no luck. The FI9802W wasn't much better. I was able to connect to the new camera and configure but the quality was pretty poor.

The IR and color settings were terrible and while you can adjust these settings, I couldn't get an image that compared to the older models I have. I'm sure Foscam will get it right eventually but it's very unfortunate that they don't care at all about the quality of the product. What's worse, I didn't realize that most of the positive ratings were all fake and done by a company that does this for them.
