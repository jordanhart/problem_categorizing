{"Reviews": [{"Title": "You can program this key pad", "Author": "dellyjoe", "ReviewID": "REN4EORCK85OO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this keypad to save money and then found out you need a 6160 alpha display for easy programming.  If you get a 6150 and don't want to return it or buy a 6160, it is possible to program basic functions with the 6150.  For example, if you want to arm your system using the # key.  First enter the installer code 4112 800. A 20 will appear which indicates you are in the data field programming mode. Enter *21 and then 1 This enables quick arming.  Then enter *99 which is the code to exit programming.  If you bought the Vista 10P as I did to replace an old radio shack hard wire control panel (lightning took mine out), it will do the job with no programming.  Six resistors come with the  10P and need to be put in the loop for normally closed zone (cut one wire and patch it with a resistor) and across the loop (strip but do not cut wires incoming and outgoing and place a resistor between the sides) for normally opened zone.  This turns your system into an EOL (end of line resistor) type.  The default for the Vista 10P is six EOL zones, so you are back in business without any complicated programming or expense.  In short, if you have taken a shot at fixing your old radio shack system the Vista 10P  and Ademco 6150 keypad will do it quite simply.  Use the default setup and you can skip the incredibly complex programming hassles \"progress\" has caused.  This information is in the Vista 10P manual, but hard to find due to all the other details.", "Date": "July 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "DID NOT WORK", "Author": "Jennifer McCall", "ReviewID": "R3060R0NJ1I49I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have never written a feedback for any item on Amazon.  But I am writing because of this product and \"Home Security 4 DIY's\" unwillingness to return a faulty piece of equipment.  The item would not display, it would not move into \"Programming mode\" and displayed incorrect power status.  Based on Amazons great return policy, I purchased this a couple of months prior to installation.  When it failed, I attempted to return.  \"Home Security for DIY's\" told me they would not return....so much for a great return policy.

The keypad addresses on the old 6128 were set at the default address of 31. Since the new 6150 are also set at a default address of 31 the switch was easy. Turn off the system, cut, strip install the four wires as shown in the supplied instructions.  The 6150 screw mounting holes even matched the 6128 holes in the wall. Turn the system back on and clear any codes. OC code is an open circuit. Check the wiring. Make sure the green and yellow wires are hooked up and not reversed.

My husband was hesitant in ordering the keypad, due to some negative reviews.  However, he stated that that the good outweighed the bad and ignored the negative reviews.  He ordered two Honeywell, Ademco 6150 keypads to replace our old ones. Also, the best price we found was through Amazon.The directions were very easy to understand.  Within one hour he, replaced and installed both of our 26 year old Honeywell keypads.  The new keypads are much larger than our previous ones; and much easier to read numbers and words in the dark, due to the sufficient amount of lighting.It has been two months since the installation of the Admeco Keypads, and suffice it to say we are exceptionally happy with this product.
