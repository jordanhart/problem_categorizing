{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Second Camera system from Aposonic. - different homes - different locations!!  A+++++", "Author": "LE \"freespirit\"", "ReviewID": "R54KUJ28KEBK0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the 2nd camera system we have ordered from Aposonic.First one is a (8) camera system for our 2nd home (vacation home) have had now for over 2 years without a single problem.  Can view remotely, and the system emails snapshots of all movement.  Aposonic A-BR22B8-G1TB which also Amazon does carry.The 2nd system is this Aposonic A=S040R1E and while only a 4 camera system it seems to work just fine.There are some features in the settings of camera and adminatration that I prefer on the 8 camera system that the 4 channel does not have but then again visa versa on the 4 channel to the 8 channel.  If you are considering a security system from Aposonic wisit their company website and check out each model and look at the instruction manuals to see if the system will have all the features that you are looking for in the adminstration of the DVR itself but on local network and remote network.Aposinic tech support and customer service has allways been top notch!  It might take a little bit to get set up to view remotely but that does not have to do with the DVR it will be in how easy it is to open up the ports on your router.  The email set up also can be a bit tricky but once you find the proper email settings for your email provider it works as it should.  Aposonic tech support will help you each step of the way.  It is wise though to have your instruction manual for your router and your email server settings handy should you need to call Aposonic fo r assistance.  This will speed up the process in them assisting you.I would not hesitate to purchase another security system from this company and have already had some of my family members purchase who also have been very pleased.  As far as I can tell they sell good qualify for the price range.  Please note this brand \"Aposonic\" has only been the brand of security systems we have ever tried so I cannot compare to a different brand.We  felt that since the first worked so well for us that we only looked again at Aposonic for our 2nd home.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good, but I wish it would just work with iPhones without the rigamaroo.", "Author": "John Davidson \"Magic Feather\"", "ReviewID": "R1QC9R9T71JTJC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's a nice update to our Swann system.
