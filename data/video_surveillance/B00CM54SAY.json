I thought it would be a good idea to get video camera to set up in the windows to record movement while I wasn't home.  I tried the Uniden system that I bought at Walmart.  While it is good for viewing and watching while turned on, with the included screen monitor, it wasn't easy to set up to record on the different sensitivity levels.  You either recorded EVERYTHING for the allotted time, or very little.  And I couldn't see anything  that happened until I was home and reviewed recordings, such as they were.  I now use it as a monitor for when my grandchild is over and supposed to be sleeping.I tried the Trivision NC 213WF, a higher end camera and was most interested in the wireless feature.  I liked the promised ability to be able to view goings on while away from home.  Below I've listed my findings on this camera.*The set up was easy, as long as you follow the included instruction guide.  I wouldn't recommend just trying to plug in and expect results.  Read the guide and follow the steps for the results you want.  They are very clear.*The \"AnyScene\" app has to be downloaded and the camera synced to it so you can view remotely.  This was a bit of a process for the wireless to pick up and accept.  Follow the guide exactly and you won't mess it up.*Once the app is downloaded and your wireless accepts it, you can move the camera anywhere and plug it in.*I tested out how far I would be able to view remotely.  I work 10 miles from home and can check from work and see what's going on.  And I can clearly see the dog get on the couch or the cat moving around.  I really like this.  This works because of WIFI at home and work.* You can set up all different ways to record and set the time to show and date.  I really liked that.  Very easy.  And the night vision was nice, as long as you turn off the LED.  I have this camera placed right up to a window and if you don't turn the LED off, you will see nothing.*You can save images to a memory card or to record straight to your computer.  Whatever is your preference.  Very easy.*I did notice for the app, that it will crash.  Not every time, but often enough to warrant mentioning.  I did also notice that if this camera is moved from one location to another, the app will crash a few times and the camera will show up as \"off line\" .  It has to be turned off and on a few times to get it to work.  I've even had to shut my phone completely off a few times and turn it on to work.  But that is the app.  Not the camera.  I have checked on my computer and it shows online, when the phone app doesn't.*The picture is on this camera is so clear it's like HD TV!  Even in night vision.  I would recommend this camera to anyone.Overall, I've been very pleased.  Only drawback is the crashing app.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "I like it", "Author": "ww", "ReviewID": "R3SA4KMWOOAY30", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this camera as a dog monitor. The picture is in color and very clear. The sound quality is surprisingly good. The night vision is really clear too. I have tried using it to view outside and whilst great in the day the night vision is a bit compromised with the reflection of the LED lights. But it's an indoor camera so no moans.The wireless setup was painless through my Netgear router. I'm not a technical idiot but certainly not a genius. I just followed the instructions and I was up and running in a couple of minutes.I had some trouble setting up the email alerts and after help from support I simply created a gmail address and mirrored the settings on their help document and it worked immediately. I found the support team to be helpful and responsive.Having the iPhone app is reason I bought this in the first place. It is simple to setup and provides excellent images and sound via wifi or 3G. It also works on the iPad although the image when x2 is a little grainy.By the way, the updated app \"Anyscene\" works perfectly on my iPhone and iPad.

It says to download \"Anyscene\" from the app store. Tried that. Search of app store turns up nothing. I googled their website. Nothing there. Does not look like a working site. I have not yet tried installing via PC. Hope that works. But iPad install? No way.Okay turns out Anyscene is an iPhone only app so I finally downloaded it and was able to get camera working. Most features require a firmware update so will still need to use a PC. Their website has no support. I did not try emailing.I am holding at 1 star. I have four cameras working now but \"live view\" on the Apple app is poor. Biggest problem is that new camera right out of the box requires firmware update for any of the advanced features. Cannot even set date and time without it. I have read the 59 page user's manual on the CD that came in the box. No instructions on how to update the firmware except to contact their web site which doesn't exist. I tried browsing the CD through the software setup with no success. So as a basic camera, it works.

This \"wireless\" device seems to require a direct ethernet cable connection to a router.  After figuring all of THAT out, additional firmware must be downloaded to make the thing work properly.
