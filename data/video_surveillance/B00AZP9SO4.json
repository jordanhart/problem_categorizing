{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good cameras", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R4R0GAY4FC5NF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased 3 of this model last year and have 3 of the standard exterior cameras from Q-See as well.  I'm not sure what the other reviewer here is upset about with the mounting of the camera.  There are some set screws that require an allen wrench to adjust but there's plenty of adjustment available.  Possibly the other reviewer didn't notice and missed how to adjust them but we had no problems.  Have one mounted 18' up on a telephone pole and was able to adjust it no problem.  We have 23 total cameras deployed, all from Q-See.  While the video is never as sharp as you'd like they are reliable and we're pleased. This model, the Extreme Weather Low Temp model, works very well in the winters here and we've been very happy with them.  The other \"regular\" exterior cameras occasionally fog when the temperature changes from 70's during the day to 20's at night during high humidity days which it often does here - so if you're looking for an outdoor camera, for the price, these are tough to beat.  Hope that helps some of you.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Garbage", "Author": "NoBS", "ReviewID": "R35X2YWI2GX7KE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to replace a similar Q-See camera that failed. This was supposed to be an upgrade. I won't discuss the stupidity of the feeble manual or what it takes to adjust the camera for idyllic situations, while needing a second person to view the monitor (I hope you  have two cell phones, walkie-talkies or can yell loud), but I will share things of more importance. The engineer(s) who thought they were smarter than the last one(s), is a reflection of why garbage like this is what we end up having to buy these days. This new and not improved camera hardware does not allow any reasonable tilt, so if you mount it high enough so some criminal can't get to it, it will film the building or home down the street, instead of your property; I'm only talking about 8 feet up the wall. I had to add 1/2\" wedges to the top back just to see to the edge of my driveway and if my driveway tilted into a street I would have needed more wedging. Fortunately, my driveway and drive are flat and I need to see just beyond my driveway. These imbeciles decided that form was more important than function and the poor design reflects in this product. If you want to record anything above ground level, you best mount it at the same level you want to film, or do some major modifications as I had to do. These designers make it even worse: If you want to replace the older model, be prepared to take the new unit in to be modified, have the tools to do-it-yourself and/or cut a hole in the wall and rerun all your wiring. Now, you must use the whole new assembly together as one piece as the wiring redesign has made it all but impossible to do otherwise. These morons even used the old hardware to frustrate you, yet used plastic plugs to shore up, both the camera housing and the cradle assembly to camouflage the old intelligent design, but did not give us the option to adapt it for our needs or the previous wiring.I will look elsewhere for my security requirements in the future as these guys have made this less user friendly. Backwards compatibility used to mean something.
