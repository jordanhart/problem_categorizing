The device constantly gives false alarms (on both motion detect only, and on sound detect only).  I spend hours and days looking for the right device that had infra red, motion detection, and email alert.  The product info said that this device had those functions, so after long deliberation, I bought the 2 pack.  I set them up, and then began the constant parade of false alarm emails to check.  Yes, I know there is a sensitivity slider that can be used, but it does not work to fix the problem.  You end up making the settings too insensitive, and you are essentially not getting any alarms when you should be.  HERE IS WHY SOUND DETECT DOES NOT WORK - The IR led's come on and off to compensate for ambient lighting.  When the IR led's change state, there must be by a mechanical switch, because you hear a click in the device.  The sound detect hears the click and sends an alarm email.  So, if you have windows, every time a cloud passes over and darkens, the ambient light, you get a click, a sound detect, and an alarm email in your inbox.  HUNDREDS OF FALSE ALARMS PER WEEK.  HERE IS WHY MOTION DETECT DOES NOT WORK - a change in light intensity triggers the motion alarm.  So, if you have windows, every time a cloud passes over and darkens, the motion detect is triggered and you get a false alarm email.

So, about a year ago - on a whim - I bought two of these.  They are mounted outside (under awnings/patio) - and the weather hasn't killed them yet.  You have to keep them dry - but I've ran them in temps in the NW from as low as -5 up to 100 degrees over the past year.  Since they've passed the test of time - I bought two more.  The other nice thing is they are easy to set up, have a great app to use with them, you can hear and talk through them, move the camera around remotely - and set them up to send you e-mail pictures of motion events that are better quality than my QSEE DVR sent.  The only downside to these:  They do not record video unless you've got the software on your computer at that location running.HOWEVER, Foscam does have more expensive units that DO have a micro SD card for recording video.

Jozsa", "ReviewID": "R3MFX3P0PA2WD6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "These cameras are great! Use them for indoor, as they have a good, wide angle and can record sound as well. Now, the video quality isn't the best...and there is better, but be careful and READ REVIEWS! The next model up, while the video is better, is not a great camera. There is a more narrow field of view (making it hard to use in smaller rooms around the house), it will use more bandwidth and the audio is very choppy and delayed. You've been warned! These camera's get the job done. Now, I will be buying better cameras for outdoor around the access points for my house (looking at 2-3 720p zoom, pan, tilt outdoor cameras), but these are great indoors to save wireless bandwidth, and honestly you can see as much detail as you need. I am using a Synology Diskstation for my surveillance software, and it has been great!Edit: Unfortunately, one of the cameras died shortly after my original review. Because I have something else to compare with; the Sharx Security indoor 2900 camera with 1080p, local DVR MicroSD recording and local NAS Synology storage/recording at the same time with MUCH better night vision, I'm going to have to edit my original rating. The Sharx cameras just really feature so much more, they have a better viewing angle, less of a footprint (more stealthy) and the video stream is extremely smooth even for the 1080p stream...but then again, they're also much more expensive. The Foscams, when working, are great cameras on a budget and have a decent field of view (angle).

I have one camera facing on the side of my house that can see the neighbors driveway. The camera will start recording but after the car has passed and the car would be going 5 mph or less. These cameras are decent for its price. If someone was to break in the house, the burglars would probally see the camera and bail or they will stay long enough for the camera to record. So far I just find the motion detector a bit delayed about 1-2 secs.

I ordered the first two as this package with the 9dbi antenna. I found the longer antenna really helped when I put one camera really far from my router (with about four walls and two floors in between)  I did a considerable amount of research prior to purchasing this and found it provided capabilities better than cameras costing hundreds more.My criteria was I needed something 100% reliable that I could access from anywhere in the world with a web browser. (I have had no issues with the cameras dropping off line due to network issues. They have excellent reliability so I can be gone for an extended period of time and still monitor my home.)I needed a camera that did not use much internet bandwidth (this camera achieves that by only using bandwidth when you actually are asking it to send video plus you can record video locally without using outside bandwidth.)Good night vision.I needed something that could sense motion and/or sound and send me photos of the activity.I didn't want to upgrade my home network. I have a 12 year old wireless router. All three cameras work quite well and even work with my old G wireless router even when all three are sending video at once and someone else is using our network as well.  I have a lot of wireless devices so I was really pleased that these cameras still worked flawlessly and I noticed no problems with the other devices or the cameras.The last nice thing is the setup was easy. I set it up using the CD (no issue there) and with DDNS but found I didn't really need to use that at all. The fact the camera will send me an email if my IP should change covers that.
