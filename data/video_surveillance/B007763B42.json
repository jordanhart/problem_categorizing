I like to think of myself as intelligent. As I do not really feel like dropping oodles of cash on a REAL whole house surveillance system I figured these decals might deter any potential morons from attempting a break in. When I received these stickers I was impressed by the quality of them. I have put them next to the existing security companies decals on my home (a real monitoring company)and they look very legit. I'm thinking I might purchase four fake security cameras as well with blinking LED light (I believe the package is about $25 on amazon from the same vendor - looks like there are solid reviews on those as well).I would recommend this inexpensive piece of mind - not really much that can be lost with this purchase.", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Faded", "Author": "cora jameson", "ReviewID": "R2VTWMVIK58O7Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The big sign is ok but the little stickers faded very fast I had to purchase new one's.
