JUST TELL ME MORE INFO!", "Author": "Daziegrl4", "ReviewID": "RWFP4T23DWHXK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this Security DVR however I got it from Warehouse Deals which the agents have just begun telling me about. I needed some instruction as to how to use this device as most people do when buying an electronic device that can be quite difficult to use if you are not that good with devices such as this. When I called to get help Defender has this pre-recored tape that always says their call volumes are higher than normal and that I should send them an Email and they will get back to me within 24 to 48 hours. I have yet to hear from them.Amazon only tells you that items you get from here are PERFEC! it is just that someone got it and returned it for some reason. I had no clue that some companies may or my not warranty these items. I was not told this at any point when they began selling me things from Amazon Warehouse deals. I always buy a Squaretrade warranty with any electronics I buy anyway but I do still expect the manufacturers warranty to still be in effect and to also be able to get technical support when I need it from whatever company that manufactures the product. I was never told any different so I just trusted Amazon to back me up on that belief. However, there may be somewhere that it is written that this may not be the case. No one at Amazon even mentions this fact to you.When I needed some extra information on more exact instructions on how to use the unit when I was being ignored by the manufacturer they told me I could still return the item for a full refund. This was not an option since a just paid over $ 300.00 to have the system installed and purchased extra cameras, cables, etc for installation.Especially since the item was NOT broken I just needed some technical support for some odd reason the agent and the supervisor got on the phone and told me to just send it back! I explained, as I had earlier, that this was just not an option anymore because I had just spent so much to get it installed!I played with the unit and did finally figure out how to get what I needed from the unit myself and now I am quite satisfied. I have yet to know if the unit has a manufacturers warranty because they have yet to get back to me after several attempts.My only complaint is that Amazon does NOT tell you to check to find out BEFORE you purchase these expensive items to find out exactly what you are getting! Maybe it is just me, but I believe that Amazon takes better care of it's customers than most companies out there and I have read many other customers of Amazon state this belief as well.If you buy from Amazon's Warehouse deals the agents should simply give the customer that little bit of extra information when they tell you about the sales made from there. I just would appreciate them doing that for us. It would only take them a few extra minutes and probably save a ton of worries on the customers minds and Amazon can keep their better than average reputation.Customers please just be aware of these facts when you purchase from Warehouse Deals. I would have given a five evaluation on this device if only they had done that and saved me and themselves a ton of concern and worry.Again this is an excellent product so far! Amazon just needs to say a few more words because some people may not be able to afford to afford to live without the manufacturer. I may be one of them if it turns out to not have any technical support, or the one year warranty on the complete set.I hope this helps at least one person.
