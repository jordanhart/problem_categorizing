I've had them approx 6 months and two of them are already starting to fail. I noticed one of the cam's image was gradually fading then it went almost black but I could still make out the image, barely. Now, once the temp falls below 30deg (Manuf specs indicate operating temp is -25F~122F, ??) the video is completely gone and the dvr indicates \"video loss\" . The other one's image is always pixelating, lines bouncing around everywhere, fading and the colors are not right anymore. Make sure you purchase additional warranty if one is offered. The other two seem to be doing ok thus far. I don't really care for the night vision on these either.UPDATE: 1/31/2012 - Just wanted to add that Zmodo's customer service is horrible too. I've emailed them 3 times and tried the online chat to try and get a repair or replacement and haven't heard anything.
