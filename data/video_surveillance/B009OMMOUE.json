Be sure to make sure your dip settings are correct before you install it. For some reason it was set to camera 2 when I got it but I figured it out soon enough.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheap camera, low quality, doesn't work good", "Author": "First time", "ReviewID": "R3K6P08LIL1KXV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It worked good couple days only.
