One was flakey but had old firmware.  I upgraded it and am seeing if it will work as well as the other two.  All 9 of my cameras are HD (3 indoor hd) 3 indoor fisheye 360 hd and 3 of this outdoor model, (this one is by far the best built).  I have the outdoor cameras plugged into an ethernet hub with a $70 dual band Netgear network wireless adapter and they run without flaw at hd over the 5 ghz band.  Te indoor models all have 2.4 built in adapters which are useless in my neighborhood and this I have those wired or plugged into 5.4 ghz wireless adapters as well.I have tried other brands and they are either TV resolution for the same price or are not configurable with ip monitoring programs.D-link brand seems to be the most well built highest resolution cameras for the best price.Wireless outdoor cameras are useless with my aluminum siding as it acts as a faraday cage and they wont transmit.  I used these cameras and drilled holes and ran the ethernet to a network hub and then to a wireless adapter from Netgear, for an additional cost of $100 total for all 3 cameras.I am not a shill for D-link and they need to improve their app software as I have yet to be able to use 2 way audio consistently... But they are the best out there.Edit:4-27-2013:  IT was below zero weather causing the flakiness at the time of the review.  No problems since the 2-3 day extreme cold streak.I put static ip addresses on my now 10 d link cameras because dhcp worked fine but my Security Monitor Pro software would lose the camera as the ips would change if the router reset.  It is easy to do.  Just go into advanced settings on the My Dlink site and go into network settings and assign manual ip.  I used 192.168.1.160  through 192.168.1.169 for my 10 cameras.  No problems and I have had them several months.", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good daytime quality, poor nighttime quality", "Author": "Leonardo Fuddy \"amazon5815\"", "ReviewID": "R2XB4KW5CFL9WI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera has the distinction of being one of the few 'budget' outdoor POE cameras available.  The short list of pluses and minuses:+++ POE!  It works and it's convenient.+++ Outdoor!  The weather sealing is pretty good.  I only have concern about the speaker area.  Still I would try to avoid exposing it directly to the elements.+++ No through hole mounting!  Most outdoor cameras are very large or in bullet style.  The bullet style cameras typically have a wire harness and require a hole in the side of the wall that they're mounted.  And the wire harness itself is meant to be used indoors.  With this camera only one cable is required and no hole is required right where the camera mounts.+++ Reliable!  It's been running for several weeks with Milestone and the camera hasn't crashed.  That's more than I can say for many consumer grade cameras.+++ ONVIF!  High end feature in a low priced package offers greater compatibility with 3rd party software.+++ True day/night!  The camera has a removable IR cut filter.--- Narrow field of view.  This camera isn't suitable for up-close work.  For example, monitoring an entrance from a nearby mounted camera.--- The night time illumination is lousy.  This results in a very poor and grainy quality video.  Supplemental IR illumination is required for anything that would be considered useful quality.--- Day/night detection.  There are three settings 10, 20 and 30 lux and they don't work well.  On the lower settings the camera flips back and forth between day and night mode repeatedly.  I suspect this is because the light sensor doesn't block IR light.  A bad oversight.--- Night time focus is terrible.  The image is very soft.  It's clear that IR corrected optics were not used which would be absolutely required for a fixed focus camera to operate properly.--- Speaker volume.  It's just way too low.  Don't bother with this camera if you need audio output.--- Microphone sensitivity.  Again, way too low.  It's the worst sensitivity camera that I have used.The camera has many features but disappointingly some of them aren't usable like the night feature and audio features.", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Test first, install second", "Author": "J. Black", "ReviewID": "RAB3B4ZLMAAGL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 2310 works great but I had to return two defective.  I have five of these.  Two were out of focus and one of those with no color.  After I tried many settings with no improvement I returned the cameras.  The replacements worked just like my other three.  I have three under eves and two in direct sun/rain.  All work perfectly.  The IR/night vision is so-so.  I caught a guy stopping his car in the alley and getting out to steal landscaping bricks from my neighbors yard.  The car was about thirty feet from the camera and the license plate is not discernible.  The daytime image is excellent.", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Set up 3 so far with consistent results", "Author": "watah", "ReviewID": "R1CNGJJ24PHHY3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've installed 3 of these on various networks. I've also installed over a hundred IP cameras over the past 3 years. I've added these to existing systems and set them up stand alone. Overall this is an excellent yet pricey camera. The key features that led to this camera vs the various alternatives were:Small Form FactorWeather resistant for outdoorsNight VisionPOE for neat install720p+ resolutionH264 CompressionStandalone DVR abilityWith all these factors considered along with the quality of the playback system, this is a very nice camera.My biggest issue with this unit is the absolute failure I've had using it's DHCP settings. No matter what, it would resort back to the default IP of 192.168.0.20... Ended up costing me $50 in shipping for an overseas client to return it to me after it wouldn't work. Make sure to set it to static.Minor issue, but the DLinkDDNS service included with the unit only works with 1 camera per login. I thought that it was weird for them to have a deterrent for customers to buy multiple cameras, but whatever I'm over it. For multiple cameras either get a domain, dyndns, static WAN IP, deal with multiple links, or make sure you can update the IP when the sh@#ternet provider changes it. Lastly it works great with a POE switch or one of them POE injectors... go with a switch if you are going to deal with multiple cameras or access points. Make sure you know how to forward the required ports in your router, I remember 80 for the web server, and 554 for RTSP off the top of my head.Besides the DHCP issue I was very happy with this camera. I recommend bypassing the mydlink app unless you need it for playback. Disregarding playback there are better viewing mobile apps out there which can handle multiple manufacturers without issues.Neat build, it is really lightweight. Worked fine with a class 10 64GB HCSD Card, got about 2 weeks HD recording from it. Boots in about 10 seconds in case of interuptions. Fast web interface is accessible from most browsers, notably only ios chrome failed.I'll upload some pics of one I put in a green house if I get a chance...Size and price and features considered you can't go wrong for under $300.

However, I could not access images with an iphone or ipad using a 3G network, despite trying several apps, and 8 hours of tinkering with settings.  There is very little troubleshooting information available, and there are 4(!) places that could contain settings to access the camera and that are used to modify settings - a dlink panel for the camera directly, account settings on mydlink.com, settings for your router, and another program called \"D-ViewCam\".

I'd expected with the higher resolution I would be able to read license plates, especially from only 10 feet away - not a chance.I also need motion sensing for security notification and had high hopes for the built-in PIR sensor.  But it turned out to be even more prone to false triggering than the video motion sensor.  The later works well most of the time but triggers on every passing cloud shadow.  Why can't somebody build a camera with a reliable built-in PIR?  I have a standalone PIR from X1 that is very reliable and immune to sunlight.  But there's no external trigger port on the camera to hook it to.Also, the advertised night-time sensitivity doesn't pass the smell test.  And the IR light source is useless beyond 5 feet.  Every time the camera switches from color to bw mode the video motion sensor trips.  The only way to avoid it is to leave it in color which makes night sensitivity even worse!They include a rather cumbersome but seeming complete image/video capture feature.  But you can only have two capture events active during any period.  So I can use motion detection to send pictures to my phone, and to the network drive.  But if I want to do periodic snapshots that's not allowed while the others are enabled.So, I ended up with an outdoor camera that produces pretty pictures for my weather site, but is pretty much useless for security.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid Outdoor 720p PoE Day/Night Camera", "Author": "Leo", "ReviewID": "R1H94BIP4ORUA6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "One of the cheapest megapixel, day/night PoE cameras I found.

It had all of the features I was looking for checked off on the list.  That may be why I'm somewhat disappointed.As a camera, it's pretty good.  The night vision works pretty well.  If a person comes within a reasonable distance to the camera, you'd be able to recognize them.  The picture gets a little grainy when it gets very dark, but every camera does the same thing.  I suspect that some people are expecting the TV \"zoom and enhance\" thing, which doesn't really exist.  RTSP streaming works fine, and I was able to connect with VLC and other clients.The cloud features were actually pretty nice.  I was able to successfully install the application on my phone and connect to the camera remotely.  The video was small, but very watchable.  The whole setup of this part was nearly trivial.Why am I disappointed then, if it's a decent camera?  Mainly because some of the features don't work as expected.  The biggest one is recording to the micro-SD card.  It does it, but it tends to record tiny tiny little clips.  Maybe 5-10 seconds.  Even if the motion is continuous, there is a very short maximum size and length for motion-activated recordings.  Continuous recording has similar limitations.  The max file size is 50MB, which doesn't give you very much video.  That means you'll be sorting through lots of short files to find what you're looking for.A few features just don't work at all.  I tried to enable FTP, only to find it doesn't work.  After struggling with it, I found online that other people are reporting the same issue.  I used a sniffer to analyze the traffic to see exactly what was happening.  It would connect to the server and authenticate successfully, exchange a few messages, and then just disconnect.  It would never transfer any data - it wouldn't even try.  Passive mode didn't make any difference.Is this camera going to work for you?  I guess it depends on what you're expecting.  If you're looking for a basic camera that you can watch over the network, this may be just the ticket.  If you're mainly interested in the cloud features, you may be very pleased with this camera.  If you're looking for an integrated surveillance system, I'd suggest that you look elsewhere.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic So Far", "Author": "My_Fast", "ReviewID": "RLTFGWFNJGMQ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought 2 of these.

I did some research and took a chance on the D-Link IP Cameras. I have the HD PTZ cam as well and its great!! My girlfriend loves to watch our dogs on the camera during the day.
