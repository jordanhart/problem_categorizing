The instructions are in broken English on a tiny piece of paper.  The instructions, for the most part make zero sense.  When I asked the sell for more details, the seller directed me to a You-Tube video from another sell of the same device.  That seller had a better product with English instructions and a cd to load up.  The one I got from Amazon had none of the above.  So now I have a really nice looking clock when I wanted a clock with a easy to use nanny cam.", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "They look wonderful but the perform poorly", "Author": "N22Tango \"Film tonight at 10\"", "ReviewID": "RC1MRW7K44Q22", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought three of these in 2012. My plan was to place two of these inside our home and take one with me to leave in our hotel when we traveled. Although I did not buy mine from Amazon (mine were purchased on Ebay from a seller who was called \"Love For America\" who is/was based in California, but please note these clocks come from the same factory in China. The boxes mine came in are the same boxes as you see in the image here on Amazon and the clocks are identical.I'll start out on the POSITIVE points.* Very attractive little clocks* Beefy (as in when placing one in your hand, they feel heavy and durable)* The tilt mechanism works well so that the clock can be slanted at a variety of angles, and it will hold that position very well.The not so good points.* As others have stated, the instructions are difficult to understand because of the poor translation into a sort of convoluted form of English.* On the face of the camera are very, VERY tiny indicator lights that come on (briefly) when the owner readies the camera for placement in a room. And by saying \"readies the camera\" I mean setting the camera on a desk or table, aimed at a door in case an intruder comes in. The indicator light is hard to see and with all three of the cameras I bought, I was never really certain if the camera indeed was activated.* One camera worked for about three weeks and the image quality was so bad, if you actually had an intruder and you were able to get the tiny SD card to work in your computer, in order to show to police, I'm confident the office would say \"it looks like you got robbed by Casper the ghost. The image detail is very poor.* Battery life is very short. Two of my clocks would run no more than 20 hours and the third would run about 5 hours.* The really bad thing about all three of my clocks are they all died in less than 45 days, one of which lasted no more than a week.* The hands on the face of two of my clocks came loose. One was the second hand on one clock and the minute hand on a second clock.I hate to be so negative, but I also don't like to see people pay for something that I know is going to fail, and in the case of all three of my clocks, they ended up being disposed of.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolutely terrible product.", "Author": "Vince", "ReviewID": "R1EX1JW08C8O75", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "DO NOT BUY this product.
