It is a \"Siamese cable\" ...yeah yeah, I know that's a really politically incorrect name, but there it is. This has a coaxial BNC cable for the video bonded to a low voltage cable for the power; It comes with factory installed molded plugs on all the ends. This product is much cheaper than buying raw plugs and cable then assembling the wiring yourself.The cables I got were a breeze to install, the video quality was good and the power cable worked fine. Because this item is a \"stock length\", it will be easiest to just coil up the excess cable above your camera. You certainly could cut the cable exactly to length, but then you loose the molded factory connections and you'll have to buy replacement ends.5 stars out of 5 because it is reasonably priced, video feed is good, and all the connections are solid.", "Date": "August 25, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$25.99", "Features": "2X 100 Ft CCTV Security Camera Power Video Cable UL", "Name": "Evertech 2X 100 Ft (1x 100ft-white + 1x100ft-black) Cctv Security Camera Power Video Cable Ul", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZKWgaC54L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00846OIBY"}}
