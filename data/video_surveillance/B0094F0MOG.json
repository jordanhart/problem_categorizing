It struggles at night if a crook comes up to the camera and hits it directly with a flashlight light takes a few seconds to refocus and have a describable pic.  unfortunately there is no fan for the hard drive within the unit so your hard drive may get hot if you place the DVR within an inclosed area.", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "complicated", "Author": "Burt47", "ReviewID": "R3N1LO87R6QPM1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good system, It took a long time to figure it out but it works.
