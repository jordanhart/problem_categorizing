{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Might have just saved our lives", "Author": "Michael Clabough \"M. Clabough\"", "ReviewID": "R3MTRWKXH4ULRR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought two of these after another cheaper carbon monoxide detector had alarmed in the middle of the night.  I had read some reviews of the other carbon monoxide detector having false alarms and convinced myself it was probably a false alarm but I opened windows to air out the house.I got these two days ago and they alarmed the first night.  I opened the windows and deduced that it was probably my tankless water heater which was recently installed and failed inspection. It is scheduled to be brought up to code this week.To prove my theory I made sure the central heat was off for a day and we hadn't used the clothes dryer for a few days and I put one of these detectors in the laundry room where the tankless water heater is installed.  We have one of those large jacuzzi style baths in the master bathroom (hence the need to have the tankless) and we took a bath last night.  When we were done the alarm was going off.  I had done some minimal research before doing this test and knew that too high of a level (12,800 ppm) can kill you instantly after just 2 or 3 breaths.  I had read that 400+ can be lethal.  Wikipedia states 800 ppm will cause dizziness, nausea, and convulsions within 45 min and you will be insensible within 2 hours and 1600 ppm can kill you in 2 hours.  So I went downstairs to see what the reading was.I held my breath and went in.  875ppm is what it read.  I called 911 and the firemen came.My wife, 2 year old, and 2 month old were upstairs and in a room with the windows wide open.  They came in and took their readings.  They said they are not allowed to work in an environment where the levels are above 30 ppm without respirators.  The windows had been open for 15 minutes and they were still getting readings over 70.Later, we compared what their professional monitor said to what the my 2nd First Alert Carbon monoxide detector was reading (remember I bought two of these).  Their reading matched exactly what this unit displayed.  So you can trust these devices.Please trust your device.  Thats what you bought it for.  Call 911.  Open windows or get out of there.  The long term affects of Carbon Monoxide exposure can cause heart problems, learning disabilities, and many other terrible things.  I am now worried about what this has been doing to my family over the last 4 months since the water heater was installed.  Like I said I have a 2 month old....I have posted a picture of the unit reading the max value from last night.", "Date": "January 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Seems OK, but have several concerns...  UPDATED", "Author": "Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9 M\u00e9chain \"Pete\"", "ReviewID": "R3ABCFNR7NPP9M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Another update.See recent reviews by others (especially Robert Oppenheim) as well... We just got two of the redesigned ones and indeed they have dropped the remote control feature (good thing) and that would make them deserving of 4 stars, however, they also changed the Peak Level recording, automatically deleting it every 24 hours--that's a bad thing for several reasons and leaves my rating at 3 stars:1)  The peak level resetting should be under user control.2) One wants to know if, say, during the past week, there was an excessively high reading.  Given how it now works, you cannot find that out!A 24-hour automatic clearing of a bad reading hides potentially dangerous, even lethal situations.  (Unless one becomes obsessive about checking this every day!)  In this day and age, they really should have a small memory and track days and peak levels!Here are some other updates--and First Alert deserves credit for listening to some of the critiques.1) The manual, well it is really a pamphlet, is more readable now.2) The warranty has been upped to 7 years.3)  They greatly improved the packaging.Alas, the way the unit is designed means it still wobbles on a nightstand or bureau; the battery cover still doesn't work very well; the CO level still shows up only if one presses the button (and that's a tricky press); the battery symbol still suggests that one is on battery power--they really need a dual indicator for that.  In fact, it would be better if you had to press to get the battery level, but that the current CO level would always be displayed.  (It's now the reverse.)Unfortunately, there's another problem.  The darn thing glows in the dark and lights up an entire room.  It makes it nearly impossible to keep it in a bedroom.  We miss the comfortable soft red light 0 of our old Kidde model immensely (but their newer ones seem to have BRIGHT RED lights now).I would have been happy to give this 4 stars, especially given the various improvements, had they not adopted the 24-hour peak level reset.  Oh, well.--------------------------------------------------------------------------PRIOR REVIEW:I have updated my rating and review to include CONSUMER REPORTS' FINDINGS.  It was top rated by them.  That initially improved my rating, upping it to four stars.  Well, we're now DROPPING it back down one.  We discovered that the remote control \"feature\" (which we had viewed as a gimmick in any case) is not one!  Turns out, that if we press the Mute button on our remotes (just press, not even holding them down), the darn CO alarm goes off!  The remote test operation is only supposed to happen if you hold down the volume or channel button for FIVE seconds.--------------------------------------------------------------------------We bought this to supplement our Kidde Nighthawk CO detectors, the 900-0234 curved model with a 7-year warranty (we didn't want to put all our eggs in one basket!).  The First Alert looks to be a fine CO detector.Here are some positives:1)  It has the plug on a wire, so that you can put the detector somewhere other than right in the outlet.  That's helpful as outlets can have other adapters in them making it hard to plug it in or be behind something rendering the CO detection harder.2)  It can be tested or silenced with a remote (hold down the volume or channel button for 5 seconds) (our Tivo remote worked!).  (Some of their other products with the remote features have received critical reviews as regular remote operation has set them off!)3)  Operates on AC with a battery backup (2 AAs)4)  Batteries ARE included!!5)  A biggie!  Consumer Reports rated this much higher than the Kidde brands.  It's better at detecting low levels of CO.Here are several negatives:1)  5-year warranty unlike the Kidde's 7-year.  [This has apparently been upped to 7 now, but check with the company.)2)  A \"manual\" that's a huge, cumbersome, folded sheet, with small print that's blurry and hard to read.  They should supply a magnifying glass with it!  This is a major concern as one needs to refer to the text for installation, for operation, to determine what to do under certain conditions, etc.  [This also supposedly has been improved.]3)  Yes, one can park the detector on a bookshelf (with the cord going to the outlet), but the detector itself wobbles!  The previous Kidde CO detector Nighthawk model--the COPP-3 -- has the plug on a cord feature, along with a nifty slide out stand that makes it stable.  (We had good luck with that model, but many did not.  Plus, it's an older model, with only a 5-year warranty which is why we went for the 900-0234).4)  The CO level only shows up if one presses a button.  It's a cool blue light, but unlike the Nighthawk's red LED that shows you the current CO level at all times (a reassuring 0), this displays a blank screen with a recessed green light.  For some, it could be a plus as it would be less intrusive especially as the Kidde's red LED seems to be much brighter on their latest model.5)  The detector displays a battery icon when it's plugged into AC and the battery is installed!  That's unnerving as it makes it look as if it's running on the battery!  Very odd design choice, as in most of the electronic world, that's an indication that you are running on battery power and no longer on AC (take any laptop, e.g.).6)  The test alarm didn't seem as loud as the Kidde's.7)  Battery cover is the front of the device, which the manual didn't explain or illustrate, and it doesn't shut well--or rather, it's awkward and you feel as if you're about to break the lightweight plastic parts.8)  One other issue, which plagues all the CO detectors and many other products on the market, is the infuriating, hard plastic packaging.  It's hard to open and I even cut myself on it.  There are alternatives that are just as secure but much friendlier to the environment and the customer!In comparing the two (Kidde Nighthawk 900-0234 and the First Alert CO615), the advantage on first glance clearly goes to the Kidde.  It just seems a more professional, better designed, and better thought out product.  Part of that is because we're used to the Kidde design and like the red LED, but it also seems more solid (the First Alert has the seemingly fragile/flimsy cover), and has a higher quality, usable manual--it's a real booklet that's more readable and better organized (it also has a bigger font than FA's, but still could be larger).UPDATE--OTOH, I'm a believer in most of what CR does--and the testing on these--and the user reports here and on the web--suggest that it is the better detector.  And, after all, that's what one buys these things for!  However, we're not going to be able to use this in our bedroom as the Mute button sets off the alarm!", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Well thought out design, but nothing special.", "Author": "S.

Yes, batteries are included with this product).  After inserting the batteries and plugging this into the wall outlet in the bedroom, I saw a battery meter flash.  It showed the battery had full power.2) The battery door is on the front of the unit.  I like this design because you can have access to the battery compartment while leaving the unit plugged into wall.  Also, I was able to open the battery door easily with one finger.3) I like the display button.  When pressed, the unit will show you the highest carbon monoxide level recorded.  This is something I plan to monitor often.4) Green light vs Red light.  When I plugged it in, the light is green.  Should the device ever detect unsafe levels of CO, the light will turn red and the audible alarm will go off.  While I hope to never see the red light, it is reassuring to see the green light and know the room is safe.What you might like to know about this product:1) I recommend that you open the packaging from the bottom.  I could not separate the plastic packaging at the top.  However, it easily opened at the bottom, and continued to open all the way along the sides - up to the top, where I could no longer separate the plastic seal.2) All CO monitors that I've researched intentionally stop functioning after 5-7 years (for your safety).  This is due to the life of the CO sensors.  I've owned KIDDE brand and now this First Alert brand, and they all expire.  Replacing these devices after 7 years is piece of mind to ensure you always have a functioning CO sensor that will accurately detect carbon monixide.3) This unit should be replaced 7 years from the month/year you first installed it. (see the bottom of page six in the owners manual for more information about this).4) This particular brand/model is currently ranked #1 by a leading consumermagazine.For best results:1) Use only Energizer E91 batteries and replace them immediately when the unit tells you to.  Never use rechargeable batteries with this device.2) Install the device away from windows or fans. (Blowing air may prevent CO from reaching the sensors).3) Install the device 10 feet away from a water source (bathroom or laundry room).4) The device is intended for bedroom and living areas.

I would have given it 5 stars instead of 4, except for the fresh-dating issue.I bought two of these carbon monoxide detectors from Amazon two years ago, in April, 2010.  I like the following features:- It is powered by plugging it in, with a battery backup.  So, it does not use the batteries much, but it will still operate if there is a power failure.  And the batteries are two AA's, so they are not expensive.- No false alarms.  I don't want to lose a night's sleep for no reason!- The batteries are not depleted as long as the unit has AC power.  In two years, there is no noticeable drop in battery voltage.  Therefore, I am not awakened by low-battery warnings, like the purchasers of some other brands.- Digital readout.  You can press the button and see the reading at any time.  Mine have always been zero; if I saw anything else, I would look for furnace, water heater, stove, or other appliance malfunctions.  Some people have complained that it does not display the reading constantly, without pressing a button; I suspect this would drain the batteries more quickly in case of a power outage.- Detachable plug with extension cord.  You can plug in the unit at ground level and install it much higher, so you can read it easily, and also have the unit sense readings higher off the ground.  (Carbon monoxide is just slightly lighter than air.)I decided to purchase a third detector from Amazon.  But when I put in the search criteria \"Co615\" with an \"All Departments\" search, a little note was displayed with a date of \"May 2, 2007\".  I e-mailed Amazon customer service to find out if this was the date of manufacture, and they confirmed it was.  This date is unacceptable.  The detectors have chemical components that deteriorate over time, even if the unit is not turned on, and this date is FIVE YEARS AGO.  I decided to purchase my third unit from First Alert directly in order to get a fresher unit.  If I had received an older unit, it still would have been warranted by First Alert for seven years from date of purchase.  However, I did not want to buy an item that had an increased chance of failing prematurely.I think both First Alert and Amazon can do better on the fresh-dating issue.  First Alert should put the date of manufacture where it can be seen without opening the package.  Right now, it is only on the unit, and you have to open the package and remove the plug to see it.Amazon only displays the mysterious date (which happens to be the manufacture date) on the \"All Departments\" search result screen. It does not appear in the detailed description of the item.  It also does not appear if you search within a particular department, like \"Tools and Home Improvement\".

You can push a button to have it show the maximum amount of CO detected in the current preset 24 hour period (though it is unclear when the 24 hour periods begin and end). Mine has never displayed more than 0 when I tested for that, which I guess means it hasn't reached the minimum detectable amount (not that there has been no CO present).

It reminded me that our old detector (Kidde Nighthawk) had eventually got to the end of its life and we had to throw it out and we had not replaced it. So we looked for a replacement that we could put up easily in a good location.How do you judge a CO detector? I searched online and checked out reviews of those that actually test these things with Carbon Monoxide and found that the First Alert was frequently rated better than the other brands. I wanted one that had both AC power and a battery backup and this one fit the bill.Here's what I like: After opening it up and popping in the included batteries, it was ready to go! The attached plug and cord are designed so that you can install it directly into an outlet or hang it somewhere else and run the cord to the outlet. But since Carbon Monoxide sinks, plugging it in at wall outlet height just makes sense (It can also be rotated 90 degrees in the outlet to make more room). You really don't even need to look at the instruction manual because it is so easy!People make a big deal about the lighting, etc. on the digital display, but here is the thing to know: The displays on these CO detectors generally do not display anything until the level reaches 30 ppm (even the ones with the always-on red digital display). Anything under 30 ppm and it simply says 0. So the only reason you need the display is if the alarm actually goes off. At that point the LCD flashes red and the number is displayed so that you can report it. I also like that this unit will keep the number in memory for 24 hours (after all, who of us will remember the number if the alarm is going off at 2:00 AM and you are calling 911?). The rest of the time, all you have to do is look at it and there is a small green led indicating that things are ok.

the outlet with the extension & separate plug.  The plug and extension wire is built into the back, but can be pulled out.  The unit is a little bulky and I didn't want it seen in my living room or bedroom prominently in my wall outlets.  So I rather run the plug to a hidden outlet and put it in a dresser or end table out of the way.  However, it sits okay on a table, but I wish it came with a stand to help.  It seems to expect you to mount it on a wall or outlet.  But it looks just fine on a table to the side.The manual has some useful unexpected information that is worth a read through.  It talks to location considerations like not too near your kitchen, and not too near ceiling or corners due to dead space that might not get circulation of CO, or too near ceiling fans or vents in which CO might not reach the sensor, etc.  It was worth a read compared to the usual boredom of manuals.The construction seems fine to me.  I didn't notice any trouble with the battery door.  Just open it from the top, evenly, and focus on where the latch is near the middle of the door that you will see plainly as you open it and look in.  The batteries fit *very* tightly in one of the two units I bought so will be a little more difficult to remove, but still okay.  But don't consider this a batter operated unit.  It only uses batteries as backup.  The button to get the CO peak level over the last 24 hours doesn't seem very responsive, but always works after a few tries.  It always shows 0 for me, but I don't think I should expect more if everything is fine.", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazon was great to work with", "Author": "Robert Fukai \"dvd lover\"", "ReviewID": "R3PTO1QAJD3ZL8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was well-rated by a consumers oraganization and we got them for our home.

I have two complaints.  One, the digital readout can only be read at close range, but I could have guessed this from the photos.  Two, the placement requirements -- which are probably not unique among CO detector products -- are onerous.

An older nonfunctional one that came with my house was twice that size. The little LED light tells you it's operating but is not garish, way less than a nightlight. And the manufacturer apparently listened to all the previous complaints about the battery compartment because I had no problem at all installing them and I believe the instructions even had a note about that.

This thing really works!Since the reading always went down to 0 when I pressed the \"stop making noise\" button, shut the furnace off, and opened my bedroom door, I wasn't sure whether it was detecting a real, low-level issue, or just breaking. So to test that, I bought a second CO615 from my local Target (at about twice the price) to see if it would go off too.  And it does.So the alerts were legitimate, and this alarm kept me from harm, which is the whole point!Deducting one star for the display being garbled, the buttons being hard to use, and for it just seeming so broken that I didn't believe it and first & ended up spending 3x the money to figure it out, but the most important thing for this alarm to do is detect dangerous levels of CO, and it did it!******I'm not sure what to think about this.  Consumer Reports gave it a good rating, esp. for low levels of CO.  But the display on mine is now so garbled so that I can't read the numbers, and the buttons are faulty, so I can't get a peak level reading.  I only bought it 4 months ago.I've been using my furnace for about a month with no alarms sounding, but now it consistently goes off 2 hours after I turn my furnace on (aka 2 hours into me being asleep, bummer).  Then the level drops to 0 the moment I open my bedroom door, which seems fishy.I wanted to check what the peak level was following a day at work with the furnace off.  First day I tried it, the level was 35 ppm, higher than I had even seen it at night (~17 ppm). Second day I tried to check, I had to mash the peak level button for such a long time that it ended up clearing the peak level, but I think it read 45 for a split second before it cleared.  That was 2 days ago, and since then I haven't been able to get a reading, peak or otherwise, at all.I guess I'll do some more tests over the weekend...but I hate to waste emergency services by calling 911 if it turns out the unit is just defective.In the meantime, I'm only running the furnace for an hour at a time.

Other units display the current CO level at all times.  The First Alert only displays a blank screen.The display is difficult to read in most lighting conditions.You are forced to use the battery backup (whether you want the feature or not - and it is NOT an important feature).  Once the battery is low, the incessant chirping is unnerving - forcing you to replace the batteries.  It also does not work well with rechargeable batteries:  The lower voltage (1.2 volts) of rechargeable batteries causes the unit to consider them discharged long before they actually are (which means you're getting the incessant chirping - usually at night - every month).You risk damaging the product fighting to get it out of its plastic packaging after purchase.

You insert the two AA batteries for backup power during electrical outages, then plug the device into an unswitched electrical outlet.  That's it.A continuous green light tells you the unit is on AC power; a blinking green light tells you it's on backup power. The instruction sheet explains how to test the unit when you first install it, and advises weekly testing after that.  To start the test, you press and hold a half-button on the left (below the display).  This activates the alarm:  the display cycles through the possible CO levels, and the horn sounds a moderately loud but piercing alarm.  To turn the alarm off, you press and hold the left half-button again.  Testing the alarm usually takes me a couple of tries, because the half-button must be pressed quite firmly.There is another half-button on the right (below the display), that you press for a display of the highest CO level recorded by the unit.  My unit is still displaying \"0\" after about five weeks, which I assume is correct, because there's no reason to think the unit isn't functioning properly.  The CO level display also includes an icon that tells how much charge is left in the backup batteries.This seems like a good, inexpensive, no-nonsense CO monitor, and I trust the First Alert brand.

Our only way of guessing that the CO levels in our house are safe was the fact that no alarm sounded when we plugged it in, but how could we know if the lack of alarm meant the house was safe, or the unit was defective? Never did find the button that I thought we were supposed to be able to push in order to see the full display and find out what exactly the CO level is.Overall, we found this CO alarm confusing and unusable, and sent it back immediately.

Palmer", "ReviewID": "R9ERDLMY0BDUC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this particular model because I wanted an AC-powered detector. In my opinion, powering CO and fire detectors by batteries is wasteful. If you follow the \"change the batteries in the spring and fall\" on Daylight Savings time changes or whatever, you end up discarding and wasting batteries that are usually still good. I don't know what your power situation is, but my power is up 99.99% of the time. The chances of a fire or high-CO occurring while the power is off, for me, is... well, I'm better off playing the lottery. So I'm perfectly comfortable with the use of with AC-only units. Oh, and when my power goes off, I wake up instantly. The house going completely silent is not normal. I'll be awake in case of a fire during the power loss, and a lack of power won't increase CO levels.The catch on this model is that while it's powered by AC, it still requires two AA batteries as backup, or the thing will annoyingly beep once a minute to remind you that batteries are dead or not inserted. You cannot silence the alert permanently. So I'm back to wasting batteries AND AC power. It won't run exclusively on batteries either, per the documentation.The packaging is plastic vacuform, wasteful, and hard to open. Shame. The AC adapter cord is generously long, mounting screws and batteries are included.I would buy a different detector next time, one that will satisfy my criteria of AC-only operation, and doesn't require batteries, period.", "Date": "July 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "First Alert CO615 Carbon Monoxide Plug-In Alarm with Battery Backup and Digital Display", "Author": "B.

I don't think it works with out the batteries even if it is plugged in to the wall outlet.It plugs into the 110Volt wall outlet with a removable plug (with wires back to the housing) held into the housing with two plastic clips.  When the kids pull it off the wall, the electrical plug tends to stay connected to the outlet and the housing drops to the floor (about 11 inches onto tile).  The housing has never been damaged but one of the plastic clips that hold the plug into the housing eventually broke.So after that the housing would not stay in place very well and would tend to drop to the floor on it's own.  I don't fault the manufacture for this since plastic clips are typical for this kind of stuff.  I rigged up a wire zip tie to hold the plug into the housing to keep the housing from falling onto the floor.I have to admit I don't know it it really works since it has never alarmed (or shown any detectable CO on the screen), other than low battery.

The gas company tech advised that a hose on the water heater be shortened and that the back door be kept open to dissipate the gas.  Purchasing this unit was a more reasonable way to solve the circulation problem since the temps were below freezing.  It is very easy to install and set.  Instructions are simple.  Plug-in convenient.  All features are simple enough for almost anyone to use.  During my 3 week visit there were no false alarms or malfunctions.  The unit works as described and gives me some peace of mind 600 miles away.  Unfortunately, the only way to know if it functions as designed is when there is a problem, which is why it gets 4 stars for now.  Keeping my fingers crossed.  FYI: There was also a buildup of carbon residue around and under the stove top, which can be raised like the hood of a car. It looks like black soot and also gives off an odor.
