The REVO cameras that I bought along with the REVO R4DVR4 (4 camera DVR) was very easy to configure and set up.  The video quality is great and very happy with the night vision as well.The only issue I have with the system is that you can't set up the monitor screen to view only 2 cameras.  The smallest screen configuration I could set was 2x2 even though I set the DVR to only use 2 cameras.  I emailed support asking if it was possible to view only 2 cameras and never got a response.But you can still view the 2 cameras on the top part of the screen and simply click a smaller screen to go full screen.  Overall, I'm happy with this system.  I would definitely recommend this system for a small camera setup.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$349.99", "Features": "4 Channel Digital Video Recorder in compact size; 4 - RJ12 cable inputs\nREVO's EZLink Technology will automatically network your DVR to the internet when connected to most routers\nView and control video remotely over the internet or mobile phone with Network/Remote Viewing\nDVR can be set to send Push Notifications to most smart phones when any or all of the camera's detect motion\n500GB Hard Drive", "Name": "Revo R4DVR4-5G  4-Channel DVR 120IPS 500GB Hard Drive", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31nrhYdSVQL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009V9BI7A"}}
