Could not get it to work to view on iphone, etc.  I have another dvr hooked up to the same router and works perfectly fine.  Customer service tried to troubleshoot it but was unsuccessful and told me that they would call me back to figure out the problem.  Never heard from them again.In terms of overall quality, very cheap.  When viewing live footage on my mac, the resolution was terrible and there's no way to adjust it.  I called customer service yet again and they could not help as there were no adjustments.Even at 100.00, it's not worth it.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Basic, but cheap DVR", "Author": "Dan Barney", "ReviewID": "R1QRJJJYNB0Q8Q", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The DVR is very basic.  The remote serves almost no function, you can't use the record buttons, software is very scetchy.

I read the last review and wondered what mobile app they were using. I was able to set up 3 mobile phones for viewing and one of them was an iPhone. My favorite free viewing app for this DVR is Asee.Because of its basic setup I would normally give this DVR three stars but because of the great price I will give it a four.", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good value: good features and price", "Author": "N Desai", "ReviewID": "R36QWDJXXU7SA3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would give 5 stars if: 1) there is better manual. Like other Chinese products the manual is lacking in detail, 2) the receptacles in the back of the box, for the 16 cables are placed so close by that it is difficult to get proper hold with my not so stubby fingers. I had to use pliers to turn the quick connects, 3) the on-screen menus could have been better designed and explained.Having said that, I have used other brands - more expensive ones - and this one is far better, and offers a great value. I have not used all the features yet though.", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best price ever!", "Author": "Dean Thomas", "ReviewID": "R23N4EG2O3P9S5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was about to buy this exact system for almost twice the price when I found it here.

When motion is detected, a three second pre-record should occur. That way when you click on an alert you can actually see the event as it happens. However, this 16 channel machines software does not allow for that. What happens is when a motion is detected let say at 10:23:31 PM you click on the alert video and it starts viewing the occurrence three to four seconds after the motion occurred. Say at 10:23:34. This time delay allows someone to actually NOT be caught on camera if they were to move across viewing area of camera.", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works as reqired", "Author": "PastorBob", "ReviewID": "R13VODN5Q4K4R4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Set up took a lot more then I was expecting with regards to programing and internal set up the instructions are similar to a vcr kinda hard to get.", "Date": "April 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Zmodo 16CH Video DVR Security urveillance Cameral System Witg 1TB", "Author": "Beverly P.

Although the buttons and IR remote function seem to me to be of not much utility, logging in through the network and the mouse operation let me customize the recording, masking of moving things and basically perform more than basic setups. Impressed for the price. Higher resolution cameras make a difference, and PTZ works remotely, but needs some fine tuning to gain finer control. No issues with a few IP cam apps and the Zmodo app itself I put on my Droid.If I have a negative issue, it's that the MP4 and AVI formats it saves recordings in aren't compatable with the recent RealPlayer and Windows Media Player, you have to use the utility version that comes with the DVR. Although that too can be placed on the saved media with the files for others to use to view them. With that, it has done everything I need it to do, although a newer file type conversion would be nice.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Zmodo 16 ch DVR", "Author": "Ed Kion", "ReviewID": "RWMR1LGSMUJHA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So far so good.
