Terrible experience with vendor!", "Author": "TAS \"TAS\"", "ReviewID": "R1EDI5REBYFWVI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Nice sturdy design and wires are protected. Has a great picture and very good night vision. However, despite the sturdy design, the unit went bad in less than a week.At first when I plugged it in, it was stubborn and didn't want to work. I checked all the connections and tapped the unit and it started working. I didn't think much of it at the time. With in a day or so, the camera went out so I messed with it again and it started working again. A couple days after that, it went out again for good. I checked all the connections, ran a second test wire to the unit to rule ou my first wire but it had the same results. The unit is bad. I guess that happens...However, after contacting the place where I purchased, now I have to send it back to them on my dime and if they find the unit to be bad, will send me a new one. I really wish I didn't have to deal with all this extra hassle and cost. The camera maker should test their units better before shipping them.After dealing with vendor on this, I am downgrading to 1 star because zero is not an option.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$299.99", "Features": "Built-in 1/3\" SONY Exview CCD II EFFIO-E imager, color DSP, automatic CDS sensor.
