Not only do you get the DVR with a 1TB HDD Installed, but you get 4 Zmodo Cameras sporting the Sony CCD Image Sensor. Great Cameras with a great DVR System, and at a Great Price. Shipping was fast! This system comes with the DVR, Remote Control, Mouse, Software, Mounts, and all the Power Cables you'll need. Everything is in the Box that you'll need to get Started. Please note, the Cameras that come with this System DO NOT have built in Microphones. Please see Zmodo's Amazon Site to add 1, or several Audio/Video Cameras. If Audio is something you need, they have a great selection of Cameras with Built in Microphones. I ordered this system with 2 Extra Cameras that Sport Audio as well... All Told, This system, and 2 Added Cameras with Audio and Cables ran me $308.00. I give Zmodo and this Particular Product 5 Bright Stars!", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better Than Expected.", "Author": "David G.", "ReviewID": "R2DWGDYER7TAQG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This security system was better than expected. Did a lot of research and settled on the 8 channel 1TB Hard Drive with four Sony cameras. The picture quality is very good, color is also very good. I was more impressed with the quality of night recording. Everything I needed was in the box. Still have not set to view with mobile or over the internet. Hopefully, will do that in the near future.

Ordered it on Thursday, and received it on Monday!!  System was easy to set up (haven't tried to get it on the network yet, but don't expect any problems) and works pretty good.  The video cables should be replaced with a better one if you want the best picture.  The cameras haven't been tried outside yet, but work well in the dark, as distances of less than 30 feet.I had one major disappointment with this unit.  The power supply only runs one camera.  If you want to use more than one camera, you have to buy an additional power supply.  WHAT??!!?!??  Yep.  There is a power supply included for one camera.  While a power supply that will run 8 cameras ins't expensive, I am a little aggravated that I now have to order another power supply before I can actually set up the system.  (AFTER LOOKING AT THE PAGE FOR THIS UNIT< I AM CONTACTING THE SELLER TO SEE WHY I DIDNT GET THE 1 to 4 SPLITTER SHOWN IN THE LISTING)This would have been an easy 4+ stars if the power supply had been included, or if at least it was mentioned in the propaganda that a additional power supply was needed.", "Date": "June 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice starter system for the price", "Author": "Joe Blow", "ReviewID": "REUCL550PGPZG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After reading many reviews and researching many security camera systems I decided to go with the this one.PROS:1TB hard drive and it is already installed.The dvr system is easy to set-up and  navigate through. Even the network setup was easy. They have quite a few videos on youtube to follow. Motion detection, email notifications and all that works great.Lets you record in many different settings including D1.The cameras that come with it are ok for starter cameras. The colors look good and night vision works up to about 15 feet.The Zmodo tech support is actually pretty good. I contacted them online and over the phone and they were very helpful.It is easy to add additional cameras and microphones to the system.CONS:Two of the cables broke when installing the cameras. The cables are very weak and can break easily. Also they aren't quite long enough. I recommend purchasing additional cables that are 100 feet long.The detail on the cameras that come with the system is not that great. Somebody needs to be within 10 feet of the camera in order for you to identify them. Any farther than 10 feet away and they are unrecognizable. The night vision works ok if you have exterior lighting, but if not, the night vision only works up to about 10 feet away. I purchased  a few higher quality cameras to go with these cameras. As with most security systems I think this system works better as a detourant than a way of actually capturing criminals in the act.Installing the cameras and cables can be a bear especially if you have to crawl through the attic and drill holes.The email notification could be better. It merely emails you a low resolution picture of the motion that is detected. Would be better if it actually emailed you the video.The remote viewing option requires you to make your network more vulnerable to viruses, hackers, etc. because you have to open ports and disable certain firewalls and such. I decided not to use this remote viewing option for now because I did not want to disable my firewall.Final Thoughts:For the cost you can't really beat this system. The dvr itself is worth the price and the cameras and cables are like freebies. I definitely recommend upgrading the cameras if you want good resolution and night vision that works more than 10 feet away. This Zmodo system is a nice starter system, but definitely requires some upgrading of the cameras.", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than expected for the money paid", "Author": "Damian Marynski", "ReviewID": "R266I782V171OV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research on surveillance cameras before I placed my order on Amazon.  Looking over some reviews I have found that some reviews don't tell actually what they should.What to take into consideration?First you need to analyze where the cameras will be located and how many do you actually need? Yes, you can have up to 8 cameras on this Zmodo 8 CH surveillance system. If the cameras will be located near each other within the cable range then you are good, but if you will need to extend the cables make sure to buy Female to Female, Male to Female head connectors to extend the cable as they don't come with the unit.The camerasThe camera  picture at night is good enough to see the person walking. However, you won't be able to see the person's t-shirt color or pant's color, unless they get closer to the cameras. If  the cameras are placed outside and it is night time I strongly recommend adding motion activated lights from Home Depot or Lowe's, they are anywhere from $30 to $80.The cameras perform beautiful during the day. You will be able to tell clearly who is coming, or who just passed.The SystemThe system came with 1TB hard drive already on board so that is plenty for 2 full weeks of recording under 6 cameras. I have currently 6 installed and when I went on vacation for two weeks I was able to see what happened around the house. Connecting the system to the cameras is very easy and it can be done within an hour or so depends on how many cameras you plan on using.The best part is that while you are away you can take a look at the cameras from your local PC, tablet, laptop, iPhone or Android phone.  Someday recommend using an IP Cam Viewer application which can be downloaded from iTunes or Play Store. The free version only allows up to 4 cameras but I bought the pro version and that version allows up to 8 or 16 cameras.Before you buy this unit make sure to make a list of everything you will need* Female to Female connectors or Male to Female depends on your setup* Home Depot or Lowe's Lights* Adding more cameras", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good starter system with good features", "Author": "Jess Hoodenpyle", "ReviewID": "RGIH69KA5GR5C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm using this system for my home.

The cameras do take decent day pictures but their claim of 65' night pictures is ridiculous, more like 20'.

Cameras are fairly easy to mount and set up but the connection to the DVR will stick, making them difficult to unplug if you need to swap them around. The menus take a little getting used to, not exactly intuitive, but after poking around a little it's not too bad.  I set up the device on my home network without too much difficulty and now I can connect to it over the Internet from wherever I am.The only real complaint I have is the sensitivity setting for motion detection. There are levels 1-4 with 1 being the least sensitive.  I have tinkered with these and have yet to find any rhyme or reason as to what makes them tick.  I have tried setting them on 2 and had the trees across the street trigger the camera.  Nothing else in the frame is moving and the camera will run for hours. But at night, it captures nothing. I can walk up to the camera without triggering it.  I move the sensitivity up to 3 or 4 and finally it will trigger and I can lower the sensitivity, even down to 2 or 1, and it will trigger.  Other times, still set on 2, I get days and days of video of a spider web on the camera, then it doesn't capture cars going by the front of my house.It would be nice to set the cameras so they trigger on movement so you don't have to search through hours of nothing but if you just want to set it to capture everything at specific times of the day or just let it run all the time, this is a decent device.The color is pretty good and there is a menu for color correction. At night it switches to black and white but still captures a pretty good image.  The system can be upgraded to add up to 8 cameras and a PTZ (pan, tilt zoom) camera with controls.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome !

Port forwarding is required for remote viewing but the website has a great walkthru customized for any system they sell as well as most home routers.Why 4 not 5? The product I received (zmd-dd-san8) required firmware update to operate properly for remote viewing. This is a simple enough process but the firmware wasn't listed as a support download but rather as a knowledge base page in a different part of the site. Requires use of fat32 USB flash drive to transfer said firmware. Only found this when troubleshooting why it wasn't working. Finding the correct android phone/iPad viewing software is also a chore, I tried three different viewers before deciphering the site.
