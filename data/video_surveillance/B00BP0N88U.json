I have one for the dining room with the back door in view, a second one in the porch with the front door in view and a third one to monitor my garage. I'm not tech savvy--but it only took me 1 days by the consultation with the esky technique guy to figure out how to \"port forward\" these to work via the wireless router--to view on web or mobile phone app. I thought i had to purchase third party software to run them on the internet and/or open an account at dyndns. I discovered i was wrong on both counts. These cams have built-in DDNS and free software and is really user-friendly.The most amazing part is the IR-CUT lens. The built-in IR-cut filter in H6800 blocks infrared light to make image colors more realistic. The H6800 would be the ideal solution for people who either need a high quality camera or want to replace the dumb cameras without IR-cut. I think you'll love them.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Camera. Worked well for what I needed.", "Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "R3N5DBBQB6ASS1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera after having some issues with vandalism. I tried a few options for camera systems, this being one of them.I was pleased with the quality of the camera itself after taking it out of the box. It seemed sturdy and appeared to be waterproof as they say. There is a removable metal shield on the top of the camera to protect it. One issue I ran into right out of the box was the lack of the micro SD card slot. A quick call to customer service informed me the slot is accessed by removing the back panel of the camera. This, I guess, would add to the waterproofing. Customer service was very helpful; I called the number and a real person answered, rare these days.I then set up the camera. It was actually fairly easy with the included software. I did have to manually set up port forwarding on my router to get it to work correctly, but I do have an old off brand router. The recording software is also fairly user friendly. Once I played with the settings a bit, I found this camera recording software had all the options I needed for my situation.I am pleased with the purchase and it has been up and running for about 2 weeks now with few issues. One issue required me to power off and power on the camera to fix. The other was an issue with my computer and unrelated to the camera or software.", "Date": "May 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "simply doesn't work", "Author": "Madtown", "ReviewID": "R2PAW00T272X19", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the camera does power on, but that is about it.

This camera carries on the outstanding part of c5900 in deep. The live video is fluent with high quality, consuming low bandwidth comparing wansview ncb543w I bought before. The IR-cut lens makes the image more realistic and vivid. Another point impresses me is, unlike Foscam camera, that it provides permanent-free DDNS service enabling easy access to the camera when I am away from home. If you firstly use Esky H6800 and know little about network setting, I highly recommend you asking their technique support for help, who will do you a great favor and save you time and energy. I rated the H6800 camera 5 stars not because it\u2019s that perfect. Actually, its software and control panel has little difference with c5900, useful but a little tough, not easy to use, high space for improvement. Wish this will be better in near feature. The camera indicates that it could not support audio (microphone and speaker), which would not be shortage for me for my backyard security.

Unfortunately, the software is not. It does not have very many features and the record to SD card feature does not playback very well. The desktop client records in AVI format but the SD card records in H264 format. Ordinarily this wouldn't be a problem but it doesn't appear to be a standard .264 format so playback is difficult to achieve with third party viewers and the manufacturer doesn't offer any playback viewers on the website. What's worse is the desktop application does not appear to be capable of playing the downloaded h264 format files. HUGE FLAW. What's the point in having recorded video if you can't play it back using the desktop client? Web access is very limited and many of the features are not available at all over the web. This also depends on the type of browser you're using. I had to use a combination of Firefox and IE just to get the playback to work. In addition, the SD card is inside the unit requiring the user to break the seal, which according to the sticker voids the warranty. Good thing the seller was very good about honoring the warranty anyway because due to the software issues I returned this camera.Also, side note: I couldn't get the motion record to work at all.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Setup Failed - Could not find wireless network", "Author": "Robert D Bartizek", "ReviewID": "RSGL2TNOSM83D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I spent several hours over 3 days trying to get this camera to work properly.

Troubleshooting tips say to download new firmware and software but these items were not available for download from the site.

I'm sending it back.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent hardware but bad software and no technical support.", "Author": "Vaughn \"The answer man!\"", "ReviewID": "R1EBPARVT5J7OH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you are looking for a budget outdoor IP camera, I would say this camera fits that bill, but there are some caveats.Pros:Low cost, durable quality and decent image.Cons:Non existent tech support and technical information and bad software.  Also, the remote access feature does not work if you have a WIMAX internet service ( true for most IP cams that rely on port forwarding for remote access).  Has an internal SD card slot that requires voiding the warranty to access.VIDEO QUALITY:While this camera does do what it is designed for, there are a few things that you should know about it.  One it is a standard VGA video unit. Don't let the H.264 fool you into thinking you are getting a higher quality. H.264 refers to the video compression standard. That being said, I would say that the video from this camera might be ever so slightly clearer compared to my Foscam FI8910 IP camera.BUILD QUALITY:As far as the build of the camera, structurally it feels solid and well built.SOFTWARE:This camera comes bundled with  IP Camera Super Client.  This software is not fully compatible with the firmware of the camera.  While some features work well, other features like modifying motion detection sensitivity do not work well with the firmware of the camera.  The camera does have a web interface that works well, but is very limited compared to the functionality of the IP Camera Super ClientTECHNICAL SUPPORT:LOL! What techincal support.  Just to give you an idea of how \"Fly By Night\" this ESKY company is, go to their website and see for yourself that the H6800 is not even listed in their product line. Try doing a site search for H6800 and you will get no results.  I have spent hours trying to find an actual manual for the H6800.  It does not exist.  Honestly though, there are several other cameras offered by Foscam and others that look identical to this one and also do not have any technical manuals or information that apply specifically to this model.  I tried to give ESKY a call but both numbers I tried went straight to an old fashion cheap answering machine (you know, the \"Please leave your name and number\" kind you used to have in with your land line in the 1990s) with no option to hold.THE MYSTERIOUS SD CARD SLOT:The H6800 is advertised as having a Micro SD card slot that will hold up to a 32Gb card.  I have search this camera over with a fine tooth comb and this card slot does not exist. There are no official instructions anywhere on the internet as to where this card slot is or the proper way to access it.  Some have said that the slot is located inside the camera.  The only way to get inside the camera is to take it apart which will break the warranty seal voiding the warranty. Even so, I have tried opening the camera up, but could not find a way to do it without causing potential damage to camera. At risk of breaking the camera, I took the back off and looked inside the camera.  There was no SD card slot visible. After trying unsuccessfully to find a way to get the guts of the camera out of the without breaking something, I put it back to gather and prayed that it still worked.  Bottom line.  Until I see an \"OFFICIAL\" set of detail instructions (that currently does not exist) on how to insert an SD card into this camera without voiding the warranty, I am going to say that, for all intents and purpose, this camera does not have the \"Advertised\" micro sd slot, or at least not one that is accessible to the common person.REMOTE ACCESS:I live out in the country with no options for high speed internet access other then WIMAX.  I have great service and can watch online streaming video from Netflix or Amazon Video with no problem.  But because of the router hardware needed to get service to me, I cannot access remotely IP cameras that depend on port forwarding.  So if you have WIMAX internet service, just know that you will not be able to remotely access this camera.THE BOTTOM LINE:For what it is, it does an okay job if all you are looking for is a basic VGA outdoor camera.

Even with Wi-Fi turned off, this camera emits enough noise that it disables the gate opener receiver.  I've read that other cameras (Foscam especially) that do the same thing with garage door openers.

If you plan to install this camera near any garage or gate opener, think twice since it probably will result in disappointment.If you own their C5900 indoor cameras (which are pretty good), you will probably like this model.  This is their 1st outdoor rated model which has H.264 and SD card recording.  It may have been mentioned before, but this model uses a standard sized SD card (the size is not clear in the product's description# (I am using a class 10 32GB card) which is somewhat of a challenge to insert inside the camera once you have the back removed.  It took me several attempts to get it inserted correctly and then it works fine.  Also, this camera, unlike the 5900 models, does NOT have any provisions to allow audio.  There are no audio connections available nor speaker connections despite this company's claim that it does have this ability on eBay.  The box it came in had white tape over the audio in and out mentions.  Also, be aware the camera comes set with a 192.168.1.xxx #in my case 126) address so you will have to first set your computers LAN port to 192.168.1.xxx and then connect this camera to your computer's lan port.
