{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Bushnell X8 Works Great Day and Night", "Author": "mdrewhall", "ReviewID": "R12CBGHWAXWG6C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the Bushnell X-8 trail camera in the field for a month and I couldn't be more pleased with the results. It's on a trailhead with approximately 15 feet of space before a corn field begins. I knew the deer were using this trail because of the amount of corn which was eaten off the stalks and their tracks. I just couldn't wait to get this camera on the tree and see what bucks might be visiting on opening morning of bow season.When I initially set the camera up I placed it on Field Scan mode to automatically take a 3-photo-burst every two minutes for the last hour and half of day light. During the time it was on Field Scan mode for more than 3 weeks the Bushnell X-8 took more than 2,000 photos and with most of them being on Field Scan mode during the day time. During the first week of testing I got almost no PIR (Passive Infrared) photos. I thought maybe there were no deer at all using the area, but then I had a few deer caught on the Field Scan mode, so that couldn't have been the case.After re-examining the instruction manual, I found the PIR sensor is adjustable. The manual says:When setting up the camera to capture images of wildlife on hot summer days, it can be more difficult for the sensor to detect the temperature difference between animals and their surroundings. Setting the sensitivity switch to \"H\" can help, since it makes the PIR more sensitive to small differences in temperature. The opposite is also true-setting the switch to \"L\" can help prevent false or too frequent triggers during the low ambient temperatures of winter. And \"M\" (medium) is a good setting for moderate fall and spring temperatures.Following the PIR settings readjustments and putting it back on the tree, the camera captured numerous photos of deer and other wildlife as soon as they entered the detection zone. It was great to see that a simple switch adjustment would make all the difference in the world. The best part about it was during the testing I was only using 4 alkaline AA batteries and the camera will accept up to 8 lithium AA for maximum battery life. After a month in the field taking more than 2,000 photos and about 25 videos as well, the battery bar had not moved from full.After seeing the Field Scan mode and PIR photo mode worked well at both day and night, it was time to test out the video mode. I wasn't even aware it would take videos at night, until I pulled the card the first time; but it really does a great job. You can tell so much more about the deer when they are moving in the video, than in a still photo. It could definitely make the difference in distinguishing a shooter buck from a non-shooter even with the excellent image quality. Seeing how different deer move and react will allow hunters to more accurately identify deer while in the stand.If you are having second thoughts about which trail camera to buy, you can't go wrong with this one. It's tiny, takes great photos and videos, and is simple to set up. Add in the fact that it has a 9-month battery life on eight lithium AA batteries taking up to 30 photos a day, and I'm sold. To see the instruction manual on the Bushnell X-8 trail camera see Bushnell's web site.Sample videos:[...]", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "X-8 as Security", "Author": "Lawrence M Crutcher", "ReviewID": "R1LCL8HGMDHFZO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First the good. The size, price, storage capacity, and image quality add up to good value. The date and time display is very clear. Then the less-than-perfect. Although an American company and product, the manual appears to have been prepared by an ESL writer. The controls and display remind one of an early cell phone, which, combined with the unclear manual, make set-up a small challenge. Sadly, the controls on my unit froze up upon the third adjustment, and I had to return it as unusable. There is a feature, possibly designed to help farmers watch their corn grow, of taking one picture every-so-many minutes, perhaps also to save on storage. On my unit it would not turn off. My goal was to photo intruders on property, similar to the original purpose of photoing wildlife. But the time-sequence lock, permitting one picture only every-so-many-minutes, meant that the subject could slip in and out of range without being photo'd. The nighttime images were okay, distinguishable, but nowhere near as good as the excellent daytime images.", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great  value, good pics", "Author": "Newbie DIYer \"Double D\"", "ReviewID": "R2A2UAM1VA89U4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera to determine from which direction animals are coming in to your food plot or bait. You can set it up to take a photo every minute for hours close to feeding times. I have had mine set up for three months on the same batteries, a big plus. It's nice and small and easily attached with the supplied strap. An excellent hunting aid and would recommend this to all deer hunters especially. Would advise to get a 32gb card. It will save thousands of pics. Only thing not liked is the color. I don't know why most manufacturers make these things out of shiny green plastic. They need to be a matte gray color to blend in with tree bark and to discourage thieves.", "Date": "March 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good for the price!", "Author": "Zigs", "ReviewID": "R1IKHAKTHAG9MA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this just to put by our 2 ponds and it works great.

Hayes \"BHP\"", "ReviewID": "R4PHZAVVOL3WQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The name \"x-8\" gives an initial impression this is an 8 megapixel camera, however reading the product description it states it is a 6 megapixel camera. This is not the case... I bought this to take photos of wildlife in my backyard. When viewing the images I noticed that the 6 megapixel setting seemed to be \"grainy\" and not as clear as my 3.2 megapixel cell phone. After reading the Instruction Manual that came with the unit it states that the camera sensor is only a 2 megapixel sensor. The 4 and 6 megapixel images are created via interpolation which is a \"smoke and mirrors\" technique for the software to generate a higher resolution image. However it is not a \"true\" resolution. Just like the difference between \"optical and digital\" zoom on video recorders. Optical is the \"true\" zoom and digital is a larger image generated by the programming. Just be aware when you buy this \"6\" megapixel camera you are actually buying a 2 megapixel sensor.", "Date": "July 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Critters 'n Crooks", "Author": "MrEd \"Mr Ed\"", "ReviewID": "RD0HBS2HDJ0UQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Using it to discover what and when critters are trying to get my chickens,  and what  and when crooks are coming into my yard to \"liberate\"  gas stored for emergencies and for my boat.

My only complaint is (1) that there is not a delete button, only an all or nothing option after viewing and (2)there was no view-finder. I soon discovered that the camera really doesn't need it a view-finder. We fenced a few acres of a new rural property in MA so that our six dogs could run free while we're outside, but when we let them out in the evenings they've been running up through the woods to a certain spot at the fence and barking...so we sat the camera on a rock, set it on video (which gives you 10 second clips at a time) and -- wow! -- the next morning we watched about 80 short clips of a red fox, a fisher, and later on a coyote! Just guessing, but I'd say the camera captures everything right in front of it to a distance and width of about 20ft. and the sensor is tripped up to 40'.

I have captured 3 short videos. 1 video the coyote came in to eat the bait but the infrared glow scared it off. The placement of where he appeared in the in the video it was obvious he had walked into the cameras field of vision about 10 feet before it registered a life form. I have had nights where all the bait has disappeared and I don't have a photo or video to show for it. I have bought a Bone Collector Trail Camera (it's in the mail) on a recommendation of a friend who has had very good results and big differences in test runs with his other cameras on the same tree and covering the exact area. The X-8 did catch a couple of open shots with nothing in them, I am guessing the trees about 35 feet away moved just enough in the wind to trigger the photo. The web belt for attaching the device to a tree has some issues as well, such as it will not tighten very tight to keep camera in place. The only reason I gave it a 2 rating is because I did get those 3 videos over a weeks worth of trial and error. I was wondering if the lack of photo captures are because smaller animals are coming in such as Raccoons or Cats. I will have to test it on my cats someday when I have more time Make sure you set this up very close to home for the learning curve or you will be VERY DISPPOINTED.
