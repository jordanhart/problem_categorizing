IR is OK, I supplement mine with wall mounted IR lights. The only bad thing about the 'bubble' is that it reflects it's own IR light back into the camera causing a halo - so night video isn't wonderful, but you can see. Mount it at a height that you can clean the globe; it'll need it after every rain.", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent enough", "Author": "Christopher Guarino", "ReviewID": "R23LLYG3W2MO75", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First and foremost, the zoom is 2x. Not 3. I measured it by zooming in on a ruler. The image quality is ok. Not great, but decent. As others have said, it needs to be mounted very high or at an angle. Mine is mounted 15 feet above the ground, and my home is at the top of a small hill, and I would say it is at a bare minimum for visibility. There is also a little more IR feedback when in night mode than I would prefer, as a result of the IR LEDs reflecting off the dome housing.Other than these issues, it's a great camera. I have it wired directly into the router via ethernet cable and the responsiveness is great. I also tested it with a powerline adapter (from a Logitech Alert system) and it worked almost as well. It was slightly less responsive. The position for the camera is far enough away from my router (20 feet or so, through 2 floors and 3 walls) that wifi was not a reliable option. When connected via wifi in that location, it worked about 50% of the time. It pans, tilts, and zooms, as commanded. It functions well with Blue Iris software, and generally gets the job done. For the price, I'd say it's a good buy, as long as the three aforementioned issues aren't a problem for you. Anything that is going to have all these features and not any of these issues is going to cost considerably more, though, so I'd say it's really a question of priorities.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "E.

Martin \"dzldan\"", "ReviewID": "RE71HB90FICXL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One small problem with this camera. The presets do not work for the zoom feature, only pan and tilt. Kind of bad for security purposes when patrolling at night if you wanted a closer look. All the presets have to be the same zoom level.This camera does have presets (10) by the way. No where does it mention that.More info after first night of using with the IR. Because there is no zoom on the presets, I have the camera set to view at max 3x power. But when the lens is all the way back, the glare on the doom is pretty bad. Almost unusable. In fact for my purpose it is useless. Only way around it is to put up IR illuminators up and cover the IRs on the camera. Too bad, had a lot of promise on this puppy.I bought 2 of them, both went back, sorry IPCC.", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Okay but...", "Author": "Barry Zimmerman", "ReviewID": "RO6ZCGNMBVMMH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Relatively easy to get set up wirelessly but the control panel needs work and also the view needs to be tweaked.The control panel has controls to close so if you use an IPad or touchscreen, you might hit something you don't want to select, also, the pan control works the opposite in safari and chrome browser which also does not support zoom. IE does work fine. The view never goes up to looking straight out at 90 degrees, it is more like 70 to 75 so you are always looking downward from where the camera is mounted.ive had to mount the camera on an up angle to get a tree line view. Support is from china so there are translation issues and time differences for responses.
