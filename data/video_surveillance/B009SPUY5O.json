Crane", "ReviewID": "RHZR8QQEP93Q4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this system, but please read the specifications and other owner comments carefully so you know what you're getting.Prices vary, as even Amazon had this same base station and two daytime camera deal for a much better price recently.  Bought mine at Costco when it went on sale for $140 for the package of base and 2 cameras, including a free year of Elite monitoring storage.This is a wireless system, with the base plugging into your router.  Set-up of base and cameras was easy.  Since cameras are wireless, there are no wires to link, just stick them up wherever you want.  This allows tremendous flexibility in placement  Communication by browser or app (phone, iPad) easily established, allowing real time viewing through camera.  Each camera can be set individually to sense motion and then record either still or video images of your choice of quality and speed.  I enable the cameras when I leave the house using my smartphone.  If they detect motion, an email will be sent to you (you name each camera, so you will know which detected the motion).High def still images take time to record and will be blurred, so by trial and error, I found that using the video images provided more recognizable photos of anyone tripping the camera.  These are saved on-line and are retrievable if the police require them at a later time.  The motion sensors worked well for me, but need to be positioned just right so as not to be triggered by pets walking into the view zone (which has limited adjustment).  The video/still image quality is only adequate, but you can buy higher definition security camera systems if you want to pay a much higher price.  These higher definition systems all require hard wiring (easy to do if you have raised ceilings in a business, but difficult at home).Please note that these are available light (daytime) cameras.  If you wish coverage for dark areas, then you will need to purchase the night vision cameras which come with their own infrared light source (the source needs to be plugged into an outlet).  If you will be placing the camera in an unprotected outdoor location, you will need to invest in a weather cover.Note that these cameras don't fit in with your existing security system, but will run parallel to it.  That's fine with me and saves considerable money.  My existing security has portal, motion, and heat detectors that will trigger a monitored alarm and call authorities.  The NetGear wireless system just allows me to monitor the house and provide image identification for the police later.  The monitoring company does not have access to my video feeds for privacy.Because I looked for these items on sale, my overall outlay for the base, two daytime and two night vision cameras came to just over $300, far cheaper than any competing system and performs adequately for my needs.  If your needs are different, then consider the more expensive systems with expensive live monitoring.", "Date": "May 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Simple and easy surveillance system", "Author": "chris moorhead", "ReviewID": "R2R0BX2ZDCR0S7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Simple and easy to install.

What would be a bonus would be ease of use and a way to view the video from a portable device without a lot of configuration.  In comes the Netgear Vuezone camera system.  First you get a wireless base station that you plug into your router with a standard ethernet cable and plug into an AC/DC adapter.  That's the extent of cords for this setup, just the base station.  The camera's are battery powered and mounted on a magnetic base with a sticker on the back.  If where you want to put the camera on a non-sticky-helpful surface, a simple screw into a drywall anchor easily solves this problem.  Then you make a vuezone account, and download the vuezone app to your android and iOS devices, and you have a quick and easy to setup video camera solution.  After two days of use, I'm sold, it does exactly what it says it does and has saved the day at least one time in the last 3 days since it's been installed.  The best part, when I'm done using it where it's at now, I can simply just move it.  They also make a night-vision camera and a outdoor version of the camera as well.  The free plan I'm using for netgear gives me access to two cameras anywhere on the internet.  It's a great little product, the only addition I'm making to the setup is rechargeable batteries for the camera as I like rechargeable batteries more than anything in the world.\ufeff", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love them", "Author": "Misty", "ReviewID": "R24V0K1XTRH9NR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love these cameras I can see what my teenagers are doing while i'm away and feel safe knowing if someone brakes in I can catch them on camera", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great system for the price.........", "Author": "Al Callender", "ReviewID": "R3KZZV8YMFOXN8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera system is absolutely perfect for the price.
