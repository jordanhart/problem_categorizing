These are just the right mix of useful, yet unobtrusive.  You do have to be a bit careful placing them to make sure they cover the areas you want to show.  I have two on ceilings, and three high up on walls.  I would recommend you test the coverage by holding them in place before you actually drill holes if possible.  I did that by running the cable over the floor to the DVR first.  The nearly 360 degree swivel makes pointing them easy.  The IR LEDs really throw the light at night, but you don't know it except when you check on your monitor.  This dude gets 5 stars.", "Date": "October 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice", "Author": "E. D.

Revo sells an RJ12 to power/BNC balun, but there is no version of that with audio.  A call to their tech support confirms that the camera does indeed have audio, but they have no way to output that to normal audio jacks.  I suppose they only want you to have audio if you're using a complete Revo system.  Other than that, the cameras have a decent picture.  They really need to put on some standard plugs though.. why on earth should someone have to buy an adapter when every other security camera on the market has standard plugs??", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great condition!", "Author": "Lyanna Benner", "ReviewID": "R1WJUM5TW3COWS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It came with cable,however this was not in the description.

I bought this camera as an upgrade because it offers more resolution (600 TVL) and it has an ICR cut filter. I'm really impressed with how accurate the colors reproduction is under different lighting conditions. Excellent video quality in both day and night mode. Also the design is pretty sleek and unique.
