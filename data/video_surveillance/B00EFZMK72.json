I like the adjustment screw but it seems like it\u2019s going to brake before you get it to the desired view. Although the picture was nice I switched the camera out and the second one looked a litter clearer. I would recommend this camera for someone that needs a general view, if you\u2019re looking for precision keep looking.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great dome camera", "Author": "RICH MILLER", "ReviewID": "R3E3LHU2XL9F02", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great color dome IR camera for the price, we have ordered others at a higher price and they didn't preform any better!", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EFZMK72"}}
