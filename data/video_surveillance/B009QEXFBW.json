{"Reviews": [{"Title": "For the money this is a great camera. Well made solid aluminum not junk plastic", "Author": "Michelle", "ReviewID": "R1E75W1WIOYNAP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We just recieved the cameras. We bought 3 of them. At this price they just couldn't be better. Very surprised at the quality. They are a video only cam which is just fine for our needs. Very clear and they even come with a power supply. That alone will cost you over 10 bucks. There is a set of 2 RCA adapters to hook in to your equipment as well. I had questions about the product and my response was sent within an hour. What more could you ask. Great product, great price, great customer service. If you are looking for a video camera system this is a great starter for you.", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009QEXFBW"}}
