I like the easy setup using dedicated switches instead of software function programing. Specs calls for trigger at 30 feet max range. The night photos are not well illuminated beyond 10 feet from camera. The daylight shots are fantastic. I was happy with this unit and needed another camera, so I upgraded to the Primos Truth cam 46. It cost more money and performance was not as good as Truth cam 35. Sent the Truth cam 46 back and ordered another Truth Cam 35. Happy with both Truth Cams 35. The video mode does eat up SD card space so I switched over to the 5 shot photo feature with 1 second delay between shots. uses a lot less card space and sharp photos. By the way the specs say 8 GB (SD HC MAX SIZE) My two Truth cams 35 accepted 16 GB SDHC and seems to work fine. I would have given the camera 5 stars, but the distance of the night photos beyond 10 feet were a little disapointing.", "Date": "September 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "onin24eagle", "ReviewID": "R3D3CBZAJ5DVG9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have several scouting cameras from a variety of manufacturers.  My favorite is by far the Reconyx, but I just can't shell out that kind of money if I want more cameras.  As much as I love that camera, I almost wish I had taken that money and bought 8 Truth Cams so I could cover more ground.  Almost.  Right now, I think this is the best value of any of the cameras I have.For the money this is a great camera.  It easily performs as well as some $200 cameras out there.  My Reconyx takes better night pictures, and more of them, but I also spent a lot more money on that camera, almost 10x more.Some pictures are a little blurry at night if the deer are moving fast, but it's really not that bad.  You can still clearly make out the number of points on the antlers unlike the Moultrie camera that I have which just shows a white blur.Daytime photos are awesome.Couple of things to be aware of:If you put it in the woods with a heavy overhead canopy, you will occasionally get white out photos.  This camera is much better suited for more open areas such as fields or food plots.  When I put it on the edge of a field, I do not get white outs.  Also, if you do place it in thicker cover, don't set the sensitivity on high.  You'll get lots of great pictures of trees.  Every time a branch moves it will go off.  Nighttime flash range is much better in open areas as well.I've had it out in the field now for 2 weeks.  It's already taken over 500 photos and the battery is at 98%.  I'm using industrial D-Cell batteries that I special ordered so I expect them to last longer so take that with a grain of salt.I can't give it 5 stars though.  A Reconyx is a 5 star camera.  This is not a Reconyx.  Compared to one of those it's probably a 2 or 3 star camera at best.  However, considering the performance/price ratio, it gets a 4.  It is NOT the best camera out there, but it IS the best camera if you're on a tight budget.", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "Big Al", "ReviewID": "R38XTQDIO1270E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this item thru Amazon.

It was simple to setup.  I placed it in the field on 09-26-10, and set it to take 3 photos every minute.  I retrieved the camera from the field on 10-03-10.  It took 6,542 photos (day and night) of deer, ferrel hogs, squirrels, and racoons on an 8GB SD card, with 70% battery life remaining.  Of these photos very very few were of small game. There were hardly any blank photos, if any.  The night time IR photos were clear, except some blur did occur on some of the photos, if the game was moving during the shot. The wildlife did not seem to mind the night IR LED's.  I did not notice where it ever startled them, though sometmes they would look directly at the red LED's. A few photos were a little dark during the transition time between dark and light in the morning and between light and dark in the evening, but this was minimal, maybe 2-3 minutes worth. Overall the picture quality was very good, however the daytime pictures were all mono-chrome (not in color).  I emailed Primos with a sample photo and they told me the camera was faulty and that it needed to be replaced.  The Amazon transaction was seemless and smooth.  Amazon sent me another Truth Cam 35 even before they received my return.  I tested out the replacement just to be sure that it worked correctly before I place it in the field.  It worked great and the outside daytime pictures were in color like they should be.  The daytime colors seem really good. I'm looking forward to getting the camera back into the field this weekend, so I can get some really great color photos of the wildlife. I would recommend the Truth Cam 35 and I would buy it again.", "Date": "October 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Worked well at first. Bad warranty service.", "Author": "J. L.

Camera", "Author": "Charles Stirens", "ReviewID": "RW8L3ZOSP4PTT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this to take pictures at night of my front deck. It worked great right out of the box, the instructions were simple and easy to understand, and the controls are very user friendly. The daylight pictures are crisp, clear, and in color. The night pictures are black and white due to the infrared. The down side was that the camera requires an SD card (that must be placed in a different devise to view the pictures) and four D batteries (both of which are not included).  The big thing was that after about a week the night pictures became dark and very difficult to see anything, but occasionally one would come out clear. I accepted the night picture quality considering that the daylight pictures were as good as any digital camera could be and the other features were ok.  Where this camera really failed me was the one night that I needed to know what activity was on my deck, the file that had the pictures somehow got an error and could not be opened. I thought this was just a freak error, but two days later the same thing happened. I called Primos and was told they would replace the camera with an updated version, the only thing is that I have to pay to ship it to them.  After I sent it in I had checked their website and it stated they were out of stock and would be sent when the shipment came in. I called and was told that they did have them and that it would be sent out that day, but that it would be an identical model unless I was willing to pay for an upgrade. It did arrive in two days, but it would not work at all. I put in the batteries and the SD card and turned it on but could not set the time or date. When I called customer service to let them know what issues I was having, and that apparently this one was a reconditioned unit because the package had been opened, I was told that it was tested before it was shipped (which seemed odd because it did not work). They did send me a return label this time so I did not have to pay for shipping.  Just like the first time, I waited long enough for them to receive it and called to verify and to get an idea of how long it would be before I could expect to have it sent back, and once again I was told that it would ship out that day. After a week, I had not received it I called again, only this time I asked to talk with the supervisor of customer service. I had to leave a message and several hours later Jimmy Primos himself called me back. I explained the issues I had encountered with both of the cameras and how I felt that the customer service people had repeatedly gave false information. He assured me that he would resolve the issue and call me back. Well, about 15 minutes later the customer service representative called me back, not Jimmy. She was very defensive and spoke as if I was to blame for all of the problems I had with the cameras.  I have receive the second replacement camera and it has been operating for about a week, but the first one worked good for a short time also. Bottom line is; I paid $81.00 for the camera, $12.00 shipping, $6.00 batteries, $10.00 SD card, $12.00 return shipping, so I have over $120.00 invested in this game cam that, more than likely, will not last very long. I can only base my experience with this company on this one product, but if it is this much of a problem with their base model, I could only imagine how their other products really are. One thing is for sure, I will not be buying any other Primos products.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not bad....But not great either.", "Author": "deputy2002", "ReviewID": "RA2GLNJONVXA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Cons: I have had a little bit of trouble downloading all of my pictures. I generally go to my camera and just swipe out memory cards. I then use my digital camera to download them onto my computer. About every other picture my software indicates that I have an unrecognizable format and it will not bring the pictures up to a full view. I can however see them in the preview screen of all the photos. I have noticed that the pictures which are indicated as unrecognizable format have a white out area in place of where the moon phase, time and date should be. This is not a major problem since I can still see the photos in a smaller preview of all the photos together. However it is aggervating. I have not noticed any other reviews stating this as a problem so it could be my software. I dont believe it is though since I can clearly see the white out area in the bottom of the screen where the time and date should be.The only other complaint that I have is nicht pictures are not as good as I was hoping for. I see photos of deer on the review page of amazon which appear to be 20-30 yards away and the pictures appear clear. I however have noticed that any deer outside of 10 yards is blurry and it is very difficult to make out how big the deer actually is.Pros: I have only had the camera out since the first of december. It has been pretty cold here in southern Illinois and the battery life still shows 60%. I think this is pretty damn good considering the wheather. I am hoping that in the warmer months it will last for months at a time.The day time photos I have are fantastic. Crystal Clear out 50 yards and beyond. I say beyond because 50 yards is the furthest I have had a deer away from the camera. I thought it was pretty impressive that the cameras sensor picked the deer up and it was also a crystal clear image.I have tested the trigger time in my house and in the woods. It is lightning fast at room temp.(less than a second)I have noticed that the cold wheater seems to slow it down a little bit but it still seems pretty fast.(less than 2 seconds) Once agian I think this is pretty impressive for the cold wheather.The click everyone talks about is not very noticable and it has not spooked any deer thus far. I have not used the video mode so I cannot comment on the effectiveness of the mode.I plan on purchasing a couple of more of these cameras since they appear to be dirt cheap compared to others on the market.", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Find out what's in your yard at night.", "Author": "D. Thompson", "ReviewID": "R2ON1AI0V9EIIP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera has given me a good idea of what goes on in my back yard at night (lots of rabbits, a coyote and a stray dog).  I don't need it for daytime photos but since I can't switch off daytime photos, I just have to delete them later.Note that the daytime shots are 3.1 megapixels whereas the nightime IR shots are 1.3MP.  This makes the night shots grainy.  However, since I was looking for what was on my lawn, not for shots to show people, it is sufficient.The manual says that the IR detector detects both motion (as with your flootlight motion detector) and heat.  But both are not required as motion alone will trigger photos, like blowing branches.  For night shots, both the medium and sensitive settings are triggered by motion outside the range of the photo.  However, I keep it at medium as the low setting results in few photos.The night lighting is made by an array of IR leds which illuminate about 20' range as can be seen in the photos as light on the lawn.  For some reason this lighted area is not seen if the camera is put into Video mode, and the videos seem to be much darker than the stills.  I can only see the eye-reflections of the bunnies, whereas the still show the bunnies.I would say the ideal application of this camera is by a trail where the target will pass by within 10'.Another thing I've noticed is that at night the the illuminating IR leds are partially in the visible red, i.e. when you walk by and trigger the photos, you can see the led array glowing red.  My dog seems to notice it (though it could have been the camera she noticed).The four D batteries last for thousands of still pictures in cool winter.UPDATE:  Lasted 6 months.

We started with the CAM35, liked it, and decided to get the higher resolution CAM60. Have not owned any other trail cams so we can't make comparisons.Our property abuts a wooded area and we set up the cameras in various locations to see what was going on in the area, mostly around several nearby woodchuck holes. The cameras are weather tight and survived many rainstorms (we didn't get to try them in extreme cold). The CAM35 is a bit easier to manage on setup since the paramerters are set with slide switches. The CAM60 has an illuminated screen and you have to scroll thru a menu to change settings. On a bright day that can be a little frustrating, but not fatal.We got stills and videos of lots of wildlife: chucks, possums, weasels, rabbit, deer, birds, mice, skunk, squirrels, chipmunks, a cat, racoons,... the usual suspects. (Our niece and nephew really enjoyed the animal antics that we captured.)Problem: The Cam35 unit started to write bad files after about 10 months. We tried several SD cards with the same result. We contacted Primos' support and they were very helpful. After emailing them a short video file that would not play they determined that the camera was at fault (a rare occurrence, according to their tech) and offered to swap it with a good one. The replacement is up and running fine. Kudos to Primos' staff and to their support of their products!TIP: One caution re the SD cards. I created numerous folders on a few of my SD cards in order to save interesting videos, deleting the rest. I continued to use these cards but found, after a while, that the CAM60 wouldn't record, thinking the SD card was full. Turns out that the card became fragmented with all the deletions and re-recordings.

The camera might be triggered by so little as some weeds blowing in the wind.2.) Water got inside the case, including the memory card area, after a heavy rainstorm.  I dried out the camera for a few days, verified that it was working again, and put stick-on weatherstripping around the inside seal of the door and the outside seals where the case comes together.  No problem so far with rain getting inside after the fix.  You can buy the weatherstripping tape at a place like Home Depot for a few dollars.All in all, I think this camera is a good value for what is supplied.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "SD Full  Buyer Beware!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Aaron", "ReviewID": "R3JUZEWBYVNSTT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you are interested in purchasing this truth cam 35 I would advise against it.

So I did a little research about this issue and it seems to be very common with quite a few of the Primos line of game cams.  So I called Primos and told the rep what was happening and gave her my serial number to the cam and was told that it was just out of warranty and that I could send it in for repair at my own cost.  So I played along and ask, how much and she could not give me an answer knowing damn well what the issue was because it is common problem.  So I brought this to her attention and all I heard on the other end of the line was silence and then a lot of stuttering and then more silence and then some ah ah ah I am sorry sir.

The night videos were surprisingly clear, allowing us to see what was drinking the hummingbird nectar at night (raccoons).  The daylight video was also of good quality and allowed me to capture lots of action at our bird feeders.Unfortunately, the camera started to malfunction after the first few weeks.  It now only works intermittently.  It's still great when it works, but that is only about half the time.  I contacted the company's customer service through their website to request help.  I received a reply within an hour requesting more information, followed by an email saying that I would be contacted with further instructions.  That was over a month ago.

Decided on the cheapest one for a trial. The 35' range is true! You get every bit of that on the most sensitive setting. Have had a couple \"whiteouts\" out of 100's of pics. Camera is in heavy woods with dappled bright sun. Deer seem to notice the camera (shutter click?) but don't appear particularly alarmed, just curious and sometimes looking at the camera.

Anderson \"kfander\"", "ReviewID": "RORSGK8HAFEAO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had a Primos Truth Cam 35 in the woods on my one hundred acres in northern Maine since early May of 2011, before the snow melted. For the money, it is an excellent buy and, although my experience has been limited to the Primos line of wildlife cameras, I expect that it would compare well to far more expensive cameras. Although the resolution is limited to 3.0 MP, the photos are nevertheless clear enough for me to be proud to post them on petramainewildlife.com. I also have a Primos Truth Cam 46, with a 5.0 MP resolution, and it's a great camera as well, but I think the Truth Cam 35 produces photos as good as the slightly more expensive 46 model. I consider the audible click to be a plus, and I prefer the switch settings on the Truth Cam 35 to the software settings on the Truth Cam 46.When I first put my camera out in the woods, I looked at the weather reports and learned that the forecast was for seven straight days of freezing rain and sleet. At first, I considered retrieving my camera, for fear that it would be harmed, then decided that this was as good a time as any to try out the warranty. Not only did the camera survive, but it took good photos during this time. The first wild animal to appear on camera showed up on the same day that I mounted the camera to a tree, and it was a Maine black bear, who then laid down to take a nap in front of the camera at 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon. We have had a very wet spring, summer and fall here in Maine, and my camera has been out in the woods the whole time. I did start seeing some washed out pictures only a couple of weeks ago, near the end of the photo season in northern Maine, as my land is not accessible during the winter except by snowmobile or snowshoes. I wrote to Primos and they instructed me to send it back, while they sent me a replacement, so it's clear that they stand by their warranty.I have read some reviews from customers complaining that the Primos Truth Cam 35 produced an audible click while it was taking still photos, which some claimed would spook the wildlife. On the contrary, I have found that the slight audible noise that it does make simply gets the animal's attention and prompts it to look in the direction of the camera or even to come in for a closer look. Black bears have tried to maul my camera four times, the lens has been smudged, at different times, by a bear and a moose who were intrigued by the camera, and a black bear used my camera as a backscratcher once while it was in video mode. These made for some amusing photos and video, but my camera was not harmed. My camera has caught photos and video of at least four different black bears, several moose, some white-tailed deer, racoons, rabbits and a large cat which, unfortunately, wasn't close enough for me to identify. Only the white-tailed deer appeared to have been startled by the camera and that was when she came upon a small clearing in the middle of a cedar swamp at 10:00 o'clock at night to encounter a camera flash along with I would presume, the audible click that concerns some people. From the photos, the deer was obviously startled. Still, she stared at the camera for quite awhile, then began grazing. She would look up at the camera periodically, but certainly wasn't spooked. The camera is sensitive enough to be activated by a bird, although there is an option to lower the sensitivity.By next spring, I hope to have at least four cameras in the woods, and at least two of them will be Truth Cam 35s, while I may also try out one of their higher end models. I recommend the Truth Cam 35 highly.Added on January 23, 2012: Having used my Primos Truth Cam 35 since early spring, and my Primos Truth Cam 46 since mid-summer, my experience is that the Truth Cam 35 takes far better night photos than the more expensive Truth Cam 46 model, while the day photos taken by the Truth Cam 46 are slightly better than those from the Truth Cam 35, given the higher megapixel capacity. Given this, as well as the simplicity of the Truth Cam 35, I would buy another Truth Cam 35 camera, but I probably wouldn't buy another Truth Cam 46, although both are good cameras.

Not being a hunter, I looked at multiple websites, reading reviews from those who were in a better position to judge the quality of a game camera.  This Primos Truth Cam 35 appeared to be the easiest to operate and received very good reviews on every website on which it was offered.  Amazon's price was the least expensive and able to ship overnight. The Primos.com website provided a setup video, which was easy to follow.  It took longer to decide where to place the camera than it did to get it operational.  Daytime photos were as good as a digital camera with very good color and clarity.  I was pleased to see there was no bright flash at night when a photo was taken, but the panel of red lights that were activated anytime the infra-red beam was broken by objects within 40 feet of the camera made it easy for two-legged night creatures to spot and a more obscure hiding place needed to be found. The camera took black and white photos of vehicles and creatures at night that were much farther away than 40 feet.  While they were in the frame, they were captured too far from the center of the photo, making it impossible to make out detail needed for an identification.  Any object captured within the recommended 40 feet certainly was recognizable at night. I'm going to reposition the camera so the red night flash panel is visible in an effort to thrawt would-be trouble makers.  I've used a black, plastic coated heavy wire bicycle key lock to secure the camera to a large tree in direct view of the house.  Primos offers a metal lock box on Amazon for this camera, which actual hunters would probably find useful when placing this camera out in the woods for long periods of time.  The websites advertising this camera state it takes a 8GB SD card, but these cameras now can take up to a 36GB SD card.  I've only had this camera for two days, so cannot comment on the battery life, but it's possible the short battery life on first use commented on by others is because the internal battery that maintains the correct time and date setting initially uses the 4 D-Cell batteries provided by the purchaser to charge-up the internal battery.  This is an excellent camera for those looking for an inexpensive way to provide additional property security.

They do what they are supposed to and could be improved slightly to become perfect. The clunk you hear about in some reviews is either fixed or a non issue on all my cams.It is so faint you can barely make it out when you are less than a foot from the cam. The daytime videos are awesome but at night the IR and vids isn't always a good combination especially on black hogs. You just see a bunch of eyes on many vids and then some are illuminated properly. I suspect the IR and video function draws too much power at once and doesn't illuminate sufficiently for video. If I added the Primos Steroid pack or used rechargables maybe it would help. My favorite setting is on a 3pic burst with ten seconds between. I should stress that the color and IR pics are fantastic. I have had up to 3500 pics in a week with hogs hitting a feeder. You can roll through your pics fast on a laptop and it looks like a video anyway. Battery life is more than acceptable given the massive amounts of video and pictures I have been getting. After a full month I still have 50% battery life on my most active unit. The video function draws a lot more power and the first two weeks that's the mode I ran them in. It does have trouble under a canopy at first or last light deciding on IR or color but that's no problem for me. You can CLEARLY see what you have and thats all I want anyway. For the money I'd buy this one again and actually like better than the 46 because its easier to set up. The 46 is an awesome cam too though.

They will pay!These cams have been very valuable to me in hog control as I know the age structure of the hogs I have and which ones I should target to help control their high reproductive capacity. It is a shame they are so destructive as I admire some of their other characteristics.I would have given these 5 stars if it weren't for the IR video problem but it is still a great tool well worth the money. Honestly I feel they are more like a 4.5 to 4.75 star product but I know some buyers are more particular about these cams and would cry about an inaccurate review if I didn't mention the IR vids. These are well worth the money in my opinion.I shouldn't leave out Amazon either, they are awesome and shipping was next day for a small upcharge so I got to start surveiling my hogs right away.

Excellent battery life. Decent quality pictures night and day. Easy to set up and use.Cons: Rather large and heavy. Very narrow field of view, will only take pictures when an animal is directly in front of the camera. Does make a little noise. Not super sensitive.This year we set up several trail cams including this one and a Bushnell Trophy cam. This cam took maybe one picture to every 10 by the Bushnell. This is due to the Primos very narrow field of view. The question is do you really need 100 pictures every night when 10 or so would do fine. And considering the price is half that of the Bushnell, the camera is fine for most hunting situations. The camera also requires a second small lock to secure the switches and your memory card.Overall, a very economical camera for most situations. The cameras add new fun to the hunt by showing all the traffic around your stand. We all looked forward to pulling the cards every day to see what was in our area. The big ten point we got pictures of really motivated everyone at camp this year!Update: Used now for two seasons and still going strong. I also leave out in the back yard for weeks on end without a problem. Battery life is almost a year. Again, the field of view and delay allows the camera to only catch a few pictures.

The motion detection on photos and video is good. Two D cell batteries seem to last weeks on casual use. We use it at home for capturing nocturnal animals...for fun, not for hunting.My only gripe at $77 is that the SD card is placed outside and at the bottom of the camera face where water can drip into it, protected only by a flimsy little rubber stopper. It should have obviously been contained inside the protected control panel area (and anyone can pop it out even if the camera is well secured against loss)!I purchased the $23 mount which is abit fiddly and has a narrow tree hugging footprint. It does offer a bit more swivel for awkward branches etc. and, well, at this price one can't grumble.

The Primos website is primarily a sales site with very limited product troubleshooting information so I haven't been able to determine if the camera will need to be sent back for repairs. There is a more subtle electrical issue with the remaining camera because it will not keep time on it's internal clock.

I set the unit sensitivity at norm, and for 3 stills with a 10s delay. The field of view was established in an area where vandalism of the lawn was ongoing; this was a particular problem with another model camera that failed to sense a wide and deep enough area. The Truth Cam 35 not only covers the area of interest, but much more often detecting movement on the other side of the street.At least 2 photos of casual passers-by are generated and typically 3 if they linger to trespass by permitting their animal to enter the lawn and relieve itself. The daylight photos are excellent providing time and date stamps (suitable for civil or criminal prosecution) and those taken after dark are also adequate to identify trespassers. The infrared lights are noticeable at night and probably have given pause to the nighttime trespassers as this activity seems to have discontinued altogether.Occasionally, cars speeding by will trigger the device and exit before they can be photographed, and I suspect that birds flying by probably do the same thing; however, this is a minor annoyance that simply generates blank photos of the area.  With a 2G SD card installed, hundreds of high resolution photos can be saved and quiclkly sorted through later.This camera may have been intended for entirely different purposes, but as a means of dissuading inconsiderate jerks who prefer to trespass and let their animals relieve themselves in someone else's lawn rather than their own, it is well worth the price.", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "It works great.", "Author": "Less Known \"Rancher\"", "ReviewID": "RZ0FKUOMNOFTU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wish I could attach photos taken by this camera.

Images are good. I liked it well enough that I recently bought a second one.When I was cleaning my first camera (year old) this weekend the plastic white cover over the electric eye crumbled. I was using a damp cloth with gentle pressure to clean the camera a little before storing it for next season when it crumbled into 20 or more pieces.No problem I thought, probably happens all the time. It was very easy to open the back of the camera and remove the remains of the plastic cover with standard phillips screwdrivers; took maybe 3 minutes.I called Primos this morning to order a replacement cover and learned from the customer service rep that THEY DO NOT OFFER REPAIR PARTS! Primos was willing to swap out cameras with me IF it was still under warranty, but would not provide parts. Well, mine is out of warranty and ARE YOU KIDDING ME it would be really stupid for Primos to send me a new camera when all I need is a two-cent piece of plastic. The CSR I spoke with was cold and could only repeatedly say \"Primos does not repair\" and \"does not have parts\". She did offer to send me a new camera for $50. I asked her if Primos expected me to throw away my otherwise working $100 camera and buy a new one because the two-cent plastic dome was broken. She (predictably) repeated: \"Yes\", \"Primos does not repair\" and \"does not have parts\".I will not buy another Primos product and recomend that you consider this if service-after-the-sale is remotely important to you.[UPDATE] The Primos CSR called me back a few days later to tell me that they had searched for a replacement dome but were unable to locate one. She again offered to send me a new one [camera] for $50 which I declined. She then offered a replacement [camera] for $25 which I accepted. It arrived in the mail a couple of days later. I have not tested it yet.[UPDATE] I failed to mention in my first update, that it was the same CSR that called me back and she was much more pleasant and easy to deal with and, in fairness, I (we) all have our off days. The new camera is up and running and has recorded more than 800 photos with the same quality that I mentioned above. It is still a concern to me that they do not offer parts.

I bought the first one on a lark to capture the cats, squirrels and critters that run along my fence line, but it turns out to be an excellent security camera as well as a game camera. I have it pointed at the fence next to my house. On sensitive setting it will take a picture of the wind blowing the tree leaves, so I have it on \"Normal\" and it still captures creatures as small as little finch birds roosting on the boards.I love the range of settings - one picture, 3, or more, video or stills, and zoom function.The batteries seem to last forever. I have the same batteries as when I bought it 3 weeks ago, and it still reads over 95% charged. I also like the mounting options; there are grips on the back, belt loops, and screw holes. Several different options for securing to a surface or tree.The only drawbacks . . . the squirrel is pretty quick. Sometimes all he leaves is the wisps of his tail in the frame, as the camera is a bit slow to respond. Also, on foggy mornings dew can collect on the lens. These are minor points.The operation overall suggests it would be perfect as a security camera. Anyone trying to jump the fence would easily trigger the camera.The night vision photos are excellent too.Finally, I love the rugged construction.

Here's what I noted.  The camera itself works excellent.  In daylight it takes color pictures or videos and at night time, it takes black and white pictures or video.  If you are using the picture format, you can select that if it detects movement, it will take 1, 3 or 5 pictures in sequence and you can set the time frame between each picture taken.  For video, you can set how long you want it to take the video for.  The pictures come out brighter than the video but both are of high quality.  There are only two things I noticed negative with this camera.  The first is right at dusk or dawn, when it should be doing nighttime recording, it is on daytime recording so the pictures come out dark, but that occurs only over a short period of time before it switches to the appropriate day/night setting.  It seems like the daytime setting stays on too long at dusk and comes on too early at dawn making the pictures in that time period dark.  The second problem I noticed is that when the battery starts going down a bit, the pictures start getting darker.  I guess the infrared lights dim down as the battery voltage drops.  I guess that makes sense though.  In the one month I've had it, I've caught all sorts of animals both in photo and video.  I definitely would recommend this camera.  One final note.  When removing or installing the SD chip, be sure to use the rubber sealing piece to keep bugs out of the unit. If they get into the chip area and you push the chip in, the bug will get crushed and then the chip will not make contact to work.  I did have this happen to me but it was my fault for not closing the rubber sealing piece.  Luckily I was able to clean it out with a small eyeglass screwdriver.

A search of Mac forums on the Internet shows that people have had trouble with the internal SD reader on the portable. Visiting the TruthCam's site shows that people reading the cards with Windows computers indicates that there are problems there too, because the website advocates reformatting the SD cards frequently.I have just recently purchased a USB-based card reader, and it read correctly the cards that both my Mac and my TruthCam treated as unmountable or \"full.\" I'll keep watch for any problems. If using the USB reader is a reliable work-around, then I'll increase my rating for the TruthCam to four stars.--------As has happened with several other people, the unit I got functioned properly for one night. When I swapped out a new SanDisk memory stick, the same brand as the one I bought with this product, it said 0000 for a couple seconds and then flashed what looked like \"50ful\"-- which turned out to be \"SDFUL\", an indication that the unit reads new or reformatted SDHD memory sticks as \"full\" despite the fact that they have no files and are perfectly o.k. according to the computer that I read and reformat them with. (They can also accept files copied from my computer.)I like the unit. It seemed perfect for my purposes. But I have had to return the item to Amazon for replacement.The instructional booklet and the website make no mention of \"SDFUL,\" and the website has almost no useful information.Other people have given this game camera high ratings, but if you buy one you are taking a gamble. The package comes with instructions not to return the camera to the place you got it. If you depend on sending it to them, then you will pay shipping + $20 to have it repaired.Later:My replacement unit came very quickly. So far it works well except for messing up the directory files on the SDHD card. As the company's own website says, reinitializing SDHD cards needs to be done frequently. There is no good reason for this requirement. It clearly indicates unreliable functioning of the TruthCam's internal computer, i.e., the part of the gizmo that set up files and records into them. After I had used my original SDHD card a second time of the new TruthCam I was unable to erase and/or reinitialize the memory card. It originally told me that I had permission only to read my card. I rebooted my computer and inserted the SDHD again. This time I was told that it would need to be reinitialized. I did so, and the SDHD now seems to be o.k. -- until next time, perhaps.I've lowered my rating from a 3 to a 2 since both units I've attempted to use have had problems with recording images to the SDHD card.After having used this unit for many days, I am sorry to report that it has once again left an SDHD with a bad directory. I had to retry to get my Mac to reformat the disk several times. Each time the disk utility would only try to verify the disk. It then would say that the disk needed to be reformatted, but the \"reformat\" button was greyed out. I finally shut down my Mac, disconnected all external disks, and restarted. At that time I was given the option to \"repair disk.\" After the disk was repaired I went ahead and reformatted it to try to make sure that there were no lingering problems.It is possible that all units have this problem or that only units with minor imperfections will fail this way. Even their own website recommends frequently reformatting SDHD media, something that ordinarily would not be necessary.A couple of weeks later: I've learned that the internal SD card reader on Mac portables such as my MacBook Pro has a problem. If you get an inexpensive UBS reader for the SD cards, then the problems that I have had with TruCam will disappear.

After reading the reviews on Amazon.com and chasingame.com I settled on the Primos Truth cam 35.(78.03 at Amazon.com) I ran it all muzzleloader and gun season overlooking my food plot and this camera did not disappoint. The 4 D cell batteries lasted longer than I expected. dozens of pictures each day. The batteries lasted from early November to late December. The temperatures were extremely warm though, rarely getting below freezing all season. The pictures are good enough to determine what deer are patrolling your property but not Hi-resolution enough to pick out detail over more than 40 yards. The Infrared emitters didn't exactly reach out there but on a trail or in the woods made the grade. Don't expect much in a field or a food plot at night though. Trigger times are fast and this camera gets the job done in most situations. No problems with white-out or black-out pics at transition times.The camera did write a corrupt file to an SD card once ruining the pictures but has worked fine since, (this may have been a card fault). I placed it out after deer season and some budget batteries bit the dust after a week. I don't blame the camera though. I was slummin' it that week due to a small paycheck.I will follow up later with a long-term reliability report. Trail cameras offer lots of features at a good price point these days but few hold up.If small is what you are after better look somewhere else. This is a bigger camera.

For some reason, it seems the formatting between the two was an issue.  BUT I went out and bought an 8 GB SDHC card and I've only used it for this trail camera and I've not had any issues.  So I'd recommend only using a specific card for this camera to avoid any formatting issues from device to device.  Anyway, I've only had this camera out in my backyard (which is out in the woods) for a week and I've already captured photos of turkeys during the day and coyotes at night.  I've been more than happy with the quality of this camera.  A great value for the price and very simple to set up and see results from.  I can't wait to move this camera around to more spots and see even more wildlife!  The pictures come out very clear and colorful - and the date, temperature, time and moon phase stamps are awesome!  I would definitely recommend this camera to someone just starting out - this is a very good camera for the casual user.  I'm not very technically inclined so this was nice and easy to set up.  We are even thinking of purchasing a second camera for even more coverage in our area.

For fast moving animals this does not work so hot, but for game that is eating around a feeder, it should work fine. It will take images in 1, 3, or 5 round bursts, or video, but I really don't know how helpful the video would be vs. a 3 round burst shot. Seems to take images a few few seconds apart. There is a delay setting that pauses between shots and that is good. Downside, for me is, the camera seems near-sighted. Subjects standing only 20 feet away are out of focus, but up close, it's fine. The night time images seem fine for a camera in this price range. Flash works up to about 30 feet, but my camera sees the IR flash is over to the right hand side, not in the center. Images seem more clear in the IR mode than in the day light mode. IR images are 1.3 megapixel vs. daylight images that are 3.0 megapixel.The motion of trees and small animals is enough to set it off. It has a sensitivity setting that helps. The SD car slot is easy to remove, and reset on the camera, and all you need in the field to view the images is a laptop [PC or Mac], and a SD card reader, or camera with a SD card reader. The camera has a nice slot for a cable lock, and  MasterLock Python cable lock works great.I did not test the video mode, so I will not comment on it's function. Switches control the camera settings, and the whole thing is easy to set up date/time etc. About as hard as setting an alarm clock.

However, most all of these screens I have seen are small and have a low pixel count and the image is never going to be as clear on the trail camera as it will be on a computer monitor. My brother found a buck in the top right corner of his monitor while viewing images from his data card at home on his pc. He never did see the buck when he viewed the same frame on his trail camera's L.C.D. Some will say that the built-in screen helps with camera placement to take practice pictures. Well, if that makes you feel better thats good. Just know that the field of view of this Primos Truth camera is pretty wide and your going to get perfectly good pictures.Theft.Another reason I bought this camera. It's inexpensive.Camoflage.I wasn't impressed with other camera's trademarked camoflage schemes. In November, you can easily spot a camera that is camoflaged for spring Turkey season. You can also spot a camera that is comoflaged for regions other than where you will be hunting. I bought camoflage tape from my local farm store and used camo grease facepaint to perfect it.  The best part of using your own camoflage is that you can make it perfect for your area at the time of year you will use it. Remember this...... no matter how well you camoflage it, that olive drab strap around a tree is going to stand out like a sore thumb, so its very easy to spot a trail camera just by seeing that strap around a tree. Be clever, old rotted stumps have worked well for me, dig into the side of a little mound of dirt and place it upright, pack the dirt back around it and use whats laying around to conceal it. Felled rotten tree on the ground makes a good little hiding place with a little creative effort. Those L.E.D.'s? Go get some cheap dark window tint and cut out a piece to fit over them. If you're sneaky and keep your mouth shut, that camera will be very very hard for anyone to find.Practice:Practice makes better with trail cameras but never perfect.

(updated)", "Author": "Holyoak", "ReviewID": "R2NALX3M29DIPJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this for a 5 weeks now and went to collect the pic.s off it for the first time. So that others know what to expect I'll try and be complete in my description.  1st: The first thing that jumped out at me was the excellent picture quality both night and day. There seems to be a specific time of day when the camera can't figure out if it should be in night mode yet or not and so a few of the pictures it took were very dark. (not a critical issue in my opinion but it did cost it 1/2 a star)  2nd: The range and focus were impressive. I had a red tail hawk that spent 4 days hunting and in general posing in front of my camera. He perched on a limb just 12 inches in front of the camera and the detail on him was excellent. Both day and night shots of the deer both close up and at 35/40ish yards was also excellent. Moving or standing still it didn't matter.  3rd: Battery life: This is what cost the rating a full star. Again to be fair I've got the camera set to it's highest sensitivity and set to take cluster shots of 5 at a time so these do have an impact on battery life. BUT the camera took 325 pictures from 5/19 to 6/21 at these setting. When I arrived to swap out the memory card it was at 50% remaining battery life. These were four brand new out of the box D copper top Duracell's. Given how far you hunting grounds are from where you live and how accessible the area may be then this is something that can be a big deal. As hunting season gets closer I'm going to have to be very careful with this issue. I don't want my prey to become skidish because of numerous trips into my hunting area. I don't know if my expectations are a high but I thought I would get at least 3 months of battery life and 800 to 1000 pictures.  Lastly: Over all the construction and setup was easy and I was pleased with everything else about the trail camera making it worth the price. Good luck with yours.  3 1/2 stars is what I would have ultimately given this trail cam.Update 8-1-13: After several more trips and checking the cam I have found that battery life has increased enough to warrant the return of the half star it lost. The unit charges the internal battery off the first set of D cell batteries you install. Once this is accomplished the battery drain has seemed to slow.  Additionally, a friend of mine purchased the same cam and has set it to video and loves it. Understand, the area he hunts is just a few hundred yards from his back door though so battery life isn't an issue for him. He transfers the video to his Iphone using \"pineapple\" conversion program(I have an Android) and has brought them to work to share.

The set up was just as simple as people said it would be.  The instructions are detailed and clear. The only hitch occurred because the red and green \"pilot\" lights that tell what the camera is doing, are very hard to see.I strapped the camera to a tree where it had a view across my back yard for about 80 feet.  I wanted to see what was stealing suet feeders and wrecking the bird feeder, and I wanted to see what was eating lily flowers before they opened.  I went out the back door (about 15-20 feet from the cam) at midnight to see if I could see the camera work at night.  I saw the \"invisible\" flash go on and I finally saw the red light.  In the morning I went out the deck door (about 80 feet from the cam in the line of the lens), and I went to the Truth cam and removed the card to see what I had photographed during the night.  The card had about 15 images.  Half were of my leaving via the back door at midnight.  The pictures were clear and I was fully recognizable.  The other half caught me the moment I opened the sliding door on the deck, even though I was 80 feet away.  It continued firing shots until I was face to face with the lens and turned it off.  At 80 feet I was not recognizable. At 60 I was clear and easy to identify.After a night of operating, the LCD indicated that the 4 \"D\" cells were still 99% full.The only thing at all disappointing in the camera so far is the two indicator lights which are just too dim and recessed to be clearly seen from a distance in daylight.

In the case of a running deer, it still got a good photo before the deer left the frame.The only dissapointment I have with the unit is in the night-time shots. Any photo within 25 feet is fairly well lit, but any shot at a distance father than 25 feet is not lit well by the flash. The IR detector still detects animals and movement at at longer distance, but they are not very visible in the shots. This may be caused by my set-up. I have it mounted high enough in a tree so that it can't be reached from the ground by trespassers.All in all, a good camera, great day-time photos. It would be nicer if the memory card could be removed without opening the case, but I suppose that's to keep it weather proof.UPDATE 12/14/2012 - 1800 photos taken so far, original batteries still at 60% operating in a temperature range of 0-65 F.

I liked that one, so I bought two more of the same configuration.

Amazon did accept a return but for a restocking fee. When I told them I found this disappointing, they refunded that charge. Kudos Amazon! They continue to impress me.  My opinion? Products like this should fail very, very rarely. What's inside is not that complex. Ask anyone who's worked on military electronics in the field. We need to hold vendors to higher standards to compete on the world stage. Battery usage is good, although buy Tenergy rechargeable D Cells and a good charger, it will save you quickly because wow, D cells are expensive.  Two of the Transcend SD memory cards I bought failed in these cameras in just a few months. So far, Kingston and Sandisk SD cards have been working fine for me.  This camera has given some really nice shots, although, of course, I have never seen a picture as nice as what they advertise in their package. It's not very different from a cheeseburger commercial in that regard.This seems to be a situation where a couple guys come up with good idea, find some local talent to get the ball rolling, then take their idea to China get it made for pennies, then reap the rewards.

An LCD screen would be nice, but not worth the $$ to me. And another thing to break, freeze, etc.I have the camera set on the highest sensitivity setting.As a test, I set this up in my back yard, hoping to get pics of my dog running around in our fence. I got some of him, but it also picked up my neighbor walking along the other side of the fence, and separately picked up his medium sized dog, both of which were 50 feet from the camera. I was pleasantly surprised!When I set the cam up in the woods, I put out corn piles a few feet away and about 15-20 feet away. When I first started going through the pics, I was disappointed because the pics looked empty, which is why some people say not to use the highest setting. When I looked closer, there was something moving in every pic. The camera picked up a red squirrel coming down the tree and at the far corn pile, 15+ feet away! It even picked up that little bugger in complete darkness with the flash (the glowing squirrel eyes were pretty funny). I also got pics of a blue jay at my corn and some crows.After a couple days, the deer found the corn and I got a ton of deer pics after that, along with more squirrel and bird pics. The pics are very clear. I don't know why you would need 7 mp pics. I was hoping for about 50 pics after the first four days. My first set was 510 pics(!), with about 2/3 being squirrel/birds and the last 1/3 being mostly deer.In my setup along a trail in the woods with a semi-clearing, I do not have an angle to test how far away you would get good pics in a field with the flash, so I cannot speak to that. I also have not tried the video, but I will update this if I do. But for an entry level cam (it was $77 when I got it), I am very impressed with this cam.It is not completely silent, but very close and it has not spooked the deer. You will not hear it unless you are within a couple feet and the deer sometimes look at it, but don't leave (when they are really close). It also glows very slightly if you are close to it and look at it, so it may not work as a security cam (unless well hidden or out of reach).It takes 4 D batteries. After two weeks in the woods, with temps in the 30s at night and 1300+ pics taken, the battery indicator still says 99% (which is the max).Get a big SDHC card. The ad says it will only take 8 GB. I am using 16 GB and it works great. If you are putting this out somewhere remote, get two cards, so you can swap them out and view the pics at home (unless you can pull them into your computer or phone). I got the 16 GB, which will hold thousands of pics. Not that you need all that, but better to get too many pics than blanks. I suggest using the 3 shot burst. When something moving goes by, I find the first shot or last may be empty, but one of the three gets the culprit (if not all three).UPDATE:Last year was brutal in MN. Most of deer season was 5-10 degrees for a high, with lows below zero. This camera worked great for a second year. I do not get blank shots. If I look close, there is always some movement (animal or bird eating my corn). I do not get phantom shots of trees or bushes moving.I moved it to a new, more open spot. I get day and night pics 40-50 feet away. After deer season, I dumped the last of my corn all over the cut out area, to see which deer made it through the season. After about five days, I had 2,340 pics. All the deer I was getting pics of pre-season were still there. They patterned us! That week, it snowed and was an average of about 5 degrees for a high, and the camera kept right on taking all week, both night and day.

Primarily for security purposes and also because I am a wildlife nut.  I've been curious of what animals are roaming around my back yard when I'm not there.  I got the camera when I was on vacation and I set it up, sadly my generator did keep the wildlife away, but it did take a picture everytime I walked into the back yard.  I have the camera set on a tree in a rear corner of my grassy area in the backyard and it's approximately 55 feet from the corner of my driveway and it detected my movement and took a picture (daytime).  It did take a few night time shots and did catch a deer from about 20 feet away and it was crystal clear.  All of the pictures it took so far are fantastic.  Clear, no blur and sharp.The one error I did make was with regard to the sensitivity.  The instructions state that during the warmer months you'll need to set the sensitivity to \"High\" so the camera can differentiate between body heat and other objects.  My home is in rural farmland and forest and I've been trying to determine if I have a bear or coyote (or both) roaming through my backyard.  I left some chicken bones out one night and they were gone the next morning.  Sadly the sensitivity was on \"Normal\".  Had it been on \"High\" I would have captured the critter that took them!  Other than that, the camera has been great and I plan to buy a second or third one.The camera does not come with an SD card so you'll have to get those.  I did and I also got the cable lock (highly recommended).Well I've been away from the house for two weeks and I'll find out this coming weekend what's been going on there.

It has its imperfections.", "Author": "UniversityDoc", "ReviewID": "R28J5IXM43M8HG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I live on acres of forested land with lots of wildlife and wanted to capture them in their habitat. I also needed a new camera to replace an old film type Stealth Game cam. I did a great deal of research in order to purchase a new game cam that would do a satisfactory job without costing a lot of money. There are many game cams out there, some low priced to higher end ones, not necessarily getting what you pay for anymore. I settled on this one because of the more positive views, and weighing them with the negative reviews from various websites. The price was right beating out Bass Pro shops by $16.00 plus the free shipping made it a terrific deal for me.I like this camera. It is very easy to set up and operate. It's nearly ready when you pull it out of the frustration prone packaging. All you need to do is add the SD card and batteries, adjust the settings to your choice and set it up outside. I used a 16GB card and had it sitting up for two weeks. It took 124 photos and the batteries were still charged. I replaced the card and moved it to a new spot. Be forewarned: This camera is very sensitive: most of my photos taken were of leaves from a nearby flower. I did get two nightime photos of deer, but due to the limitations of the camera at night, I believe other reviewers mentioned this, also, it is difficult to see them clearly. Though, their eyes glow from the IR and I see the deer's outlines, they're not what I expected. I want to see the deer. The day photos are sharp, clear and vibrant. The camera shows, date, time and moon phase. All in all, I like the camera, but I don't love it because the nighttime photos leave a great deal to be desired. I'll probably buy another brand of camera due to this so I can see what animals do show up.UPDATE TO MY REVIEW, UPDATE ON 12/31/11: I went out and bought two more game cameras, but this Primos wasn't it. As I already said, I don't like the b&w; nighttime infrared shots, so I went looking for a good game camera that took nighttime color photos, yet wasn't too expensive. I also don't like the cheap rubber strip at the bottom of the camera designed to keep the card dry. Mine broke after a month. I'm not a hunter; I like to view the wildlife on my property. I paid $85.00 for the Primos cam here, and for the inadequacies with that, I didn't want to spend as much for another one. I found the one I was looking for: the Moultrie D50 5mp Camera while searching the Amazon site. The reviews and capabilities and reasonable price made the decision for me, as did my personal experience with this Primos.Unlike this Primos cam, which has a cheap, rubber, breakable strip that protects the media card at the bottom of the camera, the Moultrie has the slot in the camera inside the case. You press in the card and it snaps back out. You don't have to struggle to get to the card. With the Primo cam, you need tweezers or fingernails to get the card out. The manufacturer says the D batteries should last 60 days. I had it up for three weeks for the 2nd time, and the batteries were at 0%Whether you're a hunter or a wildlife enthusiast, if you're in the market for a camera to view wildife with great day and night color photos and don't want to spend a lot of money, this isn't the camera for you. Check out the Moultrie D50 5 MP Digital Game Camera. If you're into night time infrared shots, and don't mind the rubber strip that keeps the media card dry  breaking on you, then you'll like this camera.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Multiple Issues", "Author": "4BigFish", "ReviewID": "R31TVL7Q9YRSG3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have 2 Truth Cam 35's.

We have had a couple incidents of vandals and I wanted to get some photos.First thing I learned is that the PIR sensor will not work through a window. Thats OK, it wasnt advertised that it could...So I set up the cameras on my basketball hoop facing my driveway. I added the 4 batteries, a 8GB SD car, turned the unit on to photo and put it on the low setting.24 later I checked the evidence. The card had recorded about 1900 images! A bit unexpected...I started going through the photos ad it seems like the unit took photos every 30 second or so (5 at a time). It was great for watching the day go by but not what i wanted.I'm surprised that at the low setting the sensor just kept going. I actually purchased 2 units and both do this. I don't know if my neighborhood environment messes it up because its not in the woods.One camera was placed near the roof of my house pointing down on the cars the other was on a pole pointing level with the ground. So IR interference was different for both cameras. Its not like both were picking up heat from far away.Anyway its not too big a deal because i can just hold down the next button on my image viewer and go through the batch in about 6-8 minutes.

The infrared light is great when you use them correctly at the right distance between 5-20 feet, too close blown out too far not light enough. The transition between night and day can sometimes be a little dark as the infrared doesn't go off sometimes. It does make some noise when it takes a picture but it did not seem to bother the deer too much.

It works for us because we use it for a campground camera, and even at that it might make an attractive item to steal. The bigger the tree you strap it too the less obvious it is and it's hard to strap to anything else. For instance you can't strap it to the legs on a fifth wheel. We tried, it just slides down to the ground. It doesn't have a threaded hole for a tripod, but it does have recessed threads on the back for some kind of optional mount, sold separately, of course.

I've been hunting for decades and have experience with dozens of trail cams, mostly bad.  Most of the low to mid range units seems to malfunction after a season or two (if you're lucky) or be completely drained of batteries long before it's time to go back and check them.The Primos Truth Cam 35 is a tank!  It's big, ugly, bulky and weighs a ton (compared to the little tiny ones out there) and that's good and bad... The good is that trespassers will think twice about stealing it (size and weight, had someone snag the incriminating memory card once, but they left the camera), It takes 3 full seasons for the batteries to die (you can leave this thing up all year) and the 3 mega pixel pictures take up very little space on the memory card (you can store thousands of pictures.)  The bad, is that's it's big, bulky, heavy and uses lots of D batteries.Picture quality is good enough for the purpose, day photos are good, night photos really depend on the outside temperature, the colder it is, the better the pic but the game is recognizable in the heat of the Florida summer nights and the blur is acceptable for moving game.The camera range is good during day light (about 30 yards) and acceptable at night (10 to 15 yards at night.)The motion sensitivity setting is something I now can't live without, If the camera is set up at a funnel such as an opening in a fence it can be placed nice and close (10 yards) with a low sensitivity setting, if you're facing an open field, set the sensitivity to high.  Remember to face the camera North or South so it won't be blinded by the sunrise or sunset.I now own 6 of these and have no reason on the face of this earth to even think about buying a different make/model.  8 Gig memory cards are cheap, and if you buy the micro ones that fit in a full sized adapter, you can pop that card in your phone and transmit the pictures to your favorite picture sharing location in the \"cloud\" for all to see back at the camp instantly (3 MB pics won't abuse your wireless data plan as much as the newer formats.)I gave this thing 5 stars based on value and reliability.

I assume this is because the LEDs aren't bright enough.Deer can definitely see this thing when it takes pictures at night. On the second picture the deer was always looking right at the camera.Overall, I would recommend purchasing the Primos Truth Camera 35 and I will be purchasing another for next season.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Primos Truth Cam 25 game camera", "Author": "ravot", "ReviewID": "R16NB0F7TI52Y2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera for the price. Easy to use. Once you insert four batteries, you can have the camera up and running in 20 seconds. Takes photos or videos.It's quiet when it takes pictures. However, it has a red and green light that turn on when it detects motion and while it takes a picture. I place electric tape over both these small lights. The deer and foxes don't seem to mind the lights though when I leave them uncovered.The best part of the camera is the fast wake up feature. You won't have many missed animals and blank pictures.

Not saying it doesn't make any noise, but makes no difference in the woods. Out of 830 pics only 2 were snow white. Not sure what causes this. Battery life may be the only down fall. Of the 830 pics, 700+ were from one camera over an 11 day period and battery life is down to 70%. Not horrible, but deffinately not that good. If battery life was better I would've rated 5 stars.", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "found out whats eating up my food plots", "Author": "raymon", "ReviewID": "R2ZBYBBDS7N599", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "took over 1700 pictures  without changing Batteries easy to set up had some problems pulling up pictures on my lap top something to do with format I don't really know what that is but my daughter in law got it working I have two of them now cant wait for the next hunting season", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "absolutely will not pick up motion! buy another of better quality.", "Author": "tracey simpson", "ReviewID": "R31UCE67A9W25J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this unit has never worked for me reliably.it never picks up motion is the main flaw.I have walked in front of it trying to get pics and nothing! what pics it does get is very poor quality.i would not buy anything primos again.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Misc.", "Author": "B.
