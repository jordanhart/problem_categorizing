Save yourself the headache and take my word for it, You MUST use IE in order to access \"full features\", which is most of the features. I assumed there would be an iPhone app to access the live feed, there is not. You are limited to typing in the IP address via Safari.The video quality isn't fantastic, but it's not that bad IF they lighting is decent. Another annoyance is that there is no battery option, the only way to power the camera is via DC/power outlet - and the cord is not very long.The hardware feels cheap, hard plastic. The back of the unit has two slots, one labeled \"SD\" -- DO NOT attempt to put an SD Card into either slot - they do not go anywhere... I made this mistake and had to disassemble the unit in order to retrieve my memory card...So far, I have not found a way to actually record video. I have configured it to send images via e-mail when motion is detected, which is nice - but an actual video would be much better... (I'll update this if I figure out how to do it...)Overall, for the price ($99 at the time of writing, prime eligible) it's not what I had in mind, but IF I can get it to record actual video - I would probably buy another unit... For now, 3 stars because it is more peace of mind, but disappointing.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "A good choice of IP camera .", "Author": "Duong Thanh Liem", "ReviewID": "RHNCNGGJ0LARN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good image, simple interface, clear instruction, smooth operation.

So, if constant camera visualization of your goods is important to you, this little device is excellent. It is based on Internet Protocol so once installed (and unlike many other who have commented here, installation is actually very simple if you have the right direction for the end product you seek) this device provides top of the line real-time audio and visual streaming, multimedia recording, image capture (be just like those agents on TV\u2019s Person of Interest, Homeland, etc), have it connected to your alarm system, and secure over-the-air connectivity for complete access to remote control, video window and intercom system.This well designed device makes you feel safe and it is reliable \u2013 just check your area of surveillance form anywhere you happen to be and rule out snoopers or thieves or discover who is using your computer equipment etc in your absence.
