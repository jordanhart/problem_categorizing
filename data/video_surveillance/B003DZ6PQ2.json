{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Well built, easy install, good night vision", "Author": "LBJ", "ReviewID": "R1RC4BI0R7BMOO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little camera is very well built with an alumimum body and sliding sun shield. Please note that the camera bracket that I received is not the one pictured on Amazon. The good news is that it is smaller, the same color as the camera and may be metal, just not sure. I really think they have upgraded this part of the camera. Nice! This camera is about half the length of two other cameras that I just recently purchased. SVAT CV31 Hi-Res Outdoor CCD Security Camera w/Long Range Night Vision Please read my Amazon review on this camera! Both of these cameras are about the same in picture and construction quality. The Svat camera comes with 60' of power/video cable with RCA connectons only. Your may need these 20 Pcs of BNC Male Connectors Adapters for RG59 Coaxial Cable 1FV  to complete hookup to your DVR card in your computer. If plugging into a TV you will not need these connectors. The VideoSecur camera has the BNC connector so just order your video/power cable with BNC connectors VideoSecu 3 X 50 Feet Power Video Cable with BNC RCA Connector for CCTV Security Cameras 1QA The VideoSecur camera does come with the power adaptor, you just will need the power/video cable. The BNC connectors twist lock at the connection, RCA cables do not. I like the BNC connectors better as they will not come apart. The day time picture is great. The night vision is about the same on both cameras up to 45 feet or so with no additional lighting. I just installed 2 motion detection floodlights which are also a great 5 star product from Amazon (Heath Zenith SL-5525-WH 250-Watt Quartz Motion-Sensing Light) and these make the night picture almost a good as daytime. The Svat and the VideoSecur camera will both do motion recording when hooked up to a DVR card that supports this feature. Since I have motion detection on my cameras and floodlights I can clearly indentify which one of my neighbors cats is digging in my flower bed and leaving paw prints on the roof of my car at 3 AM in the morning. How about that! I put some signs up that I purchased in the windows warning folks that they are on camera and being recorded. I do feel much safer in my home and I think that a potential unwanted guest will probably move to another home to commit a crime. (Sorry about that neighbors). I certainly would not hesitate to recommend this 5 star camera. The only thing I can't say is how long they will last, only time will tell. I can say that all 4 cameras I have ordered where packaged well for shipping and all worked right out of the box.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Mac Coder", "ReviewID": "R1B8Z9ZCQSJ455", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE: I have 4 of these, and they have worked fine for almost two years now.-----------Note that all security cameras with built-in IR illuminators suffer from a common issue: the illuminator picks up on dust motes and tiny insects floating in the air right in front of the lens and turns them into giant bright white blobs, triggering video-based motion detection (if you are using such). This generates numerous false alarms.Fortunately, the solution is simple -- turn off the IR on the camera and use an external IR source. This camera doesn't have a switch for that purpose, but you can simply unscrew the cylindrical case near the front, revealing the IR module surrounding the lens, Unplug the IR module, and that problem (at least) is solved. For extra McGyver points, you can remove the IR module from the camera, connect it to 12Vdc, and mount it away from the camera but pointed at the camera's view -- Voila! Night vision without the giant blobs. I assume that removing the module would void the warranty, but what does McGyver care about warranties?For the McGyver-impaired, there are nice 850nm IR illuminators available from Amazon for under $10 (\"YY Trade IR30\" OR \"YY_IR30\", ASIN B001P2E4U4). This is a good match to the built-in illuminator in the camera.For an inexpensive color camera, this unit has exceptional low light capability, and excellent IR sensitivity at 850nm, the wavelength of most IR illuminators. The IR functionality is pixel-by-pixel, meaning that you can have a scene that is partly illuminated by natural light and partly by IR, and the natural light portion will be in color, and the IR part in glorious monochrome.The 3.6mm lens provides an excellent wide field of view.The supplied mount is flexible and sturdy, although not a true ball-socket mount.The supplied 12Vdc supply is the smallest I have seen.The supplied security sticker... is a security sticker.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "videosecu IRX5", "Author": "Patrick W.

The camera is up about 10 Feet high. As you can see the coverage is great. The colors are correct on this camera. If you are using a low budget bullet-cam (like the ones in the bundled kits)... do yourself a favor and upgrade. This also has superior night vision compared to the zMODO bullet cam I replaced. The only think I can think that I do not really care for is the mount. Also, If I were to buy another camera, I would suggest finding one with 500-600 TVL (Depending on your DVR's resolution options).

Young \"no nonsense critic\"", "ReviewID": "RRZQ2LSGWFJDE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not in the habit of doing reviews, but this cam is about as good as one can expect for the price. I have dozens of similarly priced cams purchased over the past 10 years so I have  a lotexperience in this area. Most home CCTV cams do a reasonable job in day light, but too often fail badly at night.  What makes this superior is the excellent gamma, based on visual observation, not measurement.  At night, black areas are displayed a satisfying deep black, while whites are captured with the proper intensity.  Note that poorly made cams (most of the el cheapos) tend to blur a range of shades between black and white.  Running a quick A-B test on my older cams, it was immediate that this cam had superior fine details in its night mode.  As someone mentioned, this cam is rated at only 420 lines, but it out performed cams with higher line rating. It was the main reason why I decided to take a chance with this cam.  Over the years, I learn that it isn't the number of lines, but how linear is the gamma response.  You can have 520 lines, and poor gamma and end up with a blurring of details.  Swann DVR have some of the worst cams made, where at night, dark areas comes out flat gray, and bright white areas comes out a dull gray.  I am in the process of  replacing most of them.The wide angle lens is not just a plus, but is a must for good coverage when placed in a corner of a room.  With a standard lens, you lose about 30% of the view presented by this cam.  In some cases, I would need two cams to provide enough coverage.  Not anymore.  Also, the mount is a decent sturdy mount, compared to the flimsy mount found in cheap cams.One reason I am contributing this review is that it is nearly impossible to buy cams based on the specs provided.  As explained above, number of lines doesn't cut it. For lack of full professional specs, we are all buying a pig in a poke.  Thanks to Amazon user reviews, we now have a better chance of beating the odds.", "Date": "July 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Added to my ZMODO 500GB Security System - WOW this camera is WAY better!", "Author": "JUCD VPR", "ReviewID": "R26JQFRO2MMOBD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera rocks!!

They didn't fail gradually. 75% of them failed at once, negating a good amount of the night vision. I see others have had similar failures. I haven't had water issues like some have reported, though.During the day, the camera still gives decent images - and I really like the wider angle lens for more coverage compared to some cameras with narrower fields of view.Luckily, I had an older camera of a different brand with a similar LED array. The older camera had been damaged and wasn't working, but the board with the LEDs was functional. As a result, I was able to swap it it with the defective LED board from this camera.So, it's back working again and is functioning well, but I have to knock off a couple of stars for the quality. I have a feeling the manufacturer is using lower powered LEDs than they ought to and running them higher than they should be to get more low light performance - a common practice.If the replacement LED board fails, I'll probably look into another brand to replace the camera.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Clear Bright night security", "Author": "Mike Parris", "ReviewID": "R34A0555VCHASN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Better picture and Clarity than my last $150 dollar IR camera.

Putting one above my garage door meant I could only see about 30% of the two car driveway.I decided to give this VideoSecu camera a shot and was a little hesitant due to the low price.  Can't be any more happy with the unit.  Not only is it a much wider viewing angle which can pick up all 100% of my two car driveway and a bit of the grass on either side, it also had a better picture quality and color balance.Will definitely consider picking some more of these units up for areas that need a wider field of view or a better quality picture.The only downsides I could say is that the unit can really only be mounted on a wall based on the included camera mounts adjustability.  The unit it replaced was mounted under a overhang and could adjust to any degree so I had to move where I mounted it.

The Zmodo power supply couldn't power this camera, so I did have to use the included power supply by hooking it into the Zmodo wire bundle I already ran, which worked perfectly. I'm going to purchase a few more of these to replace the junk cameras that came in my kit.The only reason I deduct one star is because the dinky mounting screw supplied with this wouldn't let me attach the mount to the top of the camera. There is a threaded hole there, but the screw isn't long enough to thread in. Other than that small complaint, this camera is good value for the money.Update: After almost 4 months about half of the IR LEDs have burned out on this camera. Deducting another star for this. Still not a bad camera for the price, as there aren't many alternatives in this price range. No fogging or leaking problems, but my camera is mounted under the eve so there is no direct exposure to precipitation. We'll see how it handles cold winter temps. I'll update my review in a few months.Update: I have three of these cameras mounted now, all for just over 1 year. The IR LEDs have almost completely failed on all three. The LEDs seem to be arranged in 4 banks/quadrants. None of the cameras have more than one functional bank of LEDs. Surprisingly, they still have good clarity at night even with minimal IR illumination. The cameras themselves are functioning well in all other aspects.", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Indoor Outdoor Security Camera", "Author": "Randy Zarn \"Randy\"", "ReviewID": "R1EPQGENPTJ6F8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am realy pleased with these new cameras, they have a much clearer picture day and night than the stock cameras that came with my system.I would suggest these to anybody that would like to upgrade there cameras.", "Date": "July 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "great night vision", "Author": "LI", "ReviewID": "R3JZ8W1BG9M3H5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "it is a great night vision camera. minor issue - sometime color changes to black .

I wish it had the secure wire (BNC Connector) which feeds through the mounting bracket directly in to the drilled hole so as not to allow an obvious spot to cut it, but hey, it's an \"economical\" camera.  Easy to mount and yes it does come with the power supply just in case your other cameras have used up all available power ports as in my case.  It seems durable and the daytime picture quality is very sharp.Daytime:  Provides sharp clear wide angle view for a solid 50+ feet.  Daytime view better than my original NightOwl cameras.Cons:Night:  Picture quality drops off significantly.  Only about 15 feet or so with IR on.  In spite of its advertised distance and quality.  Pixelates as well which makes the view it does provide less desirable.  In my case, at night I only want to cover about 20 or so feet of my driveway so it is acceptable, but only barely.  The NightOwl cameras really shine here ( I think they are made by Sony) ; the VideoSecure cameras are not as good...Overall a good buy for the money but be aware of night views.  Maybe there is something wrong with my cameras, but all IR's are on so I can't say for sure.  If I can figure out a solution for the night view I will update the camera review to 5 out of 5.  Its all about day/night quality and durability.  Right now I can't give it more than 3 because I expected more in the night vision quality.", "Date": "May 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Better than night owl", "Author": "D Primeaux", "ReviewID": "RD7XK78VLQRIF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have purchas a knight owl system and bought this spare camera and its better than the Knight owls system", "Date": "May 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "very good quality camera", "Author": "clampertim", "ReviewID": "R1RI34MWC1UHBR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This unit was bought to replace another that had quit working.

The specifications are indeed as indicated, with acceptable resolution, clear focus, and crisp images with realistic colors. The focal length is appropriate for installation at gates and doors -- wide enough to capture a landing. The night vision does an excellent job, with daytime-like images in two porticos I have, and better-than-expected views of open space, although there is some minor spotlight-effect out in the open.The LEDs are visible in the dark, so this won't be ideal in a stealth environment. But by the same token, they do subtly indicate their presence, which could have value as a deterrence.The housing is also larger than the product images suggest -- think Australian beer can. Again, not stealthy, but possibly valuable as a deterrence. Bullet cam this is not.Overall excellent value.
