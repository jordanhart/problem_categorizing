You have to be careful as many companies will tell you their cable is RG-59 when it is a thinner version called micro RG -59. Should you have to replace the BNC connector this is easily accomplished with the Swann cable. Having installed cable for years I highly recommend this product. One additional note this cable is rated for ceiling and walls.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$59.99", "Features": "Superior Quality Integrated With Dc Power & Coaxial Rg-59 Cable\nBnc Connectors For Cctv Video Cameras\nEasy To Install Siamese Joints Tear Away As Needed\nImproved Quality Video Signal\nFire Rated Ft4/Cmr & Ul Approved For In-Wall Installation", "Name": "Swann Fire-Rated Bnc Extension Cable (200 Feet) SWPRO-60MFRC-GL", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41wVHvYxTwL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0076CLICY"}}
