Worked great with no problems for the past year. POE makes this much easier to route power & data to. The images are crisp and clear. Night vision is very good as well. The WebUI is easy to use and you can set it up to email you a photo when it detects motion which has been useful.A few nights ago I caught someone on my front porch at 1:30 AM peering in the window and scoping out around the fence and back yard. They left but I called the police who caught them breaking into a house an hour or so later. Worthwhile purchase for any homeowner.", "Date": "October 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome IP POE network cam.
