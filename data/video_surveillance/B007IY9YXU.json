The customer representative asked specific information about the item and he would email me the shipping information, one complete day passed and I didn't receive it so I called again and they didn't have the replacement order on file, I had to give all the information again plus some more and they finally proceeded on it.Quite often I have to re-start the DVR, the images desapear, only the squares and number of each channel are shown.I chose Swann because their support team was highly reviewed, though not in my case, I am very disappointed so far.I do not recommend this brand.I am RETURNING this equipment, the \"infra-red\" on another camera is not working now and the DVR keeps showing the squares with the channel # but NO IMAGE every 3 to 4 days. I called SWANN and they are just asking me to do a lot of tests again besides putting me on hold sometimes for more than 10 minutes.I installed this system not even two months ago and have had a lot of problems, how about after warranty expires????Pure JUNK.I will try another brand.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "swann camera security", "Author": "Roger K.
