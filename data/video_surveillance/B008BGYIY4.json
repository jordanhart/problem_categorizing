Got two items, both defective.  Competition has 650-700 resolution, this is only 420.  HUGE compared to competition (8-10 inches versus 4).  Manual written by non-English speaker with no idea how to write instruction manual.  C'MON PEOPLE.  You apparently have a hard-working customer support staff who took the time to call me. Surely SOMEONE could improve this manual!  SOMEONE has an idea how to set this up and can decipher these tables and how the various 4-6-8-12 bit settings correspond to the single 8-position DIP on this unit.  How long could that take?", "Date": "April 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "effective but cheap", "Author": "SHAWN O'SHEA", "ReviewID": "R2UHGXK94DFV29", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I would recommend this if you are on a low budget. I only had my Camera for 6 months and the camera went out, total black screen. Zmodo tried to fix it via over the phone. When nothing worked I had to send it back for repair/replacement. I havent gotten my camera back yet. I give it two stars since it broke in such a short time frame, but yet had a good quality picture when it did work.", "Date": "February 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera for the price", "Author": "Ad_vice", "ReviewID": "R36P22VYOQNHXF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own this camera along with 7 fixed Nightowl 600 TVL cameras.  I bought this camera for its night vision capability (which most PTZ don't have), and for its focal length distance (22x Zoom). Even thou the resolution is somewhat lower than my 600 TVL cameras, you cannot tell the difference unless you expand the video from the grid screen view, and even then its still good, you won't miss a thing.The only drawback I found is the size of the camera.  It is huge, I try to get the size before I bought it, but it was not listed anywhere. It is about 8\" to 10\".  So big that I could not mount it at the front of the house. It look somewhat illegal...more like a neighborhood watch camera that belongs on a light pole.Setting up the camera was easy.  Test it before you install it. That way if you mount it and it don't work, you will know that wire size or similar is causing the problem. If you have a DVR with PTZ output, you do not need a separate controller to operate the camera. You do not need to mess with the camera dip switches either. PTZ output usually marked +TX and -TX or simply + and - and have a green color connector. The blue wire of the camera is + and the brown wire is - so connect likewise. Once the camera is powered and the video cable is connected, use the mouse from your DVR to control it. Select PTZ and you will see the control interface.If your camera work when you test it at the DVR and don't work when installed, 1. make sure you are using the supplied 5A power supply that came with the camera. 2. make sure the wire that goes to the camera is large enough to carry the current required by the camera.  If the wire is too small, the video will show, but no rotation or zoom. (NOTE: regular video wire sold for video camera can only be used for the video).  Use a different wire for the power and RS485 control. Use 18 gauge wire for up to about 140 feet.Overall, this is a good PTZ camera for the price.  It has one of the best night vision clarity you ever seen. (There is no glare in mine as someone mention)  It will make your 600-700 TVL cameras look like a joke at night.I still need to test how the camera performs in cold weather and the reliably of it.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a bad PTZ Cam", "Author": "Jim B", "ReviewID": "R1XM5GNVI2DH7V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This isn't the greatest PTZ cam, but for the price I am not complaining all that much. Its 420TVL, the color is not that great, but it could be worse. The night vision is pretty dam good. I have it mounted on the side corner of my house so I get the most use of it possible. I am only in a 1 story home, so my lift, tilt up, is limited. When at max zoom I can look at my neighbors grass nicely. I am sure this cam was meant to be mounted on a second story or higher.While I am happy with this cam, I will be looking for a better one in the future. But for not this one serves my needs nicely.", "Date": "March 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lousy....video stopped working after 6 weeks", "Author": "CARLTON KNOX", "ReviewID": "R1XWUJUROLGJ05", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Lousy....video stopped working after 6 weeks.

Installation was easy, but I had to go to the Zmodo website to find the polarity of the RS485 connection. The installation manual is a poor translation from Chinese to English.My main complaints are with the night vision, and the weatherproofing.At night, the IR lights are so intense that they create a reflection in the lens that makes it appear that there is a halo around the screen. Also, the lights have a tendency to bleach out anything that is within 100' of the camera. The combination of these items make this camera pretty much useless at night.Regarding the weatherproofing. If this camera has a fan or a heater, they are not working. Overnight, condensation forms on the inside of the lens and makes the image unusable. The condensation clears quickly after daybreak when the unit warms up. During the day, and in warmer weather, the camera performs as promised.I'm giving it two stars because it doesn't perform as promised at night.Zmodo 420TVL 4-88mm High Speed PTZ 22X Zoom Outdoor Weatherproof Security Camera CM-Z2213GYUpdate 03/09/13  Fogging issue has mostly cleared up, still a halo around the image, but you can still see images at night. The IR distance is quite impressive. I can see images at least 200 feet away.
