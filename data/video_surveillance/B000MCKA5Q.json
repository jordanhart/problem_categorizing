Unfortunately there were no instructions, and wires on the harness from the camera were unlabeled but luckily they were easy to figure out.The video out line is easy to spot as its the industry standard yellow RCA cable (17' extension included)The positive voltage that powers the camera is the wire that has the fuse in it (this line connects to the white back-up light in your tail lights and powers the camera)The remaining line is the ground and can be attached to almost any bare metal on vehicle, I usually choose a screw somewhere close.The cables included are long, but you may need to an extension for the power wire (to tell the receiver when to turn on the rear view monitor). I chose to extend the wire from the tail light so the video camera and the receiver got the same signal.The top of the camera is not noted, so you'll have to adjust it after installation.The camera automatically adjusts between regular and IR mode and  the LED's around the lens will not light up. You'll know when it's in IR mode as the picture will change from color to B&W.;The field of view is a little constricted compared to many cameras, but its enough for me (I can't see the corners of the vehicle, but can see behind me).", "Date": "December 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera, missing hole saw", "Author": "Lorenzo Camejo", "ReviewID": "RW7406R5UQCCT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'd installed the camera in my Jeep Grand Cherokee with Pioneer 5600 DVD. The Installation was not simple, since I had to add extra video cable (the power cable is longer). As I noticed in other review, the hole saw that was supposed to come included in the kit was missing so I had to buy another one to be able to make the proper hole. The camera is water and dust resistant, and has a clear night vision, but since it has no angular lens (peep hole type) it doesn't cover both ends of the bumper and right there you miss the whole point of having a rear view camera. Just because of that, I would suggest further research of other similar products.", "Date": "May 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Image quality good, angle not as wide as I'd like", "Author": "Jeff Mick", "ReviewID": "R23882IYG751ZW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall this seems like a very good camera.  The quality seems good and so far has not had any issues due to weather like previous cameras.  I didn't want to drill a hole in the body of my truck to accommodate this camera so I installed it into a plastic housing under the bumper.  It gets a good view, but surprisingly it can't actually see to the corners of the vehicle.  The viewing angle of the camera almost makes it, but objects have to be 3-4 feet away (behind) the corners in order for the camera to pick them up.  In the worst case, if something were right at the bumper on either side but just out of view of the side mirrors, you wouldn't be able to see it and could hit it.  Other than this, if you're starting out somewhere that you know to be clear, then you're OK and can use your mirrors and camera to make it all work.  The image quality is quite good, and at night can see well too.", "Date": "March 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "A big investment on a low budget rear view camera", "Author": "Alex V. \"Alex\"", "ReviewID": "R2LM4LLJCYZ4XX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this rear view camera to be used on my Pioneer Car AVHP4000DVD Double Din AV Multimedia Receiver that I have on my Lancer 2008.The camera images look GREAT, it also has infrared sensors for an AMAZING night vision, you don't even need your reverse lights to be turned on to see in complete darkeness, I can ASSURE you that.It is waterproof, and this feature I did test it already, since it rains a lot in my country and haven't had a single problem with the camera.UPDATE: 2 years later, this low budget camera is still working great.  The only thing I've noticed is that when the camera gets too much sun light, the image may get a little red/pink and I guess is because of the IR sensors. Once it cools down, the image is displayed correctly.  Anyway, couldn't ask a $20-$40 camera to be ultra high quality so I'm still glad with the purchase.  If anyone else had problems with \"water\", you surely got a deffective product, I take my car to the carwash every week (they wash it with high pressure water) and it rains a lot in here, not a single problem with water so far.", "Date": "August 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "OK Camera with unexpected features", "Author": "DYI Man \"DIY Man\"", "ReviewID": "R2CXX50JQ7MXTR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera intending to put this on the front or rear of my car for an in-cab DVR. Therefore; I was intending to make adjustments to the camera if I needed to so I was planning on opening the case if I had to.What I found when I received the camera was a pit-specked lens. I tried to wipe what I thought was dust off of the lens but I found the pits to be inside - So I took the camera apart and what I found was that the rear of the camera is probably more water-proof than the front lens portion.I uploaded several images one showing the front O-ring is too big for the groove where it is supposed to sit (the picture with the yellow arrow). One side of the ring is supposed to sit in the O-ring groove and the other against the outer lens glass. When I opened the camera I have, the O-ring was pinched and hanging over the groove and potentially susceptible to leaking. Since I had not mounted the camera yet, obviously I fixed the O-ring problem. Also, since I decided to mount this camera on the front, I disconnected the IR LED's.Applying this observation may lead to the conclusion that a portion of these cameras will get water inside them because of incorrect O-ring sizing. If a water-proof camera is important to you you should check yours.Other than that the camera works and seems to have a very good picture - BTW: I polished the front window glass on mine and was able to remove almost all of the pits. Maybe these should be sold as \"camera kits\".", "Date": "January 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "mising items", "Author": "Ricky G.

The flicker makes me wonder if it will last.  It more than suits its purpose of a back-up camera.  It is not meant to shoot movies or anything.  My observations:I tried to test locations using a 13VDC transformer that works on pretty much everything else I have tried including Lowrance Marine Chart Plotters, but it did not power this camera and it only showed a white screen with lines on it.  I almost wrote it off as defective, but tried battery power as a last resort.  Worked fine... IDK why the transformer didnt work with it...Camera seems well built.  I read a thread where a guy said he disassembled one of these and replaced the O-rings...  I have no idea how he did that.  This is like a solid machined piece of aluminum.  I dont see any way to open it up.  It seems like it should not leak though as there are no holes or visible screw heads.My mounting notes:I mounted it where the license plate light does aim pretty much at it, but it doesnt seem to affect it that much.  If you can avoid this, it probably makes the night viewing better.Check behind your bumper before drilling.  My spare is right behind my bumper.  Even if it is not your spare, there is often wiring back there.  Make sure you have adequate depth before you drill.  1.5\" of so of this camera will be behind the bumper.If you want it to be flush mounted and aimed straight back, place both rings behind your bumper after passing the camera through the hole.If you need to angle the camera, place the smaller angled ring on the camera  (flat side toward the camera, angled side toward the bumper) before passing it through the hole in your bumper and place the larger angled ring behind the bumper (angled side toward the bumper, flat side toward the nut).  My mounting sticks out a quarter inch or so as I do have it on an angle to aim it at my trailer hitch.  It would stick out an eighth or less if flush mounted with a straight back view.To get power to the light, most factory tow packages have both positive and negative wires at the trailier wiring plug.  I tapped into these.  They camera now turns on and off with my ignition.Anywhere the RCA connectors plug into each other, tape the connection with electrical tape.  This helps seal out water and also prevents these from coming unplugged over time.The video wire from my NAV unit was pushed through the firewall by putting a small hole in an existing rubber boot.  I put mine directly below the steering wheel through the boot.  I put RTV black around it for good measure to seal out water (although it looked tightly sealed around the wire without it).I ran the video wire down the top of my truck frame with other wires.  When it came close to the muffler, I ran it through/behind the heat shielding along with the factory wiring harness.  I zip tied it in place about every 18\".Avoid pinch points like leaf springs, shocks, or any moving parts.  Only attach the video wire to fixed parts and route it around moving parts.The video cable will likely be too short.  Use an RCA male to male adapter and add another wire if necessary.

The one on the truck is a reverse camera mainly for lining up the trailer hitch. The trailer is a large box trailer and the camera on it is mounted high center to work as a full time rear view mirror when connected.  I chose this product over the similar listing mainly for the lower Lux rating and the free shipping when buying over $25. I connected them to a small 2 channel 3x4\" LCD display I got on Ebay.  Overall I would say I am happy with it. The video quality is plenty good for me to see what is behind me, although I probably wouldn't recommend it for any sort of recording application. The nightvision feature does have limited range of probably 15-20 feet and the camera has a fairly narrow field of view. Probably only 60 degrees total, so if you plan to use this as a backing camera to navigate with when in reverse you need to mount it as high as possible and angled down at a sharp angle to see what is immediately behind you. When I tried using the camera to back up my driveway, it was very difficult mainly because of the lack of depth perception and narrow field of view.

With a small, flush profile it is hidden well within the bumper of my Jeep Wrangler Unlimited.  The price is also a nice feature.  But that is where the positive aspects of this camera end.The picture quality in daylight is adequate at best.  I installed an BOYO camera in my previous Tahoe and it's clarity was far superior to the Pyle.The picture quality at night is NON EXISTENT!  The image is nearly completely black.  Not sure how Pyle can claim \"Night Vision\" with this model.  It is completely useless at night--even with ambient light such as you would find in a parking lot.Save yourself the time and hassle.  Do not fall for the claims and the price.  You get what you pay for and I should have known better.
