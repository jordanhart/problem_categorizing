Great deal", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Randy\"", "ReviewID": "R3CW5MOZE9567S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just recevied my dvr with 4 cameras today of the big snow storm in ohio.  The camers are at the high end of the low res cameras under 500 tvls price was great so I wanted to check dvrs and cameras out , for I have never owned any before.The color was very good 3.6 wide lens was very nice whole front yard and road was seen easy. Was not expecting much,  It got dark amd the 18 leds kicked in with the color off  and it was bright out in my living as I moved around in the house with all the lights off and used a 19 inch tv as a monitor. So I like this one some much im going to pull the 500g Hd out of it and gift it . I will now buy a HDMI  Elec Dvr and 4 or 8 cameras with the higher tvls like 700 so I could read a car plate if one pulled in the driveway.  Did not check out the cloud part yet , Just wanted to review this and let people know what a good deal this is, Also I used a wirless mouse on the dvr with the little dongle in the usb port.Now time to snow blow snow so I can mount the camers yet tonight.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "wow only $120.00", "Author": "stretchdez", "ReviewID": "R3TPIMBMEG9Q3T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "you can not get a better setup for the money. and yes I will be getting one more for inside my home.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very satisfied!", "Author": "CallmeFishmeal", "ReviewID": "R1V2ZF9GHRJ5I2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought these cameras because my house was broke into the other day. Knowing how much of a fool I looked when I didn't have any evidence of them breaking in, there was something that had to be done. Now I feel safe and secure, 24/7! I did not know what to really expect with such a descent price, it was too good to be true. But the description is exactly right on! Exceptional!
