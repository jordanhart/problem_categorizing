{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Below average quality camera", "Author": "John Hollingsworth", "ReviewID": "RSG0S1CIZPJ3B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera has a lot of nice design ideas but is not quite ready for the general user.  The biggest problems are:(1) The camera does not retain its settings when it loses power or resets.(2) The color is quite poor for a camera that claims to be 720P HD.(3) The web interface is very buggy, crashes often, and then resets to low resolution settings.There are several much cheaper non-HD cameras with better video quality and a better web interface.I will have to keep looking for a true 720P HD Wifi camera.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poor Camera Design and Inconsistent software", "Author": "Sean H", "ReviewID": "R32W2JQEZTQKMZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've spent a considerable amount of time reviewing and purchasing web/network cameras. This was actually my third camera I've purchased and it was by far the worst I've used. I bought the camera because it touted 720p which I hadn't been able to find to date for a webcam with night vision. (BTW, I use my camera in the nursery as a baby monitor in my house). Unfortunately I was a bit disappointed in the hardware but more so in the software that I was forced to use to both install and configure the camera. The software didn't function properly even half of the time and the tech support on their site (Zyxel's site) was pretty bad as well.The camera was is configured so poorly that I wasn't even able to directly connect to it via a web browser.I would pass on this. Logitech has a better 720p camera with night vision. Granted price point comparison may not be the same, but I don't think this product is worth any price anyway.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice but some issues", "Author": "J. Mcbain", "ReviewID": "R3BW707VT14GOI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this for the HD capabilities, but the camera keeps dropping down the regular broadcast resolution. Its very annoying. The software for it leaves a lot to be desired as well. If you use their installed software, you CAN NOT get it into HD resolution. You have to log into the camera through its IP address and change it there.This could be a really great product, but it needs refinements in its software and it needs to stop dropping back into low resolutions at the drop of a hat.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible", "Author": "Kevin R. Davis", "ReviewID": "R103RMGFKCDJ4U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was disappointed you had to establish a pay account for more advanced features.  The record on motion detection is limited since it does not appear to be able to be scheduled during a time interval each day.  I worked around it by not doing the motion detection and just scheduling it to record to the micro SD card for 5 hours each day but now I have to look through the video manually for motion.Update:At this time I'd have to change my review to run away, far away from this camera.  I've found the wireless to be so unreliable that I gave up on it and went to the wired connection.  The wired connection is not proving to be much better.  It worked ok for a few weeks once I changed the resolution down to about half and frame rate to almost the lowest.  But this week it has hung every single day with no explanation.  I've now got it on a timer to cycle the power on it 3 times a day just so it might be usable part of the day.", "Date": "February 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "decent camera once you upgrade the firmware", "Author": "David J Harmon", "ReviewID": "R3HP4S20T96PP0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There's no reason to install their software if you know how to grab the camera's IP off your router. Hold down reset for 12-30 seconds the first time you plug it in; webserver performance improves alot afterwards. Then see if you're due for a firmware upgrade on Zyxel's website.My gripes would be the lack of 5ghz networking (only 2.5), the awkward mounting of the wireless nic on the back, and the buggy firmware it ships with.Update: Had the camera for about a month. Stability is fine. It's been running for weeks and hasn't needed a reboot. Interfaces with an android phone over the internet with numerous free apps.

A tip is to use port 21 and file path \"/\"I have it set to continuously send a pic every 5 min to sensr.net and then I get a time lapse view of the weather.You can also have a motion sensing event setup to only send when motion detected in the areas you lay out.Yes the web browser setup page can lag at times, probably because of the active X, I found using internet explorer the best over firefox, with some patience you can get it setup to your likings then never have to mess with it again.Sensr may cost a bit more but their layout is much more intuitive than the isecurity website.Now given you do need to know or teach yourself a bit about port forwarding and static ip's to setup more than 1 camera on the same LAN but there are plenty of help sites out there to figure it out.Overall for what I paid and the quality of the pic I'm very pleased. I set at it highest and comes through just fine.I do agree that the wifi could be improved but my router is close by so don't have problems with it dropping out.If they come on sale again I will probably get a few more.", "Date": "October 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great HD security camera", "Author": "S.

Mahler \"Solo\"", "ReviewID": "R2QT54GQX2057B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Zxyel must like making bad products and passing them along to users as a joke as they laugh their way to the bank. This camera, like all their other ip cameras, require the user to install ActiveX plugins, download and install VLC or have Java installed.  Sadly, NONE OF THESE OPTIONS WORK. So what you have is a webcam that has to leverage some plugin with an extremely high failure rate. Worse yet - on the mobile side, they require you to install iSecurity+ which is one of the worst applications I have had the misfortune of using.Lets say you bought a Zyxel camera (you sucker) and set it up on iSecurity+. Great. Now you'll see the video size you specified get ignored and the worst settings instead are displayed on your mobile device. And if you made the mistake of buying a second Zyxel camera, then you have no way of adding it to iSecurity+. That's right. Your camera is sitting there looking the world while you sit on your mobile device wondering why the hell someone made such a backwards app that does not allow for adding a second camera.  On the bright side, it allows you to delete cameras.Initially, I thought that Zyxel and iSecurity+ (courtesy of the English impaired folks at Seedonk) were the idiots for making such subpar hardware and software. But after using their products, I have discovered that it was me who was the idiot for not doing my research before spending money.The lesson: don't buy any Zyxel products and definitely stay away from iSecurity+ and Seadonkey, er Seedonk.
