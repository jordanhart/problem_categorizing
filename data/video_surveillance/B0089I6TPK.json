It works partially; as it works like it is supposed to but not like it should.  adjusting the screen to its favorite pop-up state is tied to the actual way it works thereby defeating your setting. Each time you switch between any gear and park in an automatic vehicle where the camera is tied to your backup lights and give the monitor signal your monitor is going to pop-up and depending on how much power gets to it it will reset your setting making you go through the whole setup process again and again and again.....The monitor has a good sharp picture.  But the fact that it resets to multi-positions with each use I will either return it for a stationary monitor or I will super-glue this monitor into my favorite spot and not worry about the pop-up.Make sure to read the installation (wiring) instructions so that you know were to gain your power source.I would not recommend this product.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Install", "Author": "Tim", "ReviewID": "R22WIALVSG53RQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The unit was very easy to install. It comes with double sided tape to mount to dash. When closed it is barely noticeable.I used my radio power to feed it. Do not use a wireless system from the camera. It will cause the monitor to pop up and down at every building with a security system, which is very annoying. I have a Ford Expedition and thought it would save me from taking apart the interior. I bought a long video cable and hooked it up direct. It makes backing up much easier.TIM", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0089I6TPK"}}
