I can only get it to charge on the computer and the light is extremely bright so it was hard to hide at my desk at work to see who was going through my stuff when I am at lunch so I needed to put black tape on the back.  Its still a great little camera and you plug it right into the computer and it plays without having to download any program.  I would buy this again. Its a good product and an excellent price", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Is the worst \u6700\u60aa\u3067\u3059", "Author": "Songjunho", "ReviewID": "RI56DQDXUG2KG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "\u4ed6\u306e\u88fd\u54c1\u304c\u3084\u3063\u3066\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305fOther products cameThis has been a non-built-in memory card implantable\u3053\u308c\u306f\u3001\u975e\u5185\u8535\u306e\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3001\u79fb\u690d\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3057\u305fMemory card in a non-built-in, this was a portable", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "motion picture", "Author": "jessica", "ReviewID": "R2JV41NVVVBTE5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It doesn't record steadily when moving it is 're worded as water wiggly and out of picture.

Although my order arrived as promised by Amazon on the day they projected, there are problems with this item. The instructions are in English and Chinese. However, whoever wrote the \"English Translation\" did a horrible job of translating. The instructions are extremely difficult to figure out, having been written by someone who knows absolutely squat about the English language. And,once you \"Think\" you have figured out the instructions, the instructions are incorrect, and you have to start all over. I realize the item might be considered to be a higher caliber, but if you don't have \"reader friendly\" instructions to operate the item, then why have it? In contacting Amazon, although quite courteous, they have stated that they have no way to rewrite the instructions so that they are actually usable, due to the fact that they cannot check every item's instructions in their huge inventory. Understandable, maybe...but acceptable to the consumer, absolutely not. No attempt was even made to instruct me I could return the item for a refund. I was only instructed that checking instructions before selling to the consumer was logistically impossible. So, I have an item that is almost impossible to figure out after several hours of \"hands-on\" attempts to figure it out. Very disheartening.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Defective", "Author": "Polo", "ReviewID": "R3UXGQ55V38YJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Both pen were defective, I have purchase them before and I dint have any problem but the last two dont work. one only can take pictures and the other one dont work at all.
