{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Video, Useless Audio", "Author": "Boston Buyer", "ReviewID": "R3D696QLTSEIIF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The motion detection feature on this camera works very well and the video is excellent. The colors are pretty accurate, the range (both width and distance) is very good. The only bad thing about this camera is the audio. It is so garbled that it is useless. Regardless of how close to the camera or how far from the camera the subject is when speaking the audio is distorted to the point where no words at all can be discerned. I sent an email to Swann's customer service department asking for some help with this issue but I received no response from them. That was also disappointing. If all you want is good video in a small package this camera will probably do the job for you.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$39.99", "Features": "Includes - ADS-120 camera\n60 foot cable\nRCA to BNC adapter\npower adapter\nmounting screws and plugs", "Name": "ADS-120 CMOS Indoor Network Surveillance Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rFjHn7sgL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BB5TS0Q"}}
