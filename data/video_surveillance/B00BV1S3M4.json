Fast forward to August and the display unit is no longer working - completely unresponsive. When we press the menu button it simply reboots it self over and over. Ugh.The product is marketed to make you think you can easily view your system remotely. You can monitor a single camera via Skype. ONE CAMERA. If you have two or more cameras, you have to CHOOSE which camera you wish to view remotely and then you're stuck with just that one. And no, you cannot toggle through the different cameras. I'm unsure as to why this system only works with Skype, but this means that the other cameras aren't accessible or viewable to you when you're not home. So, if something is happening on #2, #3, or #4 cameras, you won't be able to tell until you come home and view your recording(s). It also requires that your display is connected to a computer that is left ON the entire time. So if you want the display in your bedroom where you can monitor things that might wake you in the middle of the night, you have to have a computer system in there too. Yeah, right. I don't think so.When it did \"work\" (sic) the range was OK - we were able to put a camera in the backyard and get video, but there was loads of sound interference between the cameras and unit even when they weren't that close to each other.You can only put 4 wireless cameras on this system, too. No more. That's it. So if you need a system with 5 or 6 cameras, this system doesn't expand to allow that.We've asked Lorex for a refund for the SD9+ and the two additional cameras (as they're useless to us w/o the system) but we'll see. I'll update this to let everyone know how this goes.9/3/2013:Lorex wrote back and said that because more than 30 days had elapsed, that they would not refund our money but would repair the item. They sent a prepaid UPS label so we'll send off everything (the SD+9 unit and all four cameras) and see what happens. I asked if they found a workaround that would allow us to view more than one camera remotely. Stay tuned for their answer.", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolute JUNK!!!!

Good luck with Lorex customer service...I never did get a human to talk to...so I gave up...not worth it to give Lorex anymore of my time spent dealing with their garbage.

I love that the monitors are so adjustable that you can work out practically any viewing option. The color is very good and no matter how far away, (my car), there is no doubt about what you are looking at. I even get some sound through my windows. I was sad that I could not use them outside my windows because I live in an area with extreme temperature changes and it is not recommended above or below certain temps. Chicago goes extreme, both ways. So I can't use the intercom, but if there is conversation close enough to my home and the inside of the room is quiet; you can still pick it up.Down side? Cords from the monitor to electrical plug are way too short. I have the one upstairs on top of my hutch desk and it is strained and sitting right on the edge. But while I work for hours, I can see if someone is at my gate, like the UPS delivery guy; or my car needs my attention in the other direction. Great view from second floor too. Downstairs, I use the cameras for the front and back of the house focused on the gates and yards. That one is not the exact same unit, but is the same company. I think this is an upgraded one. Again, the downstairs one needs a longer cord but works sitting atop a floor standing speaker instead of mounted on the wall as I would like. Also, this one has the capability of using 4 cameras which is great, but since I only use two, it would be nice to open the view to half screens instead of quarter screens.All in all, I would recommend this Wireless Video Monitoring System to anyone who is looking for visual help around or even in their homes. 4 1/2 stars from me.", "Date": "September 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "A little difficult, but a good system", "Author": "Stretch", "ReviewID": "R2MW7GQ3CJWNEU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The system came with 2 cameras which we installed easily and quickly.

But there were some things about the system that I was not aware of when making my purchase. For example, I did not know that it utilizes Skype for remote viewing, and you can only see one camera remotely.  The motion detection worked well and the video quality was pretty good.  There was an issue with reception and I was not willing to invest more money into the system to buy the range extender (for an additional $69.99) that the Lorex customer service rep said \"might\" help.  The camera with the greatest reception issue was mounted outside above my garage.  I really need to be able to view all 4 cameras remotely.  If it weren't for that, I may have considered keeping it.  I called the Lorex company and was on hold for a long while.

I purchased this system to keep an eye on pregnant mares in my barn that was to far and to much of a hassle to run a wired system.Mine is an SD9+.I have gone through two other wireless systems that didn't make the grade.You'll find them on Ebay,,cheap...This one does make the grade.Set up is so simple a cave man could do it.The wireless range blew the others out of the water.I set the two cameras up in the foaling stall.The cameras are 12' and 24' inside the barn and 10' high.The signal goes through the barn wall(wood),150' to the house,through the outside wall of the house and through an inside wall in the house.Around 225 feet total with no obstructions between the barn and the house.The monitor recieves the signal at the full 4 bars.The video and audio are superb.The intercom feature makes it nice for positioning the cameras if you have another person with you...The monitor is small but can be hooked up to a flat screen tv with ease and lorex supplies the cable to do that.I hooked mine to a 19\" flat screen I bought at walmart for $89...works excellent..It records excellent but you will have to buy an sd card.I don't need the motion detector but tried it out anyway.It takes a few seconds to kick on so you probably won't catch a car speeding down the street but with the right camera positioning you will capture someone or thing sneaking around your property.I don't use the remote viewing skype thing either nor do I ever plan to so I can't comment on that.The cameras are indoors so I can't comment on weather durability.So all in all for range,video,audio this system is a leap ahead of the others.It does exactly what I bought it for with better expectations.Honestly I was amazed.I have had this system a year and a half so far and not a problem.", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's great when it works", "Author": "Priscilla Molina", "ReviewID": "R3DKF13KNTUV0O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "When I first received the system, it was awesome.  Clear picture and audio, quick plug and play.  A couple of cons that I noticed but overlooked at the time being: 1. the monitor must always be plugged in, you cannot charge an internal battery and thus have a portable monitor to carry to different rooms with you (well you can plug into different rooms if you want-so I overlooked this one at first). 2. the degree of viewing seems fairly narrow - having my system outside to view the front of my house, who's at the front door and who may possibly be vandalizing my vehicles, I had to carefully angle the cameras to cover the span of approx. 40 ft wide.  In other words if you want wide angle viewing, this is not the right camera for it.  But after a couple of weeks, the video relay became very choppy then progressed to freezing.  The freezing initially would last under a minute then eventually hours.  One morning waking up to sunlight (8 am maybe), I noticed one of my cameras was frozen at 4 am time stamp!  I called Lorex company and was told by customer service that this is an issue that can be fixed through technical support and returning the system was not necessary.  But after being on hold for 20 minutes then being told through the automated system that the hold time for me was over an hour, I decided returning the system was necessary.  I don't have enough patience to hold for over an hour each time my system needs fixing, especially since my system was under 30 days old.  Returned.

I had a near break in about 6 months ago which prompted this effort.  After some research on line and in stores I decided on this Lorex LW2932.All I had to do was place each camera near where I wanted to monitor (two doors)and each close to an electrical outlet.  Secure each camera and point, then set up the screen and \"WHA-LA\" I'm watching both doors and recording any activity night and day 24/7 even when were away.  Little \"chirps\" let you know the camera's see activity!!! Perfect!!!  Could not be any simpler faster, and convenient!  I plan to add two more camera just because I can now, with out any issues.  BTW with some wire-mold and paint from Home Depot all my cords are hidden and looks real professional.This system does so much more then I expected, like recording any activity on this small video card (no DVR necessary) and keeps rolling over.  See's perfectly at night and the audio works great.  What can you say, quality simplicity, priced right!!!

My husband and I were trying to find a simple system.  After researching different systems and trying to decide what we really needed,  we chose this system.  I have to say it was an excellent choice.  There was no elaborate set up requirements - it pretty much worked right out of the box.  It links up to our TV very easily and you can add extra cameras very easily.  We have 3 going now.  One on our chicken coop (great for observing night time predators), one on the front door and one we move around as needed.  We put a trap out last night and at 3 in the morning saw we had caught a huge possum.  We are really enjoying it and do feel more secure knowing we can keep an eye out on the outside surroundings.", "Date": "April 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great system, easy to set up", "Author": "Guy Lohman", "ReviewID": "R1OOR73D02SDEM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This system was just what we needed: a way to see when someone drove up to our house and walked up to our front door, and to record that event if we weren't at home. Our driveway is hidden by the garage when we're sitting in the kitchen, and we also wanted our daughter to be able to see when someone came up to the front porch and was at the front door without opening it.  This system accomplished all that, AND provides an intercom capability to talk with someone at the front door.  It worked great right out of the box -- the cameras were even pre-assembled and worked great.  Image quality is fine, although shooting through a screen at night from inside gives mostly a view of the screen!  The only challenge in setting this up was getting power to the cameras.  Wasn't a problem for the garage, as I could easily run the wire through the fascia and down to an existing power socket in the garage.  But for the front porch I set it up on the inside, in the kitchen window for now. I still need to mount it outside and run the power line through an attic vent, in order to keep the power line out of reach and mostly out of sight.  I also still have to figure out how to access the system on-line for when we're away.My only complaint (and the reason for 4 starts instead of 5) is that after staring at Lorex's multitudinous web pages on their many confusing models, I tried *numerous* times to call the manufacturer's (Lorex) toll-free line with a question about how the numerous models they offered differed, and how long a 32 GB memory card would record with 2 cameras, and was on hold FOREVER (I mean, over an hour!!). A recorded message recommended that I leave a message to have them call me back, but my schedule made this infeasible, and when I finally did leave a message, no one ever called back.  I decided to take the plunge and buy this model anyway, but COME ON, guys!!  You're losing potential business by being so stinkin' stingy with your telephone agents!  It's BAD BUSINESS to make it so hard for people to contact you, and your web pages do NOT answer all questions!

It would be great, if it wasn't for the \"twilight\" issue.  There is a period during sun up and sun down where ambient light levels are in between the levels needed to trigger IR vision vs. standard color vision, and the camera CONSTANTLY flips back and forth between the two modes, creating a loud clicking sound wherever the camera is (and hopefully that's not a baby's room b/c it WILL wake the baby) as well as wherever the monitor is.  This lasts for at LEAST 15 minutes and the volume of the clicking is not able to be muted on either end.I've contacted Lorex Tech Support and they've said I'm not the only customer to complain about this, but they didn't have a solution for me.  I hope Lorex issues some sort of firmware update to fix the cameras, as it really detracts from what is otherwise a great system.The other nitpick I have is that the IR vision isn't as good as the IR I got when using Lorex's baby monitor system, the LW2451.  That monitor works exclusively in IR mode (no color vision) and it has very good contrast and clear picture.  On the LW2932, the IR mode is not nearly as clear, and when there is something white (like my child's crib sheet), it almost completely washed out my child and I couldn't see him at all, with out of the box configuration at least.  I was able to make it somewhat better by adding a little light into the room (a lamp with a dimmer switch set to around 15%) and adjusting the brightness settings on the monitor, but still, for a product this expensive, it should have equivalent performance as a baby monitor they also produce.On the plus side, the screen is huge, which makes it really easy to see details and the fact that it comes with two cameras is a great value.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ideal system for renters requiring portability.", "Author": "MICHAEL J  EDWARDS", "ReviewID": "R13L6LZ1A9NUJL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Picture was not as good as I would like.Cameras have no adjustment for angle of vision .

I called and a recording told me the wait time would be 15 minutes. I put the phone on speaker and waited. It was 40 minutes before someone came on the line. The technician seemed to know less than I did about this system. She had to keep referring to the manual and she would put me on hold while she went to look at the exact unit they had nearby. I set up one camera in my garage to play with the system before I mounted it permanently. It kept recording every 10 seconds. This is why I called technical support. Nothing I did from the manual stopped it. The technician had me do some things that I had already tried before calling, like resetting the system to the default settings. She said the camera must be at fault so she asked me to take the second camera and put it in the garage, so I put it out there. It did the exact same thing as camera one. It kept recording every ten seconds. There wasn't anything moving in the garage. She told me it must be the unit and it needed to be replaced. After setting up the second camera, the first camera stopped working. The technician told me to call the customer support number early Monday morning. They are closed on Saturday & Sunday. She said to call early to avoid waiting a long time. She gave me a case number to give them. She said they would replace the system. After I hung up with her, I tried to reset it again. The screen would not light up. The blue settings buttons around the screen would light up then immediately go black. I tried several times to get it to work. I unplugged it and waited awhile thinking it might reset. Nothing got it to work. I packed it up. I have decided not to accept a replacement. The monitor seemed to be cheaply made. Also, I like to buy from American companies. If I can't find what I need from an American company, I look to Canada. I refuse to buy items from China. If we want to put Americans back to work, we need to buy American made products first and other counties after. I look to Canada as my second choice. I asked them specifically if the items were made in Canada. I was told by customer support, yes. When I opened up the package, the camera boxes had Made In China written on them very boldly. They lied to me and that angered me. Americans, if we want to battle our unemployment problem, buy American made products first. I look at labels on everything. I started this two years ago when China sent dog treats and food over here that killed our dogs. Before that, they sent over children's toys that were painted with lead paint. Let's put Americans to work. There are made in America lists online, ask questions and look at labels. BUY AMERICAN FIRST! I will not waste anymore time with Lorex. I am looking again for a wireless camera system. I hope my next experience with the next company is better. I definitely want to buy from a company that has better technical support.
