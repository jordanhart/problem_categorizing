{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best DVR for the money", "Author": "Vladimir Kovac", "ReviewID": "R3QBH79CSGKGH4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the most user friendly VDR Iv had so far and I presently own 4 ch 8ch and 16channel. The 8 ch is best of these three. I had quite a few others like Mitsubishi, Speco, Everfocus, GE Truevision, Bosch, Q See, Eye Max, GVI, Pelco and I can't remember them all but if you are not tech guy then this would be the best choice. The mobile app works okay most of the time and setup is not to hard. Costumer support is good, they will even set it up for you. The quality of recording is not as good but some of the more expensive DVRs are not as good ither, maybe just a touch better but you end up paying double or triple price.  I had best success with using Q See QM6008B or Bosch LTC cameras with this DVR. 2 TB HDD will hold about 1 Mo of 16 ch recordings. I don't know what else to say about this DVR. I would recommend it. I'll be glad to help if you have any questions.
