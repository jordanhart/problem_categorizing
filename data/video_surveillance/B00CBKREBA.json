{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Basic camera, but easy to set up, great manual", "Author": "Frankie \"Frankie\"", "ReviewID": "R2UKZLJEZ4DVH3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, the price on this cam has dropped 20 bucks from 120 to about 100 since I purchased 2 weeks ago, so it seems to me a good deal at that price.This is a fixed-lens camera (no pan/tilt/zoom) with a very good quality picture. It comes with a well-written 64-page booklet/manual, with specific instructions in clear English for both Mac and Windows setup, how to access the camera and your router through a web browser, and many helpful tips for different situations. If you've had trouble as I have with cheaper cameras that come with poor instructions, this manual alone is worth a lot. For example, after using cameras of this type for several years, thanks to this manual I now understand for the first time how to set a fixed IP address through my router. This means when the power fails, the cameras will still be accessed properly and record again when the power comes back on.I had very little trouble getting this cam going compared to others I've used in the past (Panasonic and Foscam). I am using Evocam software (on a Mac) to manage my cameras and this camera works very well with that software (I highly recommend Evocam if you are on a Mac).I've had trouble with pan/tilt-capable cameras in the past, when the power went out, they would start up again but would often be pointing in the wrong direction after re-boot and not covering the area I wanted to record. That's why I wanted a basic, no-frills camera where I know the lens is always pointing where I want it to be.I have not used the other advertised features of this camera, so I can't comment on those but given the quality of construction, packaging, etc. of this device I would bet they work well also.", "Date": "August 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$149.95", "Features": "Hi-Resolution PoE IP Network Camera for daytime use\nNatural daytime colors\nBuilt in DVR can record using 1 GB or larger MicroSD card (not included)\nMotion detection or timed emails and FTP uploads\nSee streaming video on your PC, Mac, iPhone, iPad or other web enabled smartphone", "Name": "Sharx Security VIPcella SCNC2606P Cat5 PoE Wired MPEG4 IP network camera with MicroSD DVR", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21BNAoXmuPL.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CBKREBA"}}
