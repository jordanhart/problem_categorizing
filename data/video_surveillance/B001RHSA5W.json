False alerts are very rare and it's very obvious by the strength that it's from a store. On a straight run on the highway I get about a two mile or more warning. On hills and curves that is cut down quite a bit but still enough time to slow down. I love the extra features like the compass and intellimute. The usb port for the gps module is great to have if I ever want red light camera capability. The size is a little longer that other radar detectors but the suction cup mount seems stronger that the $350 Escort I had and the unit does not shake like the Escort did. The coiled cord is nice and is a perfect length for my car. A long straight cord is available if anyone needs that.Overall I'm very happy with the Cobra. It looks great and works great. What more can you ask for? Buy it. You'll like it.(Update)After enjoying the XRS 9945 for a couple of weeks I decided to get the red light gps module. Although I haven't taken any trips yet that encounter red light cameras, I really like being able to put in my own user alerts (up to 1000) and having my speed and more accurate compass available. I feel I have the complete package now.(Second Update)I don't know why people are bashing Cobra radar detectors. The XRS 9945 has worked as well as an Escort 8500 I had a while back plus it has tons of useful features. I read about a $500 Bell and how it knows the difference between non police signals and police radar (different freq's). My Cobra does that at one quarter the price. I had a low end Cobra from Walmart and a mid range Whistler and they were both junk. The only time they would alert to a police radar is when you were withing 100 ft. However they alerted to everything else. The Cobra XRS 9945 is not in that class at all. It is so quiet sometimes I think it's not working. It seems the way I have it configured, the only time it alerts is when it's a cop. Isn't that what we want from a detector? It is a quality, reliable product with tons of features for a great price.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "You need this!", "Author": "FauxStar \"fauxstar\"", "ReviewID": "R3ULMA5EB7ZU7W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Saved a tone of money with this. I'll be honest and I am sorry for this, but I do speed on freeways in America. Sorry, but in my opinion speed limits are way too low here. It's hard to drive on Autobahns with no speed limits one day, and then the next thing you know, you live in America and you have to live with 55/65 mph. So to cut the chase, I've purchased this unit to avoid tickets and to replace my previous lower end Cobra that had a lot of false alarms.Summary:Fake alarms reduced by 90% (besides funny moments such as warning me of Train and Railroad when going to Safeway)Voice warning comes handyDetects highway patrol/cops from far far away, including their most advanced guns, thus saving you a fortune.Beware some officers know their job well: Will not protect you from those smart officers, who know how to ticket you by tailgating you. No detector will help you against that one. Trust me I got ticket that way.Checked legality with friend of mine who is an Officer and found out that these are not illegal in California. BUT:Keep on mind that seeing one in your car will certainly NOT make Officer happy, and it WILL put you in A bad light.To conclude: Well paid off investment. I was supposed to be ticketed dozen of times w/out this. At least I am honest and hope that helps. But don't be me. I still don't encourage you to you to speed and drive unsafely.

It actually doesn't false too much more than other detectors I own (bel 955, whistler pro 78). Definately has less range than those two, but at least it mutes itself without having to push a button like the bel! That to me is a big issue. Reaching up to the window to push a little button while driving can be a little hazerdous! HaHa. It does have nice tones to it's alarms unlike the screeching bel and is fairly loud. It does have a nice coiled cord unlike the whistler which uses a straight one that flops around in front of my radio. The display can be tough to see in daylight at times. It seems to me, Cobra is just putting a product out there to make max profit! Where bel and whistler seem to put more emphasis on quality and performance. And the prices reflect it.

Got this one for the wife to replace another COBRA that didn't cover some of the newer bands ... everyone liked it so much, we upgraded the other 2 drivers to this unit.Chose it because it had the range and features w/o the stuff that costs more that we didn't care about ... touch screen, GPS speed trap and stop-light notification (although it is an available option on this unit), stuff like that.It's always that speed sign you missed due to a large vehicle, or poor positioning, or the one time you are not paying as much attention that you normally do that you get snagged.  I hate that!  They've already paid for themselves by alerting all of us of impending trouble (even when FHP parks past a bridge, angling their cruiser up to transmit his beam in the air across I-75 / Alligator Alley), we still get enough of a warning to make sure we are compliant and safe (because we are not driving 90 - 95 like everyone else).Yeah, we get some false \"POP\" radar alerts, but I've attributed those to the presence of vehicles with \"leaky\" detectors (since I try to pay attention when driving, scanning approaching vehicles for light-bars, lights behind the windshield / grill and the such)  I've decided I'd rather hear a few false alerts than get hit by one for not having \"POP\" turned on.CAUTION:  It is not set up to its fullest potential \"out of the box\", you'll have to enable some alerts to have it do all it can do for you (I suspect a conspiracy, because I've found this true of different brands of detectors that I've purchased over the years ... and this could be why some reviewers gave this one low ratings).So if you get one, or any brand for that matter, DO NOT RELY ON THEIR FACTORY DEFAULT SETTINGS!

I live in a rural area and the only radar I have seen is the Ka band. I mostly bought this because my 2004 Ford Mustang doesn't have cruise control...crazy right...but anyways I didn't want to be caught when accidentally speeding along the many long winding roads I travel daily. For the Ka band radar guns this detector is amazing. It spots the gun about a mile away. However, the thing to note is it works this good when the speed gun is pointed in your general direction. If the cop is monitoring the other side of the road it will give you a warning within about a half mile to quarter mile away. This is usually when you can visually see the cop, but he's not interested in you anyway so that is more than enough time to slow down. As far as false alarms, this does pick up a few automatic doors and random interference every now and then, but the city mode works great to limit the false alarms. This is my first radar detector and if I ever need another I will definitely be going with another Cobra.P.S: One thing that worried me was when I first got the unit there were some cops that it wouldn't pick up. However, I found out that not all cops keep theirs on when they are driving around and some even don't when they are sitting in the median looking like they are monitoring people.

Of the six Cobra detectors that I have now owned, this unit's IntelliShield feature makes it the absolute best at blocking spurious alerts from \"leaky\" detectors in nearby cars as well as from things like automatic door openers and cell phone towers.Thanks to the on-screen/voice prompts and the well-done owner's manual, customizing the programmable features is a snap. I love loud music on my Bose system when I'm in the car alone, and I could have used a note in the advertising about the decibel level of alerts at full volume.

For that matter even at point blank range, the signal strength was only registering a 1. City mode will only pickup a 3 (max 5)or higher signal, but again a 1, and sometimes not even registering when you could reach out and touch the police car in an obvious radar shooting situation.

However, this radar detector does have excellent range and I am very pleased with it.If you live in an area with cold weather do NOT buy the Cobra XRS 9845 because the display does not work until the car is warm.  Then you have to either unplug the radar detector and plug it back in or turn it off and back on for the display to come on, but the car must be warm.

Sometimes it would pick up a police car sitting 1-2 miles up the road. Other times it would not go off until I was 20 feet from the cop car. The X band goes off way too much, often false alarms, and the K band really never goes off. The laser gun also seems to have terrible range. I visibly saw the state trooper aiming the laser gun at me and the dectector still took another 3-5 seconds to go off. However, as mentioned, sometimes it works great. On the trip there was a large curve in the highway, with a police car hiding behind a wall about a mile down the curve.

The screen saver, which is a tracking one-pixel dot, will not deactivate when a detection is made.  My work around for this malfunction is a complete user reset.  I have had to do the reset twice in the last month.  Honestly, I was hoping to get more than only two years of use out of this unit before it started throwing in the towel.  It still detects, it just doesn't show the information on the screen.  With that said, I will tell you a little about this unit when it was in its heyday.The unit is heavy.  It bounces like a rubber ball when it is attached to the windshield.  My family cannot tell if the alert voice is male or female.  Looks like Cobra went gender-neutral when they programmed this voice alert.  The unit detects fairly well.  I live in the country and our Sherriff has nothing better than the K-Band equipment, so this unit does just fine.  Detects the crap out of 7-11 and Walgreen's automatic doors though!  I keep it in highway mode all the time.  I know where the false alerts are located, so I just ignore them.  The screen can be changed to several colors.  I like blue, but since I have been resetting it lately, it has stayed in the default, multi-colored screen mode.  The unit CAN be fitted with a GPS unit, but when I tried to order it, the order wouldn't process.  I tried several times and then just gave up.  I have NAV on my car anyway, so the benefits really aren't worth it to me.  The GPS add-on would probably be more suited to someone who lives in the city.  I think the system can receive updates of speed traps and things like that.Overall, the unit has been pretty good.  Next time, I will look for a smaller, lighter unit.  Oh, and one last thing.  Initially, I set this thing on my dash and let the cord hang down the front of the dash panel.  After only three months of being in that location, the curly cord has already \"rubbed\" a blemish in the plastic fascia of my dash.

Today, I drive long distance to and from work and invariably see three or four inconspicuous and unmarked radar-equipped police cars strategically positioned after curves, downward from hills, and nestled between bushes along roads and freeways.  For these reason I sought to purchase another one.I researched the Cobra and other websites and compared to what other radar detectors offered, but concluded that the Cobra XRS 9745 was exactly what I wanted and at the price I'd expected to pay.  I can hear both the beep and voice warnings above radio broadcasts and can read the warning notice easily.  I use it nearly everyday.  On a recent trip to southern Indiana, it alerted me in plenty of time of every speed trap out there as well as any nearby ambulances or emergency vehicles AND a train, but I could not see it.The only problem is that the coiled cord seems a bit short and the velcro padding failed to stick to my just cleaned dashboard.Regardless, I RECOMMEND this device and believe anyone who purchases it WILL be pleased for making a wise decision.

This is my third radar detector in nine years. The previous two were also Cobras, though they were more like the XRS9445 model, with the single letter illuminating for each alert, rather than a dynamic OLED screed. I was perfectly happy with both previous detectors; they never failed to detect a threat, and they almost never seemed to give false positives. \"If they were so great,\" I hear you asking, \"then why are you on your third one?\" Well, the first one was stolen from my car, and the second lasted years before the speaker finally gave out, though the screen and the detection function were still working fine.Anyway, now that the background's out of the way, onto THIS radar detector.It does indeed detect radar signals, as I can tell every time I drive through the construction zone on my way to work. The compass seems to work reasonably well once calibrated.This is without a doubt the most paranoid radar detector I've ever seen. It never seems to be silent, and I get the feeling that the VAST majority of the detections are really nothing at all. I'm used to having a radar detector, and I'm used to getting X alerts when I'm near supermarkets, and I know where all the consistent \"false alarm\" areas are in my commute. But this thing goes off every five seconds on a different band to the point where it's in serious danger of \"Boy who cried 'Wolf'\" syndrome.My second complaint is about the screen.

On my daily drive to work, I encounter speed traps all the time, and this gets every single one of them. It picks up laser form the state troopers just fine, as well as the other well known ka band. Not really many cops use k band or even x band, so you'll know its a cop when it starts going off. Word of warning though, it does pick up other radar detectors, and will say its a spectre alert. But don't worry! its nothing to worry about, and it's kind of funny watching the other driver freaking out and slowing down thinking a cop caught them. The range on this is very nice! A couple times it picked up a ka band from over a mile away on a straight, and on highway driving expect to slow down almost immediately after you hear the noise, because after they lock onto you, they already have your speed. So on the highway, try  to stay behind atleast one person who is speeding too, because the radar will go onto them, and your detector will pick that up, and give you more time to slow down before the cops suspect you're speeding.

I have driven by cops and the unit did not go off. Why? Because they were not looking for speeders and did not have their radar or laser on.  It works great.  I can't drive without it now.  The only downside is the suction cups suck and the power cord is way to short.  I have to stretch it out to work, otherwise it pulls the unit off the dash.

It's not a Valentine One but it gets the job done for me.  It really only gives you a quarter of a mile to a half mile warning.  If you hear it beeping at K1 or KA1 their could be police radaring you from behind.  I've never had a signal stronger than 1 from behind.This radar does like to beep between K1 and K2 at door openers (frequently CVS).Once you learn how to read the signals and what the possibilities of each one are (depending on strength and type) it's a solid radar to have! Very happy with purchase.  It's saved me about 3-4 times.Update 4/25/13:  I turned off the POP mode as it goes off quite frequently and I never see any police.  I highly recommend disabling X frequencies by putting reading the manual.  It's very easy to do so.This thing has saved me 4 times in the last 2 months so I'm updating to say this thing is AWESOME. All 4 times I was going about 40 in a 30 mph zone with a 20 mph school zone approaching.  Each time I was unable to contain my excitement, I was yelling \"OH YEAH!!\" after passing the cops because they were unable to get me speeding.  I have gotten readings on the highway but I wasn't speeding as traffic slowed down enough to warn me there was something up ahead.One feature I've come to love is the mute button.  In the second setting (pressing the mute button while no radar is being detected) it will cut the radar volume in half after 5 beeps.  This is great when I have people in the car and they don't want to hear this thing beep.  When I'm by myself I put it on the first setting so it beeps at a constant volume.Overall, on a budget this thing rocks.  Gives you a heads up (not a terribly long one but definitely good enough) as to slow down.

Very detailed instruction book, but once I was done reading it, I decided to stick with the factory defaults that are already programmed in.If you do go with the defaults, you should know that the function which defeats the radar detector detectors that some states use is not a default setting.  You will have to turn that function on using the instruction book.I have since been alerted to every kind of radar used by every police force between my house and where I work, and none of them are using POP.  It does not take long to learn to recognize what is being detected and who it is.You quickly learn which police force uses which radar, and which alerts are not police radar.  Generic alerts like \"X1\" and \"K1\" are usually from something like a store's infrared doors or a security system.  You quickly learn where those are.  Police radars give more specific alerts like \"Ka1\".  And the closer you are to the radar, the faster the detector beeps.I have had some alerts at traffic intersections which have those detectors for emergency vehicles, or maybe they are cameras which take your photo if you go through a red light.  I don't know.Emergency vehicles also alert the detector since many of them now emit a signal to change traffic lights for them.Very, very easy to operate and learn to use.Two annoyances:1.

I had to program all of it's features which I never had to do before. Not sure I like that, I feel like I might not have done it right. But it detects like it is suppose to. It even spotted a couple of would be ticket writers that I didn't spot. My previous one was voice activated which is a feature I miss. But this one has something my prior one does not. It lowers the volume of itself after a couple of beeps. Which is great because that can be rather annoying, you know the constant loud beep.

I'm ALWAYS able to see the cop car or radar post before Cobra warns me (around 5 seconds for Cobra to respond).

I purchased it for several reasons but the primary ones were, a good effective range, 15 bands of detection and it also works on radar and laser speed guns.I don't generally speed and try to drive carefully so the primary reason for this in my vehicle is to keep me alert.  Like most people, when the speed is 45 MPH I drive 45 MPH but that can get you in trouble when you enter one of the 12 school zones within 5 miles of our home.  The speed limits drop to 25 MPH during certain times of the day and while I try to always go slow I am just glad to have this in the window for a backup to my speed awareness.Like most radar detectors it goes off too much and for many reasons.  It can be set off by some banks that have radar motion detectors, store automatic doors and several other reasons.  I don't care because it makes me slow down and be more observant of what is around me.  Once you get used to it being there it is a trusted friend that is just one of the tools you use while driving.The range is very good as in the areas we live in the roads are mostly straight and it will detect radar from \u00bd mile to over a mile away from your car.  It has saved me multiple times from getting a ticket and in that way I have become accustomed to trusting it as a reliable device.

K band and x band are rarely false alerts. Even if it's a door, it's not a false alert.Bells and whistles-- The 360 detection has a blind spot on the driver side.
