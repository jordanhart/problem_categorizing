I have 16 cameras set up to them and access them from my phone, my computer, over the internet (have a static IP at my house) and love them. I have a cabin that I was going to put up about 8 cameras so I got this DVR thinking it would work the same. I set it all up and can access it from my computer, but NOT my phone unless I use their useless app. I have an Android Phone and my wife has an iPhone. I use an app called IPCamViewer Pro and is the best out there. I have 2 homes and my cabin running on it with over 50 cameras and can easily view/keep track of everything. I ended up sending back this Night Owl DVR and buying a different Night Owl 8 channel DVR, but had the same problem. Apparently after talking to Night Owl customer support, they use 3 ports for some reason on their mobile access and every app out there (but theirs of course) only uses 2 ports. So I switched and went with a Zmodo 8 channel DVR and got it all set up. It works with my phone just fine and looks like the exact same DVR, just different firmware, but obviously made in the same Chinese factory/specs. I have been happy with the Zmodo DVR and installed my own Hard Drive (which I would recommend doing because you can get a better hard drive and it only takes 3 minutes to do).Installing the hard drive is EASY! You just take out the 5 screws to the case, then plug the 2 cables into the hard drive and put the 4 screws in that hold the hard drive in place. Then replace the cover and turn it on. Once it boots up, you click on the \"Format Hard Drive\" in the Hard Drive menu and you are done. No sense in paying extra to get one that comes pre-installed. A 10 year old could do it so even if you are NOT \"tech-savvy\" you can do it and save some money.Overall, if you are going to buy a Night Owl DVR, get their top of the line Zeus DVR, or save money and get a Zmodo.", "Date": "June 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Unit with a very good Iphone app", "Author": "Michael Shayer", "ReviewID": "R347Y7M12ZRRBD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third unit and it beats the others by far.
