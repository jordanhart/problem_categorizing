Set up was easy, and have been delayed by running POC serpentine coax cables to locations for cameras rather than cables shipped, so soldering connectors and putting on BNC ends.  We have one location where I will use the supplied cables since close to DVR location.  So far so good, with only four cameras connected.  Haven't hooked into Intranet yet.  Easy GUI interface.  We will see how long it lasts.  Some DVRs have pooped out within 12-months in some of our implementations.  Has only been installed a couple weeks at present.  All seems fine though and would probably get another as needed.  Pretty much an acceptable/standard unit at a good price.", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "wow", "Author": "will", "ReviewID": "R1BS6YB9Z91M4M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "check around and this was a great price for the money its easy to use.  i would recommend this item to all", "Date": "October 9, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$549.99", "Features": "Support IE browser centralized monitoring and CMS Software for multiple DVR\nSupport Iphone , Android phone remote monitoring\nMultiple channel playback at the same time\nUSB Backup/VGA output/8 Audio input\nColor Day & Night Camera", "Name": "DNT 8ch 8 Channel H.264 Standalone Surveillance CCTV DVR Digital Video Recorder with 8 Color Day Night Vision Camera Security Complete System Package, Real Time CIF Record 240fps, Remote Network Monitoring, Support Internet Explorer, I-phone, Android, Wince, Symbian.
