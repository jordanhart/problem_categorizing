{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Cameras Excellent DVR, TERRIBLE Mobile App.", "Author": "Lisa W.", "ReviewID": "R2QC6QEQR1ZF7Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I used to have a set of older model Swann 4 camera security system with lower image resolution.Bought this system after moving to a new place looking for a security camera system cause I saw this system slightly cheaper than the Swann system I have been checking on.First, lets start with the nice things about this system:-Easy to hook up.  I was never the brightest kid in my classes in any school and I was able to hooked it up in less than 10 mins WITHOUT having to study the installation guy.-System setup was easy too.  Nice UI design.  Pretty straight forward.  If you are good at using Windows you should have no problem working with the system.  The only slightly difficult part was when I was inside some sub-menu and saw some functions that I had no idea what they means.  Downloading their PDF manual from their website took care this problem (at least to a certain extend).-Instruction posters that comes with the system teach you how to forward ports on your router and how to go to a website to check if the port is opened or not.  Very useful.-Smalled DVR footprint and better built quality than some earlier generation DVR models.-Image quality is adequately nice.  This is no GoPro quality but then you are paying the price of less than one GoPro Hero3 to get 4 cameras.-Motion Detection Works.  Instead of having to setup the system to record constantly 24-7 like in some older system which stress out and shorten the life of the harddrive inside you can now set it to record only when the cameras detect something moving.Another useful features.Now here comes the big turn-off part of this system.  The system itself is actually fine, however the company, Q-See in this case, forgot to make a mobile app as good as their DVR camera system.Even I have the correct port forwarded to the correct internal ip address of the DVR system on my network, the mobile app simply will not connect to the cameras.It turns out I have to install a 3rd party add called \"IP Cam Viewer Lite\" (free version) to be able to view the cameras away from home.It's a pity Q-see didn't do a better job on the app cause I really like this whole system.If they could fix this part, I would recommend this system to anyone looking for one.Until then Swann is still the better system to buy.You can find Swann camera system with matching specs (4 cameras 700TVL / D1 resolution, white compact DVR with 500GB harddisk) from both Tigerdirect.com and Costco on promotion but slightly higher price than this system.(Difference between this Q-See system and the Swann system:-Q-See system comes with two 100 feet cables and two 50 feet cables.  Swann system comes with four 50 feet cables-The Q-see cameras are equipped with more infrared LEDs for nightvision than the Swann cameras.-The Swann system mobile Apps actually WORKS!!!!!)(Just don't buy from an Amazon 3rd party vendor called \"aSaving\".  I bought a security camera system with 4 cameras from them and they sent me a system with only 2 cameras.  Then reject my exchange for correct item request claimed that they are out of stock.  Dishonest seller that should be banned from Amazon to protect Amazon's reputation.)", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$279.99", "Features": "Q-See 8CH Realtime 2CIF DVR 4 700TVL Cam 500GB HDD", "Name": "Q-See 8CH Realtime 2CIF DVR 4 700TVL Cam 500GB HDD", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31BoUzLOMmL.jpg", "ProductID": "B00GOYM1T4"}}
