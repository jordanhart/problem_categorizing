I love this drive!  It is very quiet which is great because I use my TiVo HD in my bedroom!My PC is old and doesn't have SATA ports.  I connect SATA drives to my PC with a \"Syba USB 3.0 to SATA Docking Station for 2.5-Inch and 3.5-Inch Hard Drives SD-ENC50037\" (see link below).  It supports USB 3.0 and is backward compatible to USB 1.1 and 2.0 in case your computer is old like mine and doesn't have USB 3.0 ports.  It works great!  Unlike another USB SATA Docking Station I tried previously which caused drives to overheat, this one does not confine drives very much and so runs much cooler.  It does require some manipulation to install the drive in the docking station, however.  I highly recommend this docking station over the other one which costs about $6 to $8 more.Syba USB 3.0 to SATA Docking Station for 2.5-Inch and 3.5-Inch Hard Drives SD-ENC50037Following are the steps I used to upgrade my TiVo HD:Download WinMFS software from InternetConnect USB SATA Docking Station to USB port on PCInsert original SATA drive from TiVo HD into slot of Docking StationTurn on Docking StationAfter you hear drive spin up, start WinMFS softwareFile / Select Drive (select original TiVo drive)File / Backup (create truncated backup)Select Backup File: assign a name to the backup fileClick Start ButtonWhen backup is finished, exit WinMFSUse \"Safely Remove Hardware\" in lower right hand control panel to remove Docking Station and installed driveTurn off Docking Station and remove driveReplace original drive by replacement SATA drive in slot on USB SATA Docking StationWait until drive spins up then launch WinMFSFile / Select Drive / select the new replacement SATA driveTools / Delete Format (IMPORTANT STEP)File / Restore / select truncated file in \"HD Backup Files\" folderClick Start (to restore TiVo image onto new drive)DO NOT CHANGE THE SWAP SIZE!

If I had an account with them my post would go like this.Moxi three tunerInternal ReplacementSUCCESSMy Moxi had the following symptoms. Picture would freeze then it would starting up again or error out. Picture would pixilate. Network icons would disappear and later reappear. All recorded shows at times would get dumped by the Moxi after rebooting.  Moxi would show no signal present when it actually was present.Replaced original Moxi hard drive with this Western Digital hard drive (WD10EURX).  Never removed the CableCard. I was able to do the four finger press with the Moxi connected to my LAN. Read some users had to connect straight to their modem which was not the case for me. Maybe because I have a reserved IP for my Moxi. The Moxi must have internet access for this procedure to work. The four finger press brought up the reformatting screen in about 25 seconds. I selected yes for the process to begin. Took no more than 40 minutes to complete. Once completed Moxi asked a few basic questions like it did when I first set it up new. When I got to the program guide it took a few minutes to load (so don't panic). After that all was functioning properly.I made a note of my channels and the shows I record. This information had to be enter in again and the notes made the process easier. The hard drive is quiet. Never had to reset the CableCard all my channels worked again without having to call my cable company. Three weeks later and all is well.

I had been getting corrupted recordings, and random reboots on my Tivo HD for several weeks, so found my way into the HD diagnostics menu (kickstart code 54) and found that the HD was getting bad sectors.  Unfortunately, this is because Tivo in their infinite wisdom, buffers live video to the HD 24/7, so after 4 years, this HD was dying.I backed up my recordings (all 600+ GB worth) onto my PC, performed a truncated backup, restored the backup to the new drive, and replaced the failing drive with this WD 1 TB drive.  And unlike earlier WD drives that I'd read about, this one did not require any adjustments to the spin down function.Once the Tivo ran some mysterious tests on the new drive for 3+ hours, it came right up.  It now shows 157 HD hours available on the new drive.Just last night, I stress tested the new drive by recording 2 HD programs, transferred a third back from my PC and watched a fourth HD prerecorded program - that's 4 HD streams at once.

Tivo does cold and warm reboots without issues.  Running rock solid now for three weeks.", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect Drive for a Tivo HD Upgrade!", "Author": "Ken A. Collins", "ReviewID": "R2KZ0BGK5NP0I6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My TiVo HD DVR got to the point where I often found recorded shows in pieces because the darn thing rebooted itself in the middle of recording, leaving me with two recordings and a 12 minute gap in between (for one hour shows).  Its frequent reboots interrupted viewing.  Researching online, it became clear to me that the hard drive was dying.After finding instructions online at Engadget and TiVoCommunity for how to replace the hard drive and transfer all my recordings from the original TiVo hard drive, I was all set to buy a Seagate drive.  Then I learned that there actually is a difference among drives, and this Western Digital AV-GP WD10EURX one is designed for DVRs.  While I might not think much of a noisy Seagate drive in my computer, I don't want a noisy hard drive in an appliance in my living room.  According to a TiVoCommunity forum posting, WD AV-GP drives rate a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is the quietest.Also, these drives are designed for continuous operation 24/7 with the intent that the data they are moving is video that you are watching, so they don't split up the bytes and move them in the random ways that regular data gets transferred.One concern I had is that the original TiVo HD 160 GB drive ran at 5400 rpm and this new WD10EURX 1 TB drive runs at 7200 rpm so would the faster drive get hotter and since the TiVo HD was only designed to cool the 5400 rpm drive, would this be a problem?  The answer is no.  These WD AV-GP drives are \"green\" emitting low heat so they can easily replace the original drive without an issue.The TiVoCommunity forum posting was last updated about 5 years ago, so its description of running WinMFS, the required tool for preparing hard drives for TiVo usage, only goes up to Windows Vista, so I can add that it works with Windows 7, just right-click on WinMFS.exe and run as administrator.The forum posting warns against WD AV-GP drives saying that they can't be rebooted and will just hang.  The only solution then is to unplug the power cord in the back of the TiVo and then plug it back in.  This is no longer true.  Western Digital must have heard about the problem and fixed it, because I was able to use the restart option from the TiVo menu to test this, and sure enough, the TiVo restarted.  I did not need to unplug and replug the unit.  I did not need to run the wdidle3 workaround program.After the upgrade, I went from 21 HD / 184 SD hours recording capacity to 157 HD / 1,367 SD hours.  Plus, all my recordings transferred from the old drive to the new one since I ran the MFSCOPY command via the WinMFS GUI.Below are some URLs where I pieced together the information to perform the upgrade (I hope these links remain in my comments, not sure if Amazon will remove them):http://www.tivocommunity.com/tivo-vb/showthread.php?t=370784#S5http://www.engadget.com/2008/04/17/how-to-upgrade-your-tivo-hd-with-winmfs/", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic DVR Drive!", "Author": "Doug \"tech guy\"", "ReviewID": "R38DW5TQ49NN8W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this drive to replace a faulty Seagate Pipeline drive in my Moxi 3-Tuner DVR.

It just seemed like the box was trying to read part of the disk and having failures, eventually moved on to a part of the disk it could read. I did some research on how to check the hard drive from the diagnostics menu, and sure enough, the test had failures almost immediately.After talking to TiVo about my options on getting the hard drive replaced ($350: $150 for a refurbished TiVo Premiere and $200 to transfer my Lifetime subscription) I decided to look into doing it myself. Do yourself a favor and search for \"Ross Walker's Guide to Upgrading your TiVo\" on the internet. Ross has captured, in exhaustive detail, the process of upgrading hard drives in most of the various TiVo models out there. Following his instructions was extremely easy and for the cost of a new drive and a couple of Torx screwdrivers, my TiVo Premiere continues to keep on working and now has triple the original recording capacity.As with all of my hard drive reviews, I will update if and when the drive fails.
