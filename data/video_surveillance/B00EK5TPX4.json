After all, I discovered the MENU and MODE buttons behave differently when the camera is connected to a USB power source and when it is disconnected. If the camera is being fed power, \"MENU\" switches between shooting and playback modes and \"MODE\" does not function at all, but if it is off power, MENU brings up a menu screen and MODE switches between shooting and playback.Now I was able to change the language to English.The USB port, which is MINI but not micro, according to the instruction manual, is only for supply power, but it cannot transfer data to PC even if it is connected. A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.The camera is not easily detachable from the windshield. You have to either unscrew it from the mounting gear or peel off the suction cup.GPS? The GPS icon keeps flashing on the screen, but it does not set the internal clock. You have to manually set the clock. What a disappointment.Okay. That's enough. I had no more energy to try using it.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EK5TPX4"}}
