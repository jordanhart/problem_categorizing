{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Tenvis Mini vs Foscam Mini", "Author": "Kaio", "ReviewID": "R2VUX4LDYLGQMH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been making the switch from Logitech WiLife to IP WiFi cams, and the transition has been great; should have done it long ago.  So I've been adding more cams to our system, and decided I wanted one in our garage, so it has to pick up a solid signal through a couple plaster walls, and a thick garage door.  Given the environment, I knew I'd be pushing the limits of any WiFi cam, and on top of that, the cam needed to be compact. So I decided to try out the Tenvis Mini319w and the Foscam FI8909W.  Here's how they stacked up:> WiFi RangeTenvis - When I tested the cam in the house, all was fine.  But once it got into the garage and had to push through all the geographic obstacles, Tenvis had spotty reception at best. The video was stop-motion, and lost signal every few seconds.  Clearly, the issue is the barely 1\" tall antenna; it's just too small to break through and hold a signal.Foscam - The Foscam yielded similar results; pitch perfect in the house, and spotty in the garage.  At this point, one might think this particular setup just isn't possible; the conditions are just too difficult.Just for kicks - I put both my Tenvis JPT3815W and Foscam FI8910W) pan & tilt cams into the garage, and they also had a hard time staying connected at that range, and under those conditions.  Which leads me to the one area where Foscam Mini is truly superior to Tenvis Mini...> Replaceable AntennaTenvis - has a stationary, non-replaceable antenna.  To make matters worse, it only extends about 1\" above the camera housing; fine if your cam isn't far from your router, but downright terrible if the signal has to reach through any walls or obstructions.Foscam - some genius over at Foscam realized that, just because you want a compact cam, doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to replace the antenna. So I got myself a couple WIFI 10 dBi 2.4GHz Antennas, and voila -- my Foscam mini is now mounted in the garage and works flawlessly.  One antenna went on my router, the other went on my Foscam mini.**Note** - Foscam uses male antenna connectors.  I didn't realize this until after I bought 2 antennas with female connectors.  So I grabbed some old cable TV wire, clipped off a 3/8\" sliver of copper, filed it down to fit, and gently inserted it into the antenna's female connector.  Then I just connected the newly modified antenna to my Foscam mini -- presto -- instant Foscam compatible antenna for less than 5 bucks.> Image QualitySetting WiFi range aside, both cams have equally nice video; crisp, clean, good focus.> LensFoscam = 67\u00b0Tenvis = 57\u00b0That 10\u00b0 advantage for Foscam means it has a slightly wider viewable area than Tenvis.  The focal lengths appear to be the same on both; about 2cm - infinity.> IR LEDsTenvis = 21Foscam = 5Clearly the Tenvis has better night vision as a result.  But neither cam has the ability to turn OFF the LEDs manually.  Given how my cam is mounted, I really needed to be able to turn off those LEDs manually.  Since there's no way to do that under each cam's current firmware version, I just taped off all the LEDs on both cams with electrical tape.  I also taped off all visible markings and power indicators so the cams were just little black boxes with a lens.  It just makes them more stealth, plus, where I mounted the cams was causing the IRs to just blow out the video to white, since the IRs were bouncing back into the lens.  This is not a design flaw, it's just how things worked out with the way I needed the cams mounted.  Under normal conditions, the night vision works fine on both cams.  I have plenty of external lighting outside the garage, so the IR LEDs just weren't necessary in my setup.  The video from both cams look good at night, with or without the IRs functioning.  But keep in mind, you will need a minimal source of light elsewhere, if you blackout the LEDs like I did.> Software & InterfaceFoscam has it all over Tenvis in this department.  I have 2 different Tenvis cams, and the software on both is very crude and rudimentary.  It works fine, it just looks like it was programmed back in the 90's.  Foscam's interface, however, is pleasing to the eye, well laid out, straightforward, and very easy to use.  There's just no comparison; Foscam wins, hands-down.> SizeTenvis is basically 3.5\" square.  Foscam is about 2.5\" x 3.5\"  For my purposes, the shape and housing of Foscam fit better where I was mounting it.> Camera MountBoth Tenvis and Foscam suck in this department.  Foscam actually has great quality mounts for all their standard PTZ cams, but the one for this mini version just wouldn't stay in place; the ball joint kept sliding one way or another and wouldn't stay put, no matter how hard I tightened it. Just the weight of the cam alone was enough to make the mount drift out of alignment.  Garbage.Tenvis' mount is also crap. The one for this mini cracked with the first turn of the camera screw, rendering it useless.  And this seems to be a running theme with Tenvis, because their mount for my standard PTZ cam is equally crap.> Customer ServiceTenvis' customer service is iffy.  They seemed friendly enough, but there's definitely a language barrier, coupled with the time difference to China, and the fact that all communication is happening via email, and it all adds up to a tedious experience.I haven't had the need to call Foscam or use their customer service, in part because their User Interface is so good, that I don't feel the need for additional guidance. But I can say that, Foscam appears to have offices in Texas, and when I submitted my Best Offers to them on a popular auction site, both were accepted, and all email communique was highly professional and friendly. So if I ever run into problems, I feel more confident working with Foscam than Tenvis.> ConfigThese cams are not for beginners or the tech-phobic.  You need some knowledge of routing, WiFi, port forwarding and IP addresses to make these cams work.  It's nothing hard.  In fact, I never really read the instructions for any of them; I just jumped in and got the cams going on my system within 15 minutes.  The fine tuning and tweaking, naturally, took much longer.  But the initial setup is pretty easy.> A Word About Blue IrisI recently upgraded to Foscam Blue Iris Professional and it's a fantastic security cam suite.  Very easy to use, and you can control and tweak pretty much anything.  Works with most every IP cam, webcam, and even camcorders out there.  Very nice upgrade, particularly coming from Logitech WiLife, which was just crap.Bottom Line -- Tenvis mini is ok, if you don't mind the wonky interface, and your environment is pretty clean.  The video quality is good, provided you can maintain a reliable signal.  But the short antenna on the Tenvis mini ensures you're not getting very far from your router with it.  Foscam, with its replaceable antenna, is the way to go if your environment is more challenging.  Plus the user interface and customer service is just better than Tenvis.  I'd still buy another Tenvis if I needed a budget cam.  But if there's a deal to be had on a Foscam, I'll grab that one over Tenvis every time. IMO, Foscam is just better, no matter what style cam you're getting.  I sent back the Tenvis mini and kept the Foscam.  It's going strong as we speak, mounted in my garage with that long-range antenna.

O...kay....", "Author": "Willie D Edwards", "ReviewID": "R20HVSSGP7POFA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really wanted to love this camera. Had tons of faith in it. I guess I expected too much. First, the cam isn't as high res as I had hoped. It's just good enough that faces are distinguishable. The cam has to be far enough to pick up what you would want in its viewing angle. Problem with that is that the faces begin to look fuzzier the further you go. The thing that killed any chances of this product getting higher than a 3 star was that infrared glow from the cam at night. I wanted it to be undetectable. This cam screams \"I'm over here!!!\" when the lights are out. Now I have to work harder to hide the cam, or worry that someone will cover or tear the camera up. And don't get me started with the software. If this review hasn't scared you away, there is a fix for the software. Do a Bing or google search for the cam software that the tenvis company has on there website. Just look for the older version. It works.", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "horrible camera", "Author": "Gerald booker jr", "ReviewID": "R15FTHV0XBR1EA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera didn't work its verry cheap and over sized for what its for.don't buy this product.I won't buy from them again", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "DON'T BUY THIS IS A SCAM!", "Author": "kk", "ReviewID": "R25PS0V6U97UKR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this product they sent me the wrong one, when we asked about it they wrote \"we don't have that item\".
