This package is definitely the best! Compared with the CMOS kits I've installed, this CCD camera give me the REAL color. The DVR 's interface is user friendly and easy to use.

The picture is pretty good. I covered my entire property with the 4 cameras and they provide me with peace of mind. I thought the picture was going to be crummy, but I was definitely amazed at the quality. Of course, it is not high end, but looks damn good for the price. The DVR works great and it is pretty easy to set up.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Zmodo Complete 4CH DVR Security Surveillance Camera System", "Author": "Daniel Bender \"Daniel Bender\"", "ReviewID": "R16HIW53YRT92Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The DVR works great.
