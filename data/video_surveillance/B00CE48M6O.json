Second the motion detector only works once, then the unit is off. This wouldn't be so bad except that when you press the button to activate the motion detector it takes two seconds to activate, so if you are in the line of site when you activate after two second it records you for the next couple of minutes and then turns off. I managed to put it around a wall and activate it by reaching around but then comes the last worst part. The battery lasts only about 2 hours and the unit shuts off, and here is the kicker, if you don't turn the unit off manually before battery dies it looses the file it recorded.So unless you can do a disappearing act to activate this and you know exactly when you record what you want and get to turn off this unit it is totally worthless.Look elsewhere for a hidden camera.", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Doesn't work for  what it's made for", "Author": "Jessica", "ReviewID": "R77W8T10T9ZY8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this to put in my office to see if people were taking items from there.
