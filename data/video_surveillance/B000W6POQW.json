You can put the camera anywhere or mount it on the wall and it will record video for over a month.  The videos are in 30 second segments by date and time on the SD card.  It connects to the TV with one simple cable (supplied) for viewing and you can fast forward and rewind like a VCR with buttons on the back.  It can be used plugged in or can run on batteries.  This would be a good nanny cam or in an area you need to monitor for security purposes.  The only bad part is that it doesn't record video well in low light.  So, this is a day time cam.", "Date": "April 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Recorder is okay; Vendor nor so much...", "Author": "David W.", "ReviewID": "R22AKASPDCOQ8W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Defender recorder does a decent job as long as you plan to plug it in for power.  Just don't plan on using battery power, or you will be changing them every two days.  The only real functional quirk I've run into is that to check the video, I need to unplug it from the power (obvious) to take it over to the TV.  But if it is turned off (or unplugged) while recording, the manual says some video can be corrupted.  Yet as you approach it, it will turn on from motion detection (sort of an awkward catch 22).  Anyway, I can live with that I think, just something to be aware of.  What really sucked is that I paid for upgraded premium shipping, but the vendor (JUSTBUYITHERE) took two weeks to ship.  I selected the vendor, because they were near by my Southern California location.  I thought paying extra for priority shipping meant I would have it in two or three days, but I didn't receive the item for over two weeks.  They did ship priority mail, just not for over a week!  Some vendors get it and some just don't.  All I can say is \"JUSTBUYITHERE\" just BLOWS!  I won't be doing any further business with them, and I recommend you don't.", "Date": "September 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Need daylight or min 2x 100 watts ligh bulbs to get decent images!", "Author": "P.

It offers an affordable way to covertly capture and record the events of an area. While such a device may not discourage criminals it certainly may make it easier for them to get apprehended. The Stealth DVR looks like any other motion detector, except for the small pinhole camera located at the bottom. Once activated the camera will record (with pretty good image quality) for a set amount of time. This ideal for use in a nursery (nanny cam), an office building (are the cleaning people stealing the change out of your desk) or other areas where you have lingering suspicions.Pros- Good video quality (see the video portion of the review)- Multi-position mounting bracket- Lots of control on how and when you want the camera to record- The main power source will likely be the AC adapter, but the camera can take 4 AA batteries as a back-up.- Comes with a 2G memory cardAreas for improvement- The reason for a 1/2 star reduction t is that it does take some time and patience to get the camera set-up correctly. The manual is helpful, but you may need to read through it a couple of times.- As other mentioned - this is a camera for a well lit area - once you have a significant reduction in light you start to have issues. A few others have mentioned that they are disappointed in the lack of sound. For me it is not that big of a deal. If you are going to use this camera the video capture is going to be far more useful than the sound emitted.- The video format is not Mac compatible - I used the Elgato 10020840 Video Capture Device (White) to capture and transfer the video to my Mac.Final Verdict - While the set-up can be a bit tricky the Stealth DVR provides impressive video quality. The Stealth DVR is a effective motion activated security camera.4 1/2  stars---Please note that the manufacturer sent me one unit for reviewing purposes---------", "Date": "July 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Okay for the price", "Author": "T.

You can set it to record all the time or motion sensor. You can even set the times it should record if you know who or what you want to check on. The setup is a little confusing, but not too difficult. Once it's setup, it works really well. I set it up for motion sensing recording. The videos are just OK quality, about like most inexpensive surveillance cameras. If you know who you're looking at, it's easy to make out, sort of like a cell phone video recording.The unit is a little bigger than I expected, so it's not really \"hidden\".

Falcioni \"Ducatisti\"", "ReviewID": "R3AOOS44GN51Z3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After a few months with this camera, I have come to the conclusion that someone who is still using a bag phone, owns a tube-type television, and probably types business letters on an IBM Selectric designed this system. Why else would they have an programming system that is only accessible via television? Hello, there's this amazing newfangled thing called the LAPTOP, its use is darned near universal, and it is a bit more portable than my television set. It is also available in a larger version called the DESKTOP, which is pretty much ubiquitous in any modern office. Much more so than a tv.Since this system seems to be aimed at the small business market, why would you not create an interface that could be controlled by an easy computer link? And control it you must, because for some reason, the unit seems to lose its programming relatively frequently, at least my unit does.Although you can remove the SD card and view video on your computer, programming must be done using the RCA to RCA (male) Video Wire plugged directly in to a television set - not into your entertainment system, but direct to the TV (at least on our system, this is the only way I could get it to recognize the camera). The cable is short, and the control buttons are on the back of the unit, so if your RCA plug in is at the back of your TV set, you're left standing and holding the camera at an awkward angle, trying to figure out which button to push while looking at the instructions on the TV.And, here's the worst part, there is absolutely no way to set the camera up and watch what it is doing in real-time unless you are setting it up right next to a television monitor and have it plugged in constantly. You can't tell if the camera is actually recording, even if the angle is right. The procedure (without a TV nearby) is, turn on the camera, walk around in front of it for awhile, walk up to the camera and stand absolutely still for a minute to make sure it's not recording, then turn it off (if it's recording when you turn it off it corrupts the file on the SD card), remove the SD card, insert SD card into your computer, find out the stupid camera is not recording, take the camera back over to the TV set, struggle to plug it in, check the confusing programming and see what's wrong, fix the problem (you hope), take the camera back to it's location and start the whole procedure over again.The motion sensing unit on this camera is strange, it seems to work best at about 5' to 10' away, then works intermittently with anything closer or further away. And about 1/3rd of the time, it doesn't record at all, even with optimum lighting and environment.A security camera that doesn't work when you need it is almost worse than no security camera at all.We also have an older version of the Logitech wireless \"Wilife\" security cameras. We've used it during extended vacations to keep an eye on our animals and it's behaved with very few issues for years. I know people with older homes have some problems with the Wilife system due to their home wiring causing interference (the system using electrical plug-ins to transfer the signal from the camera to the base/computer), but if your home meets the criteria, the system works well. The price of Wilife cameras has reduced drastically since the new Logitech system has been released, and you can purchase TWO Wilife cameras for the price of one of these Defender systems. Because of this, and because of the poor interface and intermittent issues I've had with the Defender camera, there is no way I can recommend it.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent value - needs a better user manual", "Author": "Howard B.

Yes, it requires a TV for set up (I don't see the set up as being completely necessary) and yes, the cords are too short. However, the whole device seems to have been made with little to no thought put into actually designing it. If you mount it on the wall or keep it on a surface, either way, the video jack and one of the recording on/off buttons shows up right on top of the device - visible in plain view. I mean if this is meant to be a covert surveillance device, shouldn't it NOT be obvious to the other person (i.e. nanny) that they are being watched. I even tried to stick duct tape on the buttons that are visible from the outside, but the tape wouldn't stick. From whatever recording I did while testing it, the picture quality seemed ok, no complaints there. I mean it's not HD, but it's acceptable.

I guess if you come from the old-school technology world it's just fine; but for me coming from the modern digital world, I found a number of aspects unsatisfactory and wish I'd know about them earlier.Don't be fooled by the use of an SD card. At its heart this is old school technology. The CCD is 640x480, not high-def, and in low-light it shows the characteristic noisy artifacts of old school CCDs. There is no built-in display, rather you set it up (and view it if you wish) by connecting an old-school video cable (no HDMI here) sending an NTSC or PAL signal over the wire. Configuration is done using 5 small buttons on the back and will take you back to the days of configuring VCRs  or similar consumer electronics in the early 80s --- the sparse display, the clicking of buttons in some non-obvious way to get anything to happen.The biggest problem with this scheme is that when you want to mount the box, you will have to make allowances for some way to run the video cable from where the box is to a TV in order to see that it has view of the area that you want. This may not be a problem if you plan to have it connected to a TV full-time, and are running cable through a wall or whatever, but it's a big problem if, like me, your plan is to use it essentially as an on-going recorder, and to only need to view the footage in the (hopefully unlikely) case of an incident.The other worrying aspect about this being old school tech onto which modern technology has been crudely bolted is that I have no reason to believe that the recording to the SD card is done by code in any way written by someone who understood the relevant issues. What you would like in this scenario is the use of an extremely careful file system which ensures that under no circumstances will the file system and files ever be corrupted (even if the bad guys yank power from the device as soon as they see it). This device appears to promise nothing of the sort --- the manual specifically includes warnings about how you can corrupt the SD card is you do things in the wrong order, like remove power before telling it to stop recording. I mean, WTF? The single most likely response to the device being discovered is having its power yanked, and you're telling me that in that case all bets are off and its recording may be useless?Bottom line is that if you were hoping for a security box appropriate for 2013, this is a disappointment. It does what it promises to do, the old-school stuff, fine; but its pretensions of being relevant to the computer age are just pretensions.One final point to keep in mind is that the box is bigger than it looks, in particular it is quite a bit deeper than it seems from the photos, and the mounting system adds another two inches or so to its depth. It doesn't mount flush against any wall!The mounting bracket is superficially nice --- it allows for a fair bit of tilting the camera angle. However it is tightened simply by twisting a handle as tightly as you can, and to my eye looks like it will wear itself loose and have to be retightened every few months. I do wish a slightly more robust mount had been included --- this always seems to be where device makers skimp.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy setup, acceptable video quality, poor in low

The files were formatted in .asf format, which I had to convert to .mov format to upload to Amazon.The Defender STEALTH1 Covert pinhole surveillance camera masquerades itself as a motion sensor.  This unit has its appeal for those looking to monitor certain areas covertly.  However, its poor performance in low light conditions limits this unit to use during the day time or areas where it is well lighted.After putting it through its paces, I came away pleased with the simplicity of setup, but could see where there is room for improvement.Pros:- Decent video output in lighted conditions.- Recording resolution and quality can be adjusted to your liking.  You can choose a resolution of 320x240 with 30 frames per second, or 640x480 with 12 frames per second.  Additionally, you can select either low, medium or high quality.  Adjusting these values will impact the length of video you can record so.- Ability to set it to record on motion (ability to adjust the detection sensitivity!), manually record (clicking the record button on the unit), or schedule recording (you can schedule it to use motion detection to record, or continuous)- Can either plug entire unit directly into TV using the provided RCA-to-RCA video cable to view content OR remove the SD card to play on your computer.- Ability to either flush mount it to the wall, or use the provided bracket.- Option to go completely wireless (not to be confused with wifi) by using (4) AA batteries instead of the provided corded power adapter.- No need for a separate DVR.Cons:- Poor in low light conditions -- could not see a thing!- Power cable is only 5' long.  In applications where you want to semi-permanently mount the unit, and provide it with a constant power source, the cable would be unsightly, and a dead giveaway.  However, this is minor as you have the option of using batteries.- No ability to view live streams from afar -- might be nice if this could be viewed over wifi.  No real fault of the product as it does what it says it does, but it would be an excellent feature to add.- No indicator lights to show SD card full or battery left.- Would be nice to be able to program the unit by plugging it into the computer instead of a TV.- Relatively large compared to actual motion detectors.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "2.5 Stars - Passable Security Device But Not Very Discrete", "Author": "FirePepper Red \"firepepper red\"", "ReviewID": "R1Y2WDO86I0BD5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Defender Stealth is a well built DVR system that includes everything you need to start recording.

I bought a 32 gb SD card and it recorded a weeks worth of video clips (2700+ of them). I recorded motion only and I think it only used about 2gigs. The video quality was really pretty good (I have it set up in a well lit area). A couple of things I don't like. The area I needed covered was almost directly below the detector. I had to really angle the thing down, but in doing so you can see he top of the unit and the black strip where the SD card goes, as well as the RCA jack. This could draw attention to it. I would have preferred those be covered to blend with the unit.

The set-up is easy, but to use the menu, you must use the included RCA to RCA wire to connect the Stealth to the video output on your television. (the RCA cord is short; I'm using a longer one) The manual's instructions are helpful & explain  how to navigate through the menu & to set the system according to your needs.  You can read Amazon's Product Description to learn about the Stealth1's features.Image: No night vision; the minimum light illumination is 2 lux; as the room gets darker the image quality deteriorates. In a bright sunny room, image quality is great. Our room is 21' long; on a bright sunny day, with the camera  set at one end of the room, it has no problem detecting motion on the other side of the room & the image is very good. On gloomy days, the image gets grainy & in the evenings with a 13 watt fluorescent light on, the image is even grainier in the darker areas of the room, but motion is still detected &  the person is still viewable, but can be very grainy depending on how close it is to the light source.  I experimented one dark evening, with Stealth1 set up in our 21' living room (no lights) approx. 16' from the bright hallway light,  the Stealth1 didn't pick up any motion in the living room unless  the motion was closer to the hallway light. The viewing angle is 66 degrees.Positioning: The unit is designed to be mounted using the included mounting hardware.  However, I'm using it on a shelf.  The base is rounded slightly which makes it difficult to sit on a table. I solved that problem by putting a piece of rolled  painter's tape on the bottom. The adapter cord is  too short, measuring at approx 56\". I'm using an extension cord. Batteries can be used for shorter recording times (see product description). I haven't used batteries so I can't vouch for battery life.Sound: This unit doesn't record sound.Viewing: The SD card an be removed and viewed using a PC. I'm using Windows 7. I prefer viewing the video on the television using the provided RCA cable.Suggested Uses: monitoring employees; warehouses; nanny monitor; convenience stores; monitoring your cash/safe.I suggest that you set the Stealth1 up & do some testing before you put it to use.

Provencher \"ppro\"", "ReviewID": "R17FBY94TPVHY3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Defender STEALTH1 Covert MPEG4 DVR Recording System offers to enable a surveillance solution that is easy to set up and use.In some ways it succeeds, in other ways not so much.First, in order for it to be \"wireless\", you must accept that the duration of continuous recording is only about half a day.  That means the batteries would need to be replaced or recharged frequently.  That's going to be difficult if the environment is remote or always has people in it.  If you go with the wired route, then the power cord is visible unless you can install a plug behind the unit (during the build-out of the space).I don't know how \"stealth\" this unit is - it's very large and a bit larger than most of the motion detectors I have seen.  It's going to be noticed if it's installed into an existing space that has people in it every day.If you want to review the images that are captured, you must take the unit down and retrieve the memory card, or take the whole thing to a TV screen.  It's not wireless so again, you could be noticed retrieving the device.  If it were really just a motion detector, it would not be getting so much attention...And the unit takes pictures at one-second intervals so it's not a full motion video.  A lot can happen in those one second gaps, so don't expect to see a movie-quality surveillance record.  If this were watching entry and exit to a space, it is possible that a car or a person could move past and not even be recorded.The instructions are a little hard to follow, but you can get it set up if you set aside some time and concentrate on setting it up.The unit does not have a flat bottom so it will not stand up securely - it really needs to be screwed to a wall for best results.Overall, it's a little expensive for what it does, and requires a lot of hands-on interaction that in my opinion would make the unit unlikely to be \"stealth\" for very long.I would like to see a wireless connection, longer battery life, greater storage capacity, and the ability to remotely control the unit with an application that could run on a cell phone (iPhone or Android).  With that ability, one could re-program, check battery life, review surveillance, and all without going near the device.

I've been looking at everything so far in High Quality mode so I can't speak to the comparison of the other two modes. I may give an update on that later. Everyone at work is impressed with the quality of videoThe motion sensor feature works well but I'm having trouble getting the setting just right on how long it's to record. I selected the 30sec mode which means the camera will start recording upon motion detected (with Motion mode on) and then AFTER no motion is detected any longer the camera records for another 30 secs. So far the longest little segment I see is 17secs. Update: a 2nd tech said \"No, the 30 secs means you get 30secs of video after motion is detected then it stops.\" Well, neither is happening. I get these 10-17 sec short videos created so I'm not getting either a 30sec video or certainly not 30secs after motion is recorded. But, I'm still trying to figure that out.Will be trying out the other record modes (Time range specified and Continuous) to see how those modes do. Update: Just tried continuous mode on a scheduled recording. Set the DVR to record for five minutes (from 9:15-9:20pm) and it worked great! Don't forget, the time is on a 24hr clock!One construction complaint: if you're going to be using the AC power (which worked fine for me) and then want to unplug the AC cord the plug is half way surrounded by part of the case so you're almost forced to pull on the wire to unplug it which is never a good idea.I've also ordered one of those wild life cameras because it has infared and audio. I really don't think the audio is very important and infared is for night videoing.The big plus with the Stealth over the wild life camera is the flexibility of when to record. If you want to protect your business during non-working hours (say from 6pm to 6am) then you simply schedule that in the programming of the Stealth. I haven't seen that feature offered so far in the wild life type cameras but they may offer that as well.Another good feature of the Stealth is being able to set the Motion sensor's threshold. If you DON'T want a certain object's movements to set off the sensor just go to Motion Sensor mode and note the objects movement reading (monitor needed for this) and then set the Stealth's sensitivity to just ABOVE the sensitivity of the unwanted object. Great feature.Last night I accidentally did a continuous record from 11:40 pm to 5:15 am . I got over 950 short video clips created ranging from 9 secs long to a few that went over a minute and one nearly 2 minutes. Space used was roughly 1.2G with most of the video being high quality, 30frames per second. So, I figure I could roughly get another 2 hours of recording for a total of nearly 7 hours worth. The back of the box says you can get 300 days at High quality but you have to note a reference to a note that notes that's given you're using 1frame per second. Not sure if all that adds up given my results but will try to test more.So, I accidentally recorded me sleeping. Would be a great device to study your sleep habits;especially on motion detect as you could quickly tell by the time stamp on review of the video clips how often you move around at night.All-in-all a great product .

As remarked by others the manual could be written a little more helpfully. The biggest issue (for me) is that you have to rely on an external monitor to program the settings. This means that either you have a portable tv to connect at the location you are placing it or that you have to program it where your monitor is. If you do the latter you place it at the location and do some testing to determine whether the settings are working as desired. This is done by removing the memory card, downloading the images to a computer and viewing how it is recording.A small thing that would get it an additional half star would be if the mounting bracket had two ball joints instead of one which would give it a little more flexibility in adjustment the way in which the unit can be angled from its bracket.", "Date": "September 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Love the product!", "Author": "Jessica P.

The continuous green light and the red light in back of it that goes on when recording is triggered  is a dead giveaway.(3) The video quality is grainy, which makes it hard to identify who actually entered the room.  It must be used in daylight with the light coming from behind the camera in order to get a decent picture.  Not so good at night or in shadows.  Not good in close quarters.(4) The date/time setting is used only to trigger continuous recording at a specified time.  There is no record of the time embedded into the recording.
