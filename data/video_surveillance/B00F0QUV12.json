It's very easy to set up and the quality of video from the cameras is top notch.  You will need  a PC with a monitor to get the full capabilities.Simply use the large fold out poster that comes with the system.  Open the box, lay everything out and go over the details of the installation while referring back to the fold out.  The night vision is really nice out to 75 to 100 feet, after that it's a little hard to distinguish whats moving.  Who knows maybe you can spot bigfoot in the woods.The system is very straightforward, easy to setup and the waterproof cameras are of high quality.

The Q-See system is easy to setup, and includes a large poster like instruction sheet with step by step instructions for getting started. The directions are even in English! (I have seen some only in Chinese or something). I have used this camera system two ways. The first is a fixed mounted system that keeps an eye on our driveway and where the cars and trucks are parked. I have also used the system during a Paranormal investigation by taking with me and using a few of the Q-See cameras and a couple of older cameras from Lorex. I was happy with the system in both instances. The remote viewing option if great to have, and makes it easy to check up on things while you are gone.

You will need your own vga cable if you opt to connect to your computer instead of a tv.  You'll also need an open ethernet connection directly on your router. Initial set up was very easy and I had no problems.  The cameras worked great and the image on a HD tv was excellent.  You can also go online, and after entering your data, you can view through all your cameras, you can even start remote recording if you choose. Currently I am only using indoors, and there is no special wiring needed, everything just plugs in and connects.  The cameras all come with weather shields, but some drilling would have to be done in order to connect the camera wires to the dvr if you choose to use outside (unless you are able to run through a window / screen somehow.)

Adlam \"professional consumer\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZZ3ISVHO3R44", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the opportunity to try out various other Q-See surveillance solutions and this one would be more than adequate for an average homeowner who doesn't need all the bells and whistles, like panning/tilting the cameras. While I cannot comment directly on the ease of installation as I hired a professional to set it up, he did relay to me that it was a rather straightforward installation and he ran into no issues. All told, he had the system up and running in under a few hours (most of the time was dedicated to wiring the system).In daytime, the image quality is much better than I was expected. The image is crisp and clear, but it's better if you have a high resolution monitor (this could also work with a television, but the same should be said about resolution). I was less impressed with the night vision view, but the images were still easy to make out and a license plate was still visible/legible from about fifty feet away. That's a win in my book.As with the other Q-See systems I've used, the user interface and the remote viewing appls are a bit clunky, but it's usable. The system also allows you to monitor a single camera, scroll through the various cameras, or do a split screen with all the camera views visible. A word of caution, the hard drive will fill up *very* quickly if you have it set to constantly record at the highest quality setting, so motion detection or lowering the video quality might be the better option. However, the motion detection can be quite sensitive. The first day it was up, I must have received a hundred SMS messages with images because some random leaf set off the motion detector, which means you'll need to fiddle with the settings to find a happy balance.Overall, this is a quality surveillance system if all you need to do is keep a general eye on your home or small business.", "Date": "February 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Middle range, easy to install.", "Author": "C", "ReviewID": "R280D4P781UGHP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We just moved and ended up having to leave our old system with the previous house.  Although our new house is on a much safer street, we are in a very large and very old house.that has been converted into 2 large apartments.  Each apartment has approximately 3-4 visible exterior doors of which some have been sealed and unused but are still confusing to visitors and deliverymen.  So we decided that we needed a surveillance system to find out which of the total 8 visible doors (of both apartments) packages have been left at.  This Q-See is in the middle-range offering by the company and is also middle range overall compared to widely available surveillance cameras.  It shows us if there are packages or people in front of doors and is definitely better than walking around the building several times a day checking or having the dogs run around looking.  A group of dogs excitedly barking and running around apparently scares deliverymen and neighbours.The image is good enough for what we need, but does not contain as much detail as some of the more expensive and higher end units.  There is no sound recording,  Installation seems to be relatively straight-forward and we have it hooked up to an old netbook.", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "I'm sorry, I wanted to like this, but it just sucks.", "Author": "DjiSamSoe \"Trent\"", "ReviewID": "RO5EUL4G0ZDVL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "1. Very cheap cables, thin copper, easily broken. I had to replace one set. When a bnc connector popped off one end after hitting a snag in the wall. Not Q-see's fault, but better cables would have helped as I didn't tug that hard to pull it off.2. DVR login/config with the remote control provided is TERRIBLE!!! There is a mouse, but I cannot use it because of the location of the DVR. Seriously, this remote is junk.3. Sharing the feeds online to friends and family works, but relies on apps they need to install or activex controls/plugins for browsers AND you need to setup users and permissions. Not a deal breaker, but these users get to see the entire admin GUI and full camera array with annoying \"Not AUTHORIZED\" messages everywhere instead of just a simplified interface containing the live feeds of a selected camera and that's it! Having to explain where to go and what to do in the interface to 75 year olds isn't fun. Just let me share the damn video easily.4. The software web client is ugly and clumsy to work with. The master/substream thing is annoying as hell. I'm on the same LAN, you idiots, DON'T show me the substream, ever! Even if you change it, it doesn't remember the setting next time you get on.5. Searching through the events is tedious and frustrating when at the DVR and not much better when using the web client.6. Speaking of software, the CMS client software looks like it was made by an engineer with a wicked case of asperger's syndrome 10 years ago, and since I couldn't get any live video the troubleshooting guide confirmed it when telling me what I can do in Win2k3 and Vista to fix the issue. Give me a break.7. The quality of the images sucks. 700TVL? Even though it's supposed to be 700TVL and D1 recording, it still looks like you're watching well lit events through a youtube 360x240 filter with \"blur\" turned on. Not impressed with the lack of detail. Your thieves will need to be just the right distance, not too far and not too close, to get a clear shot.8. I likely need to adjust the sensitivity because this thing is constantly tripping on motion alarms that I can't keep up with, and when I check on them 99.9% of them are false alarms caused by reflections.I want to return this so badly and get better resolution, PoE IP cams but it would involve tearing down 400 feet of cable all over the attic and then again having to run cat5e everywhere.

Robnett", "ReviewID": "R33XOZO7GKTHCL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Like the other reviewer said, we wanted to like this system. The main reason we are returning it is because the video is so bad that unless the subject gets within 20 feet or less from the camera (during daylight), it will be virtually impossible for Police to positively identify the perp. The picture is very grainy until they get at least that close. Night vision you lose even more definition but it wasn't as bad as we had expected. So if you need this for close up areas, you should be fine but if you want to mount this on the eve of your house, you probably aren't going to get video worth a darn. Their claims of 100 feet, yes you can see a body but it's a faceless body and even during daylight hours, you can't even positively identify the color of clothing the person is wearing until they get within 20 feet or so. The second reason we are returning is that it's not cooperating with our network so we can remotely view our cameras. We've followed all instructions, went online to try and find help and no go. My husband has spent a full day playing with it and it's to the point that we'd have to contact their support. We chose not to because the video is so bad, it's just not worth anymore of our time.

Quite honestly, just having the cameras up and running is enough to deter most thieves and other intruders. The fact that this unit records all that goes on (about fifty hours' worth) is a huge bonus. That is the purpose of the DVR unit which comes with the package.The package also comes with four very nice, sturdy cameras and I decided to modify the mounting on them. Instead of mounting them directly to the house I thought they would look much better with a pre-drilled flange at the base and so I went to Lowe's and picked some up (thin wood ones that I painted white, the same as my house -- very cheap to buy) and the mounting looks much better against the siding.If you live in the country as I do and you are gone for two and three days at a time, this is a very worthwhile investment.", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Use With Your PC or TV!", "Author": "Pamela V \"\"MS V\"\"", "ReviewID": "R119P1HESQLE6M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Luckily for our family my husband is an IT professional and had no trouble installing this system with our PC, which already has two monitors.  The system comes with a DVR player/recorder and four cameras that can be installed wherever you choose.  You will need to provide your own monitor, whether it is with your television set or computer.Also included is software and two instructional posters that help a novice install this surveillance system.  The manufacturer highly recommends you use a good surge protector, and you will have to provide that yourself also.It took my husband a few hours to install the cameras and gear, including decisions about placement and weather, and overall planning.  Doing the actual set-up was a piece of cake for him, but I would recommend a novice hire a technician to install this correctly.We have this set up to pan from one camera to another, rotating obviously through all four cameras, on two screens.  We're watching the garage entrance, the front door, a side door, and a shop we have in our backyard that stores power tools, lawn equipment, etc.  Visibility is good.We live in a densely populated rural area and do not expect to find intruders, but we are  leery of our UPS driver, and suspect he may have kicked two of our dogs in the past, resulting in broken hips that required surgery.  (He opens the gate to come in our yard).  If we can monitor his comings and goings while we're gone, it will at least put our concerns to rest related to that issue.  Since we've had our cameras up, we have been here when he delivers.I think there is something to the theory that just seeing security cameras, even dummy cameras, will make an intruder think twice.

I really did not know how far they had come with these home systems until I purchased this one. Only negative I have to say is the remote is a joke, but the mouse works great.

Whenever friends or service people need to gain entry to our house, it is useful to have a visual confirmation before sharing temporary passcodes to open the front door.  On vacation, visual monitoring of the property can be reassuring.  And of course, in case the unexpected should ever happen, visual evidence could potentially be very useful.Q-See seems to offer the complete, top-of-the-line surveillance system we have been looking for to gain peace-of-mind and protection for our home and family. The four cameras in the kit are sufficient to monitor all of the entry points into our home. The cameras film under all lighting conditions and record to the included DVR. The kit also includes cables, step-by-step instructions printed on large, illustrated foldout sheets, and window decals in English and Spanish. The DVR can be connected to a router so that we can view any of the four cameras at any time using a Web browser. A nice feature is email alerts which can be used to send notices, for example whenever the camera detects motion.Unfortunately, we must confess to not being very hands-on ourselves.  We will update this review when we arrange for our electrician to install the cameras, cables and DVR.  In the meantime, we have high hopes and look forward to seeing how the project works out!", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$199.99", "Features": "Full 960H and D1 Real-time recording on all channels at 30FPS\nPre-installed 500GB Hard Drive\nStream Live Video Directly to a remote MAC or PC, iPhone, iPad, Android, or Windows Phone.
