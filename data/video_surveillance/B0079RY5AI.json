With a little understanding of networks, this camera was simple to setup.  It is very stable and has a rock solid picture over Wi-Fi.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the audio quality.  The Wi-Fi antenna causes a repetitive buzz in the audio.  Mounting the camera up side down or moving the antenna away from the camera head removes some of the noise but not all of it.  This camera needs shielding between the audio circuitry and the CPU / Data circuits.It is noisier than others when you turn it and it can be heard through the audio loudly.  As for picture quality, both in the dark and during the day it is pretty good for the price point.  The picture in the dark is amazing, lights up the whole room, does better than it states. (~16 feet or 5 meters).  This camera lights up brightly 20 feet away without adjusting brightness or contrast.While it lacks the ability to use sound triggers for recording with their Blue Iris software due to the internal noise and AGC circuitry, this is an amazing camera for the price.  Works very well using motion detection on maximum and doesn't give any false alarms due to picture instability or noise from compression.  Uses about 2.5 Mb/s (megabits per second) Wi-Fi bandwidth.  Most 802.11(G) routers will handle 21 Mb/s so you can put quite a few of these cameras on your Wi-Fi without much lag.  Frame rate for me has been about 15-18 fps which is lower than advertised but still acceptable.", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "da ge is watching", "Author": "W. Wolff", "ReviewID": "RKCW7FCS983U5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Made in China. I'll explain below why this may be a serious issue.This camera works nicely. This is the second one I've purchased to watch the caregivers who give care to my elderly parents.The only software I have to operate it is what comes with it. The software is adequate, permitting me to view and record, with audio and timestamp, multiple cameras simultaneously. The camera operates easily from the software, panning left-right and up-down. The camera can be focused for a range of distances, but only manually so far, since the default software doesn't operate this. I don't know whether the focus can be operated by software.When you install the camera, it is given a local IP address on your LAN. The view/record software operates through your browser. However, with multiple cameras, regardless of which IP address you enter, the software selects the first installed camera. You can then include additional cameras in multiple view windows (4 or 9 simultaneously), but you can't view any single camera. Only the first camera can be viewed individually.Microsoft Windows is the preferred operating system and Internet Explorer (IE) is the preferred browser. Only IE provides full functionality. With other browsers, and hence other operating systems, you cannot access multiple cameras connected to your network simultaneously, you cannot access the audio input or output, and you cannot record. These features are available only with IE.The software controls, e.g., panning and recording, operate on any selected camera. The selected camera's image is highlighted with a yellow border. The other camera images are highlighted in white. This may be difficult to distinguish. When any one camera has been set to record, the record icon changes to a stop icon. When any camera's audio has been enabled for recording, the record icon changes to a stop icon. When another camera is selected, the icons remain in their stop appearance. So you can't tell from the icons the state of an individual camera. If you have turned timestamp on for a camera, the timestamp appears at the bottom of that camera's image. The timestamp indicates \"recording\" and \"audio\", so you need to look at the timestamp to see the state of each camera. If a camera isn't recording or doesn't have its audio on, clicking the record and audio icons turns recording and audio on, even if the icons are in the stop position when you click them. They don't affect recording or audio of unselected cameras. Of course, when they're in the stop position, you can't tell what function they represent, because they just appear as a small square. You must remember the function of each icon by its position on screen.Four stars because I would like better software. Even if I had to buy software, I would give this another star if the manufacturer would tell me what software I can use. (As a computer engineer, I'm considering writing my own. But that's not my first choice. And it won't help anyone else who's considering buying this.)The camera can be given a WAN port for Internet access, e.g., view from a computer, smart phone, or tablet via browser from anywhere in the world, if you know the public IP address, fixed at the factory, port number that you assign, username that you assign, and password that you assign.(Now, here it's important to know that I am a computer engineer who has developed a variety of embedded electronic systems.) Engineers frequently include a so-called back door in their products especially for troubleshooting. This isn't done maliciously, but can be used maliciously. Regardless of the alleged security of having you select a port, username, and password that no one else knows. it is possible that the camera has a back door that can be opened by anyone who knows the key. That key may be known by anyone at the manufacturer. But also, anyone who buys one of these cameras can read the firmware and find the key.This means also that, if such a back door exists, it just wouldn't matter what you were doing with the camera, e.g., watching, recording, or even neither watching nor recording. As long as the camera is powered on and is connected to your LAN and your LAN is connected to the Internet, it can be accessed from the Internet. Even without a back door, it may be possible to hack into the camera, as well as any other device on your Internet-connected LAN.I wouldn't worry too much about having this camera in an area where I wouldn't be concerned about keeping my windows open to the world. But i wouldn't place this camera in any sensitive area.Oh, yeah.

You need to set them up at first with a wired connection to your router, after you edit the wireless settings they are good to go and you can move them anywhere, default IP address for both was: 192.168.0.178, if that helps. They work nicely whether you are on your home router or viewing over 3g, however my lousy Sprint 3g with 2 bars at my house is painfully slow, but still barely usable. Sprint promises \"unlimited\" data but since their 3g is so slow, I now know why as there's no way I can consume inordinate amounts of data on their painfully slow 3g network, Verizon in this area kicks Sprint's butt all over the place speed-wise.The night-vision is very good as is the overall picture quality, I can't emphasize enough how good the night vision image is, it's fantastic, in low light or literally pitch black it's black and white, not greenish as you might expect and goes out at least 17 feet clearly. With decent lighting the colors are a still a bit washed out, whether on a web browser or my iPhone 4s. The Wansview iPhone app from the app store (search on wansview) is free and adequate, as is the web interface provided to your browser, I have since bought two different apps (total $15) that allow more than one camera on the iPhone screen, they are both very good, though no app can turn off the infrared lights which I believe are controlled by the ambient light available, and some don't work with the audio. I recommend the the uFoscam app at $3.99 with the in-app purchase of multiview at $2.99, total is $7.00 and the \"listen\" audio works, not the mic though. Windows users should be aware the \"publisher\" of the ocx control for IE can not be verified and will raise a flag (for those of you savvy enough to not run as the Admininstrator, you'll have to provide the password on over-ride), not surprising given the Chinese origin and low price of these cameras. Linux users don't need the ocx control and the cameras work nicely on Firefox. I recommend Windows users go with Firefox or Chrome, no ocx to download and install, nor any over-ride of an unknown publisher required.I have a sneaking suspicion these cameras have some kind of back-door that allows someone in China to view their output, call me paranoid, but I just feel it.

For the price it has a great resolution and image looks great.  I gave it a 4 stars because I don't know how reliable it is yet... I will update later after I have it for a while.I originally purchased a Foscam, which is very similar but much more expensive, but the speaker didn't work from the beginning, so then I order a Tenvis and to my surprise the resolution and quality of the video and audio where the same, they also were very stable and never went down. So I returned the Foscam and order this Wansview for over $30 cheaper and they all look about the same.  But I like the instructions and the web interface on this Wansview better then the Tenvis.I use this cameras instead of baby monitors and they work much better,  I paid $160 when my daughter was born for a baby monitor (Summer) that is black and white, and looks creepy at night. For the price this is much better option.  I purchase this cameras to replace them since we moved to a two story home and she started sleeping in her room alone for the first time, she feels more safe and she asks me to watch her while she sleeps, that really helped with the transition of sleeping alone. This cameras turned out to be great, the night view looks very clear, and I can hear very well.  Since I'm able to move it around, I can keep an eye to know what she is doing or when she plays with her cousins, and not have to run up and down the stairs constantly.  Now I know if or who is fighting or if they are just playing or making a mess. I have it set up with my Samsung II using a $4 app called \"IP Cam Viewer\" and works great. I also set it up to be able to access it from anywhere, this is very nice to have when i'm not home.I was able to set up this Wansview to send alarm pictures to my email address and that works really good too. I do recommend that you use the instructions that are on the CD and NOT to use the instructors that come with the box.Here are some tips:*  Connect the computer with a cable (not wireless) to the same router where you connect the camera.*  When you insert the CD click on the \"BSearch_en\"*  Open the \"Wabsview NCB IP camera user manual\"*  When you are in the \"BSeries ..\" screen,  under the \"Authentication\" make sure that you use the \"admin\" and the \"123456\"  then update it.  You will be able to change this credentials later when you get to the web interface, but for this set up, you must use this.Follow the steps on this manual, I was trying to follow the little book and was taking me longer.Hope this helps other buyers or parents.

LOLThe manual is definitely needed, and IMHO, worthy of being called a manual...or I guess \"fold out\" quick start guide kinda thing..I used the manual to completely setup the camera to my PC(directly wired to the router), and then the #1 review above for the rest of the config for getting this to work on the wireless from our Apple and Android phones/tabs/etc..I highly recommend getting the app, \"Bi Smartey\" for either Apple or Android. It works MUCH better than just using a web browser..You can Pan/Tilt the camera so that it \"patrols/sweeps\" from the app. You cannot do this from the MOBILE browser interface. So you have to move the camera step by step with every click on your phone's screen...it takes a few minutes to go the full rotation of the camera.That brings up one REALLY important spec of this camera that is either not explained very well...This camera does NOT rotate 270deg horizontally......it is more like 300-320deg!!! There is almost ZERO gap in coverage from side to side..it is great!Also, some reviews said the audio was not working/good/etc..Our's works fine. the MIC does NOT work on the camera(or atleast we have not noticed it yet), but the camera DOES \"play\" sounds when you speak into your phone's MIC.etc..I do think I will \"fiddle\" with this (I am an electrical engineer) to see if I can get a good MIC working on it to be more useful as a baby,nursery monitor...I recommend this camera to everyone I know.

Very good instructions, PDF files or Word, in decent English.  Within 30 minutes of plugging power to it, I pulled the pic up on my tablet via WIFI.  Then I called one of my sons across town, gave him my IP/port address/passwords and told him to hit it.  He was impressed with the quality of pic and the ability to make it tilt and pan.

Sometimes, if I manually started the recording it will stop at a scheduled time.

Despite the poor documentation I had no problem setting it up and getting it working with my monitoring software. At longer range (over 40 ft) wireless communication was somewhat lackluster showing a lot of dropped packets and periodically losing the signal altogether. However it could be dramatically improved using a high-gain antenna or wired connection. Other wireless devices at the same range from the router worked without any of these issues.I ended up hard-wiring the camera which made a vast performance improvement. Effective web device interface offering solid pan/tilt control and a reasonable quality picture other than the fact that the grass showed up as purple and my black sweatshirt showed up as various shades of blue regardless of contrast/brightness controls. Night vision worked particularly well and since it switches to monochrome, none of the color balance issues were present.If you don't care about the color issues and just want a simple IP webcam for security purposes this will do the trick for a reasonable price. I wanted to like this camera but it simply does not compare to the quality of my Foscam IP camera which has good colors and is more solidly built but that costs at least 50% more.Bottom line, its not terrible and the price is right so you get what you pay for, maybe not all of these cameras have the same extreme color problems but judging from one reply to my query in the answer section, I know of at least one other user with the same issue.

Video quality seems good. That's it.Now, the Bad:1. Network settings are idiotic.  It comes \"preset\" with static IP 192.168.0.178, DHCP turned off.  So if your home or work network uses anything besides that, you have to first change your entire network, or find another router (or cross-over cable), change your computer IP settings to the 192.168.0.x subnet, then connect to 192.168.0.178 via web or included software to change it to DHCP or set a static IP, then undo everything in reverse order.  Ridiculous.  Other cameras come DHCP enabled, you plug it in, it gets an IP on your subnet, you connect to it, done. This one, fail.2. E-mail alerts don't work. Again, other IP cameras I have send e-mail alerts just fine. This one will not, using the same settings, as well as every other possible setting (TLS, SSL, SMARTTLS), port 465, 587, you name it, I tried it. Nothing.

You will not be able to find a camera that has IR lights, 2-way audio & talk, wireless, pan/tilt, internet access, password protection, and much more. For example, the next best brand is Foscam and they are more than double the cost.-Once setup there is no maintenance. Simply log on through your local network or anywhere in the world through your phone or computer. You can setup the camera to remember anywhere from 1 to 16 focus points or manually control the adjustment to view anywhere it is able to look at.-The included wall mount can be used in any position. You can invert the camera and easily change the settings to mirror the image and the mount is sturdy and I have never had an issue with it.CONS:-PROGRAMMING IS TERRIBLE! But in the sense you need to know about the internet and routers. Honestly, if you are not familiar port forwarding, remote IP connections, data transfer security, IP addresses, etc, then you will have a very hard time getting the full function out of this equipment. The included CD is only useful for finding the IP camera on your network, but programming it to get access to it through your cell or remote computer takes a lot more doing. Their webpage (for all names associated with this product) is lacking on all setup help.-2 way audo is not up to par with respect to using it to talk through the camera if on an outside network. The camera's mic is good for hearing what is within 10ft of the camera, but when you try to talk back you will have a hard time getting the person to understand you unless you are on an extremely fast home and remote network.OVERALL:If you are reasonably savvy with the internet and programming routers then you can probably work your way through it.

Setting up the camera wasn't that difficult, though you should allow a half a day to get it connected to your wi-fi, put your schedule in correctly, etc. I did not set up the WAN interface because of the possibility of a back door allowing those who know about it access to the camera and my network.The color is very odd.  The camera inverts dark colors, so that a black sweatshirt looks white in the image. This has to be the IR feature, but with all the lights on inside it still acts this way. I have not found any color settings either in the web interface or in the manual. The color saturation level is so low it is almost black & white.The email feature works great and allows you to send the images to multiple addresses. So I set it to email my work address as well as a personal address which I can access anywhere. I can access the interface via my android tablet when connected to my network as well, which is nice.The scheduler is tedious, because you have to click these little 15 minute boxes for all the time you want the camera operating. For example, if you want it operating while you are at work, you have to click four boxes for each hour, and do that for every day you work. It sure would have been nice to just shift-click end points and be done with it.  Unfortunately, my unit would regularly ignore the schedule and start flooding me with emails when I walked in the door or when I woke up in the morning, times when the alarm was scheduled to be off.I also could not change the default \"record to\" folder. It was set to C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents. I tried changing it to another location and it refused, saying \"Set the recording path fail\" in broken English.

It would be much better if the LED's were fully infrared and couldn't be seen in the dark so that an intruder wouldn't notice it before being photographed or recorded.I've decided to return it.

You have to reset it up or reboot it.I would NOT recommend if you are doing wireless access since the camera seems to \"forget\" what its IP was set to.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "too hard to hook up", "Author": "Full circle car care", "ReviewID": "R2BJPEL2STVFP8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "never go cheap you get what you pay for spent 10 hours trying to get it to work . no number to call for help.", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not What It Claims", "Author": "DC - MN", "ReviewID": "R2LY1LC5FHQQLL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am attempting to work with the seller to resolve my tremendous problems with this product. I hope that will be possible.  Whereas it regards the product itself... as an IT professional and computer engineer for 20 years, I would advice against this product, because after extensive testing and attempts to make it work as advertised, I have determined it is impossible to do so. It is not able to do what it claims in any way, or any level. The wi-fi is very unstable and very difficult to set (re-setting a constant issue).  It is not a 'live' feed as claimed. It requires a FT browser IP to be open by user, for it to feed or alert (which is very impractical.  The picture is incredibly poor and frustratingly slow (choppy frames).  I would not advice anyone to buy it, unless you enjoy days and days of terrible frustration and sorrow.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "No wifi on the unit I got.", "Author": "B.
