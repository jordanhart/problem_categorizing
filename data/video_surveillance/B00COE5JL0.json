This system is similar, two cameras and a 7\" monitor which accepts a 32gb SD card.  Set up was easy, just a matter of mounting the cameras and plugging them in to an electrical outlet. The camera's automatically sync'd to the monitor. I placed the monitor about 35' from the cameras and through 2 walls and reception is fine.  The defender system had problems with the monitor 15' away from the cameras.There are a few different modes that you can use with the system and I will try to describe them:1)Continuous recording.  This is what I wanted to do and I was disappointed to find out that while you can continuously record both cameras in 'quad view' there is no time stamp or audio on the recording. I called their support line (one hour wait) and the guy didn't seem to know how it was supposed to work, so I was transferred to someone else and waited another 15 minutes. I finally got confirmation that there is no time stamp and no audio if you record both cameras in continuous mode.  We are currently recording one camera in continuous mode and it works great- it breaks the video up into 10 minute segments on the SD card.2) Motion - I was nearly as disappointed with motion recording with this system as I was with the defender system. Both have settings to record 5, 15, or 30 seconds after motion is detected. I can't comprehend WHY anyone would design a system that does not offer a way to record motion until the motion stops!  Detecting motion is faster in this system than the defender, but neither system catches motion as soon as it occurs, this one starts recording a second or two after it starts, the defender system didn't record until 5 or 6 seconds after motion starts.3) Scan - scan mode, which moves from one camera to another can't be recorded in continuous mode, only motion. These systems seem to get confused when motion moves from the field of view of one camera to another, there is a delay in switching to the camera detecting motion unless it happens to be the one on the screen at the moment.Video is good, if my dogs are running the video is a little choppy but you can definitely make them out. Night video is black and white and is clear enough to make out anything that is in view of the camera.Audio is superb, I can hear people talking 100 feet away. The mic is cheap and some sounds are distorted but you can definitely make out words. It has two way audio capability which was nice when my husband was adjusting the cameras because I could guide him remotely while watching the monitor.Support is abysmal. I emailed the company with a question yesterday morning and never heard back so decided to call them, before you call make sure you have registered the product on their website or you will have to hang up and go register it before they will talk to you.  I was on hold for an hour to speak to an off-shore based support tech who had no idea how the system even worked, it was only after being transferred that I could get a half way decent answer.  Lorex really needs to step up their game with regards to support on a scale of 1-10 their support deserves a 0.I'm not sure I would have purchased it if I had realized how limited dual camera recording was, but that probably would not be an issue for most people and unless they have unique needs (I need 24/7 audio/video to prove that my dogs are not barking when my lovely neighbor calls animal control and claims they are) the system would probably be more than satisfactory.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$380.00", "Features": "Lorex Wireless 4CH Monitoring System", "Name": "Lorex LW2732 7\" LCD SD DVR 2 WIRELESS IN-OUT CAMERA", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JG4aXAfEL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00COE5JL0"}}
