I followed directions, set it up with a cable, and it connected to my iPhone wirelessly. However, when I removed the cable from my router, it would not respond. I sent many emails to the tech website and never got a response. I tried to go to the company website and was redirected to Go Daddy asking me if I would like to register this domain name. I now am faced with mounting the camera and stringing a 50 foot cable to my router. And, we contacted Amazon and they simply referred us to the bogus website.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Easy set up- quick email replies", "Author": "ebbstarr", "ReviewID": "R2KB1Q1ZHM2GKJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't know much about security cameras as this is the first time i have ever owned one. It was hard trying to figure out what is what technically, based on your own needs, so, I came across this camera and wrote the company with questions which they responded to the same day which was automatically a plus for me.When the camera arrived my husband set it up pretty quickly for wireless use but we came across a firmwear issue which I had to email the company to find out about- no problems- quick reply with the download link and instructions to update the firmwear.We have the router about 50 feet away from where the camera is set up and It works seamlessly for remote viewing on my ipad or iphone. The only time I have an interference is when the router acts up on me. Ideally I would have one router set up for the security cameras and keep them separate from all other wireless use.My husband has a PC and I have a MAC, but It looks like the options available with regards to camera settings through the PC are better than on the MAC. Like- on my MAC, I don't have the ability to zoom in on a live stream where on the PC it does.I didn't get around to putting a memory card in yet, so, once I get one, I will come back here and write about the video recording quality.", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EMSOQBK"}}
