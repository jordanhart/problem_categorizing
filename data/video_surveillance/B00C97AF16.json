Belkin certainly makes a nice presentation with great packaging and industrial design, but unfortunately the product itself operates more like a relic of the 90's than a useful high definition wifi camera.Despite the fact you'll see an iPad in the product description, the app that the camera requires is not a native iPad app.  In fact searching for the app using the iPad's app store will turn up nothing - it does, however, show up when iPhone apps are included in the search.  The app runs in the iphone emulation mode that results in a smaller size image - pretty much negating the \"high definition\" resolution of the camera.But it gets worse.  What's immediately apparent is the horrific framerate the camera delivers even over a local network.  Initially it looks a lot like a convenience store surveillance camera that runs at only a few frames per second. This can be partially rectified by forcing the camera to its highest framerate (25 frames per second), but it stil doesn't deliver consistent smooth video.Things get really bad when the record button is pushed in the app.  The framerate then slows to a crawl.  It's so bad that everything is just a big blurry mess with only a couple of frames per second. I can assure you won't be preserving any \"memorable moments\" that Belkins suggest you can do with this.Audio quality is also lacking.  In fact it's terrible.  Nothing more to say than that.Overall I'd say this is not worth its high price.  Perhaps if some work is done on the app to optimize some of these frame rate issues it might be more useful.  But as it stands there are much better options available at this price point.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Okay for My Purposes.  Quality is Lacking.", "Author": "L.Gildart", "ReviewID": "R2T7LMBG8W2EV2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This was incredibly easy to set up, and the only thing I am using it for is to see who is at the front door (I live in an upstairs apartment).  The camera is fairly well-suited to that task, and it seems to stay connected just fine with my iPhone 4, but I'm not actually using it that often or asking that much of it.  The video quality suffices to show me whether it's the UPS driver or a person here to give me a copy of Watchtower.What the camera supposedly *does* but doesn't do well:It's not good for video chatting.  The video quality, while supposedly HD, is considerably worse than the front camera on my iPhone 4, and audio is lousy.Motion sensitive security:  way too sensitive and annoying.Recording video:  Nope.  It's like a strobe sequence in a horror movie.  Just, nope.Bottom line -> this is not a good value in an IP camera.  As of this writing, it is every bit as expensive as the higher quality cameras that are available.  If it were selling for about 1/3 of its current price, I would add a star for value.  At its current price, it gets three stars for mostly serving its purpose.", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "still needs some work", "Author": "Ms. T", "ReviewID": "R36P4GSSAUGNFE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "*Update 6/15* - thanks to a commenter, I did get it to work with ISpy,  by updating the camera list in the wizard (off to the right, for some reason even with the latest software, all the cameras weren't listed), and then I could use the wizard to set it up.  This also showed me the extra info that was necessary to also get it to work with IPCamView - basically http://admin:admin@[camera ip adddress]:80/goform/video.  Basically the admin:admin is the username and password, then @ipaddress of the camera then :80 for the port that it streams thru.  Using this I think you might be able to set it up with any other camera monitoring software or app you choose, altho I haven't been successful configuring it with anything besides ISpy yet.  I gave it an extra star for that to bump it up to a 3 star rating.  The hardware aspect of this camera is great, the optics are good and build quality is about what you'd expect, but it doesn't perform well in low light, and there is no way to adjust the brightness/contrast (I would really like to see belkin add image settings and even an option for auto image setting that could automatically adjust the brightness/contrast based on current lighting conditions).  Also the software for this camera is severely lacking in advanced features - such as saving to an ftp server, setting up motion detection zones, etc..* original * Wow - i saw the other reviews, but thought, surely it can't be that bad.  It is.  The app has virtually no functions and no options.  I thought, well, that's okay, I can use it with IPCamView or even Blue Iris on my computer - BUT NO - it is NOT COMPATIBLE with any other software and apps that almost every other IP camera is compatible with.  WHY?  Why did they choose to limit it like this and render it virtually unusable.  You can't even adjust the image, or set motion detection zones.The app is so basic that you can only log in, and view the camera. If you go into settings you can turn the audio on or off, turn the IR on or off, turn image auto adjust on or off, and set emails on or off and that's pretty much it!  This camera and it's pitiful app mean that it is only good for real time viewing - forget about it if you want to record anything automatically or use it for any kind of home security.  Maybe Belkin will wise up and add some better features in the future, but as it is, this camera is really not good for much other than viewing real time activity.  And because it's not compatible with other software besides Belkin's own, you can't use it to mix and match with other cameras in your home security system.  Trendnet and Foscam both have similar cameras that have all the features this is missing.  IE - the ability to record to SD card or computer when motion is detected, the ability to use it with any software and app that you prefer - and I believe both of them are similar, if not cheaper in price than this Belkin.  I may be trying one of those two for my next WIFI camera.  The logitech alert cameras are more expensive, but also have a much higher feature set than this, as well as really nice desktop software for recording activity and scheduling alerts, etc.Motion detection alerts seem to work okay and it will email you two frames at the time it is triggered, but again, since this is meant for phone/tablet use only, why only email alerts?  There should be an option to have it send push notifications so you can look right away and not have to wait for an email to come thru.  And without it having the capability to automatically record when motion is detected, it is useless unless you happen to be able to drop everything and go into the app and press the record button. If someone breaks into your house - forget it, you cannot have it record them ripping off your stuff so you can give the video to the police.  This makes it basically a glorified nanny cam or pet cam.  And if that's all you want it for, I would get something a lot cheaper than this.Also, at this price point, I feel like it should have an sd card slot to record motion events to, but unfortunately it does not.These Belkin cameras seem to be released prematurely - they advertise easy setup, and sure that is true, it is easy to setup because they are so limited in functionality.  I think they are planning on these cameras as part of a whole home automation system, but right now I would say they are in pre-beta stage and have a lot of work to do - they are starting out with less than other makers have had available for years. I'll be interested to see if they improve functionality of these over time.It does deserve at least one star, because it is so simple to setup that any novice user can do it, and for those that don't want to have to mess with port forwarding, dynamic dns, etc but still want to view their camera from anywhere, then maybe this is the best option and they won't mind all the missing features.", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Complete #FAIL product", "Author": "IA", "ReviewID": "RH8EYVNLFXTGM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Love how all the Belkin people have rushed in to thumbs-down my review. Typical.Let's begin. First off all, this is not made by Belkin. It's an off-label brand that they have rebranded as their own. Yet it actually has less functionality than the off-label product.Pros:The video preview quality is decent. That's it.Cons:The software crashes all the time.A 3-second animation plays every time you open the app, even if the app was just idle!The camera keeps losing the connection to the iPhone app, so you need to quit the app and relaunch it constantly.The video recording on the software is limited to about 2 frames per second.The buttons for recording or taking a photo have childish sounds attached to them and they can NOT be turned off. Even if you put your phone on silent.The recording of video stops at random places, probably caused by notifications on your phone.You have to sign up for their service, giving them a username, email and password in order to use the camera. There is NO way around this. This means at any time Belkin can watch your camera!! Now wait a minute, you think this won't ever happen? After I sent 3 emails through the app to Belkin, a notice popped up on the screen of my iPhone stating:Logged out!There has been a log-in of the sameusername and password fromanother computer device.They were looking at my camera!!!!SEE the photo I added above!!I sent it back within 3 hours.

This camera is cheaper and, thus far, more reliable.I liked the ease of setting up and, like the Logitech cameras, I can view things on my iPad.  The difference is that the Logitech records constantly, first to a disk and then to a hard drive on my network.  This one doesn't record, but I can record while viewing the camera, with the video stored to my iPad.At first, the Logitech scenario sounds better, except that I have found it very unreliable.  If I could trade a device that sometimes recorded everything vs. a device that recorded specific things when I wanted it to, I'd choose the latter.  I know that there are times when one is better than the other, but at least with the Belkin, if I check in after an alert and see something of concern, I can immediately record it (and listen if necessary), and know I have it.", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "SKIP IT", "Author": "digitalman \"digitalman\"", "ReviewID": "R2E96PWT1ADG9A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "There are so many webcams out there.

There are numerous posts on the Belkin forums that describe how this works - basically you'll connect to the IP address of your camera like this: http://[ip address]/goform/video. Username/password is: admin/admin. Not very secure, right? ISPY will connect to this style of camera with no issue - just use the Wizard and select Belkin / HD NetCam and you should have no issue. I can't speak to connecting this to things like webcamXP, but it should be a similar process.PRO:Night vision is excellent with this camera. Visibility can be set to day/night or auto and the camera will automatically switch when the light level is too low for normal vision.Responsiveness is quick...movement on the camera is reflected in the mobile app within about 2 seconds, and does not have any significant lag time.Application works on both apple and android products, and is quick and easy to install and use - app is fast and has all the relevant configuration options for the camera plus live view and share.CON:Like other network cameras this one can't be connected to a home surveillance system like a webcamxp or ispy camera device. It creates its own wireless network (which you can't completely customize), and so you must use the Belkin app in order to view the video. This is a huge downside if you already have a home camera solution and just want to add a night-vision camera to it. So if you have a solution, this is a second solution vs. an add-on.Installation is very quick and easy - the camera creates a wireless network that you connect to and configure using the interface, plus the app that you download from either iTunes or Google Play allows for configuration. You can turn audio on/off and quality settings as well.We accidentally left the phone connected to the camera's wi-fi network after config and wondered why we had no internet access - just remember to connect it to your home wi-fi and then move back to your normal setup. You might have to look at the channels of your wi-fi network and move things around so you don't have overlaps, because the camera default isn't configurable as far as I have found. That's another CON for me. I like to fully customize anything on my network, right down to the nitty-gritty.I took two points away for the network inflexibility...otherwise the quality of the camera is very good and in both day and night mode it provides a clear picture with very smooth quality over a mobile connection (4G and wi-fi tested).", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera, unless set up in a window", "Author": "Crystal Hoffman", "ReviewID": "R3OF1R3YZYKO1U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a really great little camera!

So at night time, those lights reflect off the window back into the camera, so that's all I see when I check the camera view.  I can't see my front porch, which is the whole reason I got this camera.  So it's a fine \"security camera\" during the day, but if you plan on putting it in a window, then it's useless at night time.", "Date": "May 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "excelent", "Author": "Wanda L.

I set the Belkin up in my kitchen to view anyone coming in the door and the DropCam upstairs to keep an eye on the dogs.First issue with this Belkin. I literally get over FIFTY motion detection emails a day, at that is a low estimage. There is NO ONE in my house and no movement shown on the tiny screenshots sent to my email. Secondly, there is no notification from the app. So if I have the email settings on my phone turned off, I do not get an alert with sound, which considering the number of false alarms, is probably a good thing. Then the email itself, just shows a screenshot of the (non-motion) versus a live feed (more on that in a second). Using the app, to view any clips that may have been taken if there was actual movement requires a subscription to Belink for their cloud service, which I don't think I really need at this point. My last issue is that for some reason the view on my phone shows on the display vertically so I have to turn my phone to view the screen correctly, which is really just an annoyance.Had I not also purchased the DropCam Pro, most of these things might not bother me as much. But with that, the downloaded app alerts me to real movement, so I can actually go into the camera app and view a live feed or any activities that may have recently happened if I missed them (with pretty good sound). You can purchase the cloud also, but I just want to make sure things are good with my dogs here and there, not really storing any data long term. I also get an email with the same thing, but the link through the app is perfect. I don't get any false alarms and the picture/sound I find much better. The only downside to this device, is that you do need a computer/laptop at this point to do the initial set-up, but like the Belkin it was pretty easy.I am not a tech/gadet person and I really wanted to like the less expensive product.

Unreliable2. No Cloud Support / Recording / Archiving3. Poor Light Visibility / Contrast4. Does Not Perform To Advertised Specifications5. Poor Support / Troubleshooting6. Multiple Failed Setup Attempts.The Detailed Version:This why the camera fails:1. It only functions properly every other attempt to view it's video stream. Most times, the app and phone require a raw shutdown and fresh restart. (iOS 7 iPhone 5).2. No cloud support whatsoever. You may only record video as you are viewing the camera's stream. This makes the camera virtually useless as a security device.3. When the camera does function, bright areas blind the camera. Simply explained, if the subject of the camera is not evenly lit, you will only be able to view the dim areas. Bright areas will appear as a glare leaving the user unable to view the bright lit area.4. The camera often asks you to reduce its frame rate, so therefore it does function in accordance with its advertised technical specifications.5. Belkin's support page is basically useless. Support articles do not exist even though links for the articles are active.6. Set up took multiple attempts before the camera actually functioned.Pros:The packaging and the camera itself are aesthetically pleasing. Physically, it is a well-designed unit.In conclusion, the camera does not function as advertised and the camera has less features than most of its closely priced competitors.This seems to be the best product for the money.

There are no brightness controls.  There is no portrait orientation (only landscape).  You cant even pinch to zoom.  Audio streaming is patchy at best - maybe due to a weak signal. When recording video, the frame rate drops to an unusable level.The app allows you to do motion detection, but that is completely useless.  Even at the least sensative setting it detects every minor movement of a cloud changing the lighting in the room a tiny bit.

I also have (8) WVC80N Linksys cameras which are no longer supported by Cisco and whose email option stopped working after a few years. If you google the camera you can read about the problem. The Linksys cameras require you forward ports on your router which I learned how to do, max resolution is 640 by 480.  I also have (4) Uniden Guardian G455 system outdoor cameras.  They are mounted and used outdoors.  I like them but the max resolution is only 320 by 240.  Each camera has it's pros and cons.  It just depends upon what you need your IP camera to do, figure out what's most important to you.  You also need to assess your ability to configure and use the camera on your system.  I use a MAC, Airport Extreme, Iphone and Ipad.Review:In a related issue,  I've been integrating the WEMO switch and motion products at my home to control lights and to monitor our dog walker.  I stayed from this camera because of the reviews here and other places but when I read that the Netcam product was also integrated with the WEMO line I decided to buy one today and test it out.I had everything up and running in 5 minutes including iphone access.  I have no idea why this is getting so many 1 star ratings.  Maybe Belkin has made changes for the better.  I'm getting email alerts and alerts in the WEMO iphone app.I really love the resolution.  Is the night vision a little lacking, yes.  But this is a very inexpensive camera, and I'm using it indoors and the night vision is good enough.  You certainly can buy more expensive products if you need a \"professional\" or \"commercial\" product.The only downside is the Belkin Netcloud service which is needed to get the email alerts.  It comes with a free 30 day trial and I can't find pricing after the trial period.  But, the WEMO app alerts me of any motion detection so I really don't need the additional emails filling up my inbox.  So we will see in 30 days if I have to pay to keep videos stored in the cloud.  I would like these to replace my Linksys WVC80N cameras one day.Using the iPhone app, you can access the saved video clips  It will also save snap shots and video directly to your iPhone album. I feel like I'm rambling but I really like this camera and am glad I bought it.  Hopefully, Belkin will keep supporting this camera.  I'm a big fan of the WEMO line of products and that is a major advantage of this IP camera.For the out doors, I will use the Uniden cameras.  For inside, the Netcam and Linksys.Hope this helps someoneUpdate Feb 22:Yesterday at work, I must have accessed the camera 10-15 times just to test the Belkin cloud service.  The camera connected every time without fail.  This is the first camera whose soiund has worked flawlessly.  The Linksys cameras sound doesn't work with Mac or Iphone.  This has been a nice addition to my home security and monitoring system.Update Feb 27th:So still happy with my purchase, in fact I bought another one.  I also posted on Belkin's facebook page about allowing you to schedule the motion detection separate from the save video clip feature.  The dropcam HD has this feature without their cloud services. Also, a picture of the last view would  be nice. IMHO, the dropcam HD and Belkin are very similar.  Dropcamm has spent more time refining their app but the Belkin camera is much less expensive.

Trouble started for me when I tried to follow the accompanying instructions (which, by the way, were among the clearest and best prepared instructions I have seen with any product in some time.)  Already one of the first steps failed:  download the Belkin camera app on your mobile device.  First, I tried my one year old Ipad.  The App store advised:  no app for Belkin camera available.  OK, so I tried on my 4 year old Ipad - one of the originals.  It found the Belkin camera App - hurrah.  The cheers did not last long as it required me to sign in to my Belkin account.  My Belkin account?? I had never heard of Belkin before, certainly had no account with them.  Not ready to give up, I found the Belkin site with Safari on my MacBook Pro.  After a little hunting around, I found a place that offered opening an account for free.  Success at last?  Not for long.  The Ipad Belkin App \"failed to recognize username or password\".  So, I changed the password and tried again:  Same result.  I gave up for day one.  On day 2, I changed the password and username a few times, went in and out of this and that Belkin web site on this and that Ipad and MacBook Pro, but the Belkin camera app simply would not load on my Ipad - which seemed to have gathered my username and password in some other, strange universe - so a password entered with MacBook Pro would not work on any of the Ipads.  Most annoyingly:  all this occurred within the first few lines of the Belkin camera instructions - which said only to download the app on the mobile device but said absolutely nothing about an account with Belkin or about usernames or passwords or how they worked only on one type of device and not on another.  The instructions also boldly proclaimed that one needed no computer - only the mobile device to activate the uit.  Rubbish!!  So, sadly, the very nice unit went back in the box and is now on its way back to Amazon - which, thank God, takes stuff back and gives full credit for it.

I'm not quite sure what they expect from a $100 WiFi camera, but I feel that this has at least met many of my expectations at $100 less than a Dropcam. That being said, there is some merit to at least some of what they have been saying.Pros vs. Cons1) The recording frame rate as reported by some people is pretty low, about 2 FPS. I feel that this is more of a software issue than anything else, because the camera streams at a much higher frame rate. By no means is the picture flawless, but there are so many factors that go into image quality when streaming over the web, let alone multiple wireless devices.2) Set up is really pretty easy, I feel like those that have had issues with them either are technically challenged, blowing things out of proportion, or have other defective equipment that is not the fault of this device or Belkin. It really only took me about 4-5 minutes from start to finish, including downloading the app. If you can download an app and connect to a WiFi network, then you should be able to figure this out.3) It has a feature that is completely unadvertised as far as I can tell. It does have the ability to have 2-way communication. There is a feature on the app that allows you to speak to someone in the same room as the camera. I haven't messed with this a ton, but it seems like a useful way to try and calm pets down remotely, etc.4) Night vision picture quality really does seem pretty good. In a relatively dark room I could easily make out everything.5) The app does leave some to be desired, but it is functional. I really wish that they would add some features that I have seen from other cameras. The biggest things that it is lacking is a push notification directly to your device if motion is detected. All that it currently does is send an email with a picture of the action. The second shortfall in this department is it will send notification after notification for undesired motion. We leave the TV on for our dogs to drown out the noise of the apartment complex. The camera detects this as motion and sends alerts all day long. This would be easily solved by allowing the user to block a portion of the field of vision from motion detection. Also, it really needs a time feature where you can allow it to ignore motion when you would typically be home, again avoiding unwanted notifications.6) Belkin currently lacks any outdoor capable cameras, not a deal breaker for many, but would definitely be popular in my opinion.All in all I would buy another one of these, and really probably plan on it.", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazon should NOT sell this product - it wll not work with all Android devices - NO APP for Kindle Fire HD.", "Author": "CarNut", "ReviewID": "R1Y0DSFT0WKAKN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Save you money.

This product was the only one available on short notice so I took a chance.The good:  Software easy to download and navigate.  Camera easy to use, just plug into outlet and point in direction you want to observe.  Settings allow for motion detection for small objects up to larger objects.  Night vision/day vision color camera.Basically, the system works.  I set it up in my apartment, downloaded the Belkin app from the iPhone app store and that was it.  I'm literally half-way around the world and motion detected in my apartment triggers a photo (2) to be taken, and I get an email stating motion was detected.  I open the mail and in a few seconds 2 pictures appear.  I can enlarge the pictures with my fingers,copy to photos, begin a video clip etc.  So essentially if someone enters my apartment I will be notified, can see who it was and can take action if needed.  Plus, anytime I want to see my apartment I simply open the app and there's my entry door. Night vision is adequate to see if door is open but I doubt I could recognize anyone entering at night.  But it's enough to notify me of an event occurring.  The software, one month after installation and activation is flawless.The bad:  Camera comes only in white.  Black is easier to conceal among books, furniture etc.  Quality of HD camera is not very good and the lens should be wider angle.  Even from only 15 feet away, it's difficult to clearly see a photo for facial recognition.  The motion detection is very sensitive.  Some mornings I wake up to find 30 emails acknowledging activation.  For the dollars paid the device does give me some piece of mind that at anytime I can see my apartment.  But lack of color choice of camera, poor quality of picture should give one pause.  Also, to preserve photo or video requires activation of iCloud option offered by Belkin.

Once you move away from your router speeds rapidly drop and you find yourself setting the quality settings so low just to get a decent picture+frame rate+quality combo. Audio seems to fair well when the video is on the lower settings however the auto-detect motion feature needs an even lower setting as I get way to many motion trigger emails even at the lowest setting. If this cameras hardware supported 5GHZ networks I believe most of the video issues would be solved. I understand that 5GHZ limits the distance away from the access point but I think for most end users this would be a welcomed upgrade. Perhaps the relay/p2p servers on Belkin's end could be upgraded as well to help ease the load placed on the end user's device and network. Night vision works fairly well and I feel is the strongest feature on this device.The app supporting this device on iOS works great and is very solid. I have no problem connecting to my cam via 3G/4G/LTE without having to adjust my router with port forwarding etc which is great news for novices looking to add cheap video security to their home/business.All in all it all comes down to how far away this device will sit from your router. 2-3 rooms away on the same floor you should have no problems but once you move further away or up/down a flight of stairs, you will immediately notice a drop in video speed/quality which would happen with any wireless video device really.

The base raises it 1\" in table top mode or if wall mounted the camera extends 5\" from the wall.On the front of the camera is a small aperture lens surrounded by IR LED lamps for night vision and a small slot for the built in microphone.On the back is a single switch for setup or live view mode as well as three lights to identify the status setup/wifi connected/power.The video quality is ok, certainly not HD by television standards, but good enough to get a good view of what is going on in the room as well as identify people. Audio quality on the other hand is not good. The audio crackles and pops so you won't want to use it to monitor a quiet room as you will be listening to a lot of noise. If you need to hear what is going on the microphone does a good job picking up sounds and voices and they are pretty clear over the background transmission noise.Switching to night mode is silent, unlike some other cameras that click to switch in a filter. While the filter may improve night vision on those cameras having a silent switchover is a welcome feature when living with the camera. However the night mode is not stealth. The camera emits a slight red glow from the IR LEDs that is uses to light up the room which work for about 15'. In night mode the image quality does suffer but it is very useable. Don't expect to be able to identify strangers though.The iOS Belkin NetCam app is no frills. No rotation, not even upside down, iphone only you must zoom to use on an iPad. You can access basic setup, turn on sound, take snapshots, and setup email notification which is not especially useful as there is no ability to set a schedule. While sharing is listed in the app you must visit the website to configure this. And you have to do that from a PC, even though the app will launch the website in Safari, the developers at Belkin decided to require Flash to access their website which won't work on your iOS device.I recommend this camera as a buy for watching kids, pets, or the elderly unless you want to leave the audio running all the time. The app and website easily support multiple cameras and multiple accounts being able to view the video. But for security it is a don't buy.

I would give it a 5 star if I wrote this review solely based on what this camera does, but I had to knock off one star based on what it's lack of, which is the capability of Tilt and Pan.

This Belkin offering is in the lower-middle of the pack. Installation is simple, if you follow the illustrated instructions. The Android app for remote viewing works well, though Belkin has larded it with silly animations, apparently to disguise the fact that it takes a while to secure a connection to Belkin's servers. For the truly paranoid, this will be a deal breaker. You have to create an account with Belkin (or, more likely, some anonymous vendor Belkin uses), though you provide no personally identifying information such as your real name and address. Some people will be haunted by the fear that someone may be able to spy on them. Image quality on an 802.11g WiFi network is pretty good, though the frame rate is quite low at between 1 and 5 frames per second. Color rendering and resolution are better than average and the audio pickup is excellent. Infrared viewing (so-called \"night vision\") works well. You can set up the camera to detect motion and email you an alert. It works, though there can be a considerable lag time. There is no provision for real-time recording, though you do get a couple of stills.The Belkin unit does not work with any third-party video surveillance software and is thus useless for real security applications.In short, the Belkin Netcam HD is notable for its ease of installation. It is also easy to use with the Android application or directly from your internet browser. For babycam or similar limited applications for people with limited technical skills (or those who just don't to hassle with installation), this product does the job.

You access it like a wireless point. Sign it up and the whole process takes just a couple of minutes. You can adjust the camera via your smart phone and with your computer. They do not seem to be a duplicate and each method has some benefits. I have turned off the night vision as the red rings does give the camera location away. I do like the ability to check my garage to see if I remembered to close the door.

I even tried closing the curtains (which kind of defeats the purpose) and it still constantly sent alerts.  I regret ever purchasing the camera and just ordered a Dropcam to replace it.

However, this Belkin Netcam was pretty easy to set up as I was up and running out of the box in under 5 minutes. It is great that I can now monitor a room and see it from my iPhone or from the website. The iOS app allows you to take a picture, hear sound or even record video remotely. I am not sure why but you cannot take a picture or record from the website, I would have thought this would have been capable. In my original review, I originally wrote that the picture and video quality were good but after a couple of weeks, the picture quality really is just ok and the video quality is very choppy even though I have cable modem. I think at this point, I would say that the wireless IP camera is still in its beginning stages but if you do need a wireless IP camera, this one is pretty easy to set up but the picture and video quality still has a ways to go.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Spying on your house has drawbacks.", "Author": "G.

Now, thanks to the Internet and Droid and iOS apps you can spy on your house from anywhere in the world. There is no telling how many nannies have gotten fired as a result of snooping, but I'd bet it is more than the number of burglars snagged in the act.The problem with these cameras and associated apps is that they are only as good as your WiFi protection. If its hacked so is your security system. So a drive-by burglar can watch you leave for that weekend at the beach and know he has some time to ransack the stuff you didn't take with you.Now the quality if the video image is good. The night vision feature lets you look outside to catch possums, raccoons, and tomcats who venture onto your property, in case your wondering why your pets are on high alert. Because of the nature of the Internet, there is a lag, so it's not exactly realtime, meaning the burglar has already held you at gunpoint before he makes an appearance on your iPhone.In short, if you want professional security cameras, look elsewhere.
