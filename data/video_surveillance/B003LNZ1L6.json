{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Can't complain for all the features it has at its price!", "Author": "justChill \"Knowledge will be the key resource...", "ReviewID": "RQ08PQFA1QY43", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera I got was branded EasyN, but the box art shown on the product info page matches the box I got. Some people claim they have Foscam, Apexis, Hootoo, etc. brand, but I think it's the same camera branded in different brands to accommodate different markets. I admit, it would HELP if you are tech savvy or at least have some knowledge in network configuration to expedite the set up and get the camera running, but that's not required. This camera isn't exactly the most fool-proof camera in the market, but its feature make up for it.The instructions are readable, albeit choppy due to the poor Chinese-to-English translation. OK here's the deal. I'm going to write a lengthy semi-review, semi-how-to for this awesome IP camera seeing the need for an instruction for Mac users. First of all, I am a Mac user running on OS X 10.7.2 Lion and I got this bad boy up and running within an hour. For all you Mac users out there, you'll need to have temporary access to a Windows machine.If you don't have a Windows machine, see UPDATE 4 at the end of this review - then follow steps 3 and forward. I'm writing this review under the presumption that the typical user has no knowledge of MAC access control list or WiFi DHCP client table from your router to set-up the camera it via WiFi. You need it to run the application that allows you to detect and configure the camera's IP. Unfortunately, this application is written for Windows only. But that's all you need a Windows machine for. Once you configure the camera's IP address to work with your LAN, then you can use the web interface and configure a whole sleuth of other options, including the alarm feature, FTP, Mail and other. So without adieu, let's do this!I've taken screenshots to help accommodate the mini guide below. So check out the user-submitted images for 7+ images I've added for directions on how to proceed. The instruction is for connecting the camera to a LAN - I chose this route because my WiFi network is secured over several layers of security (Sonic Wall fire wall, MAC control, etc.) and it's just easier to get the cam up and running through the LAN.0.) Connect your IP camera to your LAN via ethernet and plug in the power supply.1.) Get access to a Windows machine. I dual-booted to Windows Vista via Boot Camp. Make sure this Windows machine has access to your LAN.2.) Run the application with the file name, DevFind.exe - you can find it in the directory, /EasyN F2 series IP camera installation CD/software. My included install disc was a blank CD-R disc!!! so I had to download the CD content ZIP from the manufacturer's web site: \"easyntech . com / ShowDownload . asp ? id = 34\" you can download the manuals in PDF format from the site too).3.) Run the DevFind.exe to locate your camera, then modify the camera's IP address so that it matches your LAN's IP range structure, subnet mask and gateway. The default IP address assigned to the camera should be indicated in a silver sticker located underneath the camera. The same sticker can also be found on the exterior of the box. Basically, the default IP should be something along the line of 192 . 168 . 1 . 126 and access port 81 (it could be different). Since my LAN's IP range structure is 192.168.0.x, I have assigned the camera an IP address of 192 . 168 . 0 . 155. I changed out the default port of 81 to 310. Understand me so far? Once you got that down, click on the \"APPLY\" button to make the changes.4.) Click on the \"OTHERS\" tab under the Equipment Information field. Take note of the information located in the \"MAC\" field, it should be a 12 letter/number string of characters.5.) If you have access controlled enabled in your router, then follow this step. If not, you can skip. What access control means is you only allow certain network devices permission to connect to your LAN. Even if the connecting client knows your WEP/WPA/WPA2 password, they still will not be able to connect to your Wi-Fi unless their device is registered to the access control list. The unique identifier of the network device is its MAC address. If you have this enabled, then add the camera's MAC address you've just jotted down in the previous step to your router's access control list. The convention should be XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX where X is a number or a character from the alphabet. So if your camera's MAC address is 00A8F700F341, enter it as 00:A8:F7:00:F3:41 Update and restart your router after entering. If you have the means to reserve IP address designation on your router, I would do so. Since I assigned the camera an IP address of 192 . 168 . 0 . 155, I would reserve this address on the router to the camera's MAC address so that this IP doesn't get reassigned by the DHCP to another network device by accident.6.) You'll definitely need to port-forward your camera if you plan to remote view from outside. In your router setup, go to the \"Port Forwarding\" page - it's usually under \"Advanced setup\" or something similar. Since I assigned the camera a custom port of 310, I would enter the port range starting and ending at 310 to be forwarded to the camera's IP address of 192 . 168 . 0 . 155 .7.) Next, you should be able to punch in the IP address and port number you've assigned to the camera as noted on step #3 onto your web browser and launch the web-based utility app e.g. 192 . 168 . 0 . 155 : 310. When you first try to access the camera through a web browser, it will ask you for a username and a password. This information is located underneath the camera and also on the box. It's usually \"admin\" for the username and a blank password, but double check your equipment.8.) Select the viewing method; if you are using IE select the first link, if you're using Firefox, select the second link, etc.9.) View your camera, control it, etc10.) Click on the OPTIONS icon to access the web-based configuration app, or punch in 192 . 168 . 0 . 155 : 310 /admin2.htm to access it directly11.) Configure all sorts of other goodies, such as FTP access, Email, alarm, DDNS, Alias, etc.12.) If you want to view your camera from remote (i.e. outside of your home network), assuming you have a static IP, then you need to punch in your ISP assigned IP address, followed by your port. You can find out your ISP assigned address by going into your router and looking at the information located in the \"basic setting\" area. Thanks to daniel for pointing this out. If you have a dynamic IP address, then I recommend signing up for a dynamic DNS server, such as dyndns.org. Be sure to update the DDNS area of the web utility with the appropriate login credential to your dynamic DNS provider.I'm working on the wireless LAN setup, so I'll edit this review once I have a sure fire way to set it up so I can append a simple how-to to help folks get started. Any question, just comment. Again, this is from a Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2 user (at the time of this writing). *** Wireless instruction added, see Update 5 below ***Since I am a Mac user, the IP Camera utility is USELESS (unless you're using Parallel or Fusion to run Windows). I rely solely on the web-based interface to view the camera. It works like a charm so far. The camera's pan and tilt feature is SUPER fast. Of course, that's because I set it at the fastest level; you can set it according to your taste. You can set up the Alarm feature so that its motion detector can pick up motion contingent on how sensitive you set the camera to behave. Once the alarm mode is triggered, you can further instruct the camera to upload screenshots at set intervals to an FTP server and/or email you the screenshots to an email address (see pictures). You certainly don't need to be Cisco or A+ certified to get this camera to work.EDIT: As for scheduling the motion-detector, it works if you set it correctly. From the web-configuration utility, click on \"Alarm Service Setting.\" Set the sensitivity level, etc., then check if you want to have the camera email you and/or take screenshots of events triggering the alarm and upload to a designated FTP server. I checked both. For the scheduler, check \"Scheduler\" to bring up a week calendar with hour. Click on the hours you'd like the camera to trigger its motion-detector, then press \"Set\". Note that the alarm mode won't go into affect after about 30 seconds after rebooting. I didn't know this at first and thought this feature was defunct from factory. I'm guessing the camera is giving you time to evacuate the premise before arming itself. The scheduling calendar is very cumbersome, so it's probably easier to just turn on or turn off the motion detector.Also since you need Internet Explorer to use the ActiveX enabled web interface, Mac users will luck out. The IE version of the web interface allows you to record video (AVI format), take a snapshot, listen and talk through your camera, along with the ability to command multiple cameras. It also appears that the remote on/off switch works with the ActiveX IE control interface, but doens't for the other interfaces. I haven't had time to fully test them.UPDATE 2: I live in an apartment complex where I gave permission to the leasing staff to deliver packages into my apartment when I am not home to sign for it. I set up the camera for motion detection and it picked up the delivery, snap a few shots and emailed to me in addition to continuously snapping shots in 5 seconds interval and uploading it to the FTP server. Simply awesome for $5x.00.I'm so impressed with this camera I'll be purchasing two more units, possibly in white so they can blend with the white walls.UPDATE 3: For WiFi, make sure your router is 802.11 a/b/g compatible and set at 2.4ghz frequency. The IP camera will not pick up your router if it's set at 5 ghz at N-mode only. For MAXIMUM WiFi performance, do not obstruct the WiFi antenna. Swivel it downward if you have to as the antenna is not as sophisticated and is extremely sensitive to obstruction.UPDATE 4: Thanks to Jean-Pierre Ciudad, you can download a program called \"IP Scanner for Mac\" from cnet.com. It will detect the IP address of the IP camera seamlessly. Once the IP address is noted, simply punch it in your web browser to make the subsequent changes. First thing first is to change the IP address for the camera to match your network. You can find this under \"Basic Network Setting\" of the web interface - no need for a Windows machine.UPDATE 5 - How to configure your camera for wireless access: After playing around with the wireless set up, I think I've found a sure-fire way to set up your IP Cam for wireless connection. The first thing you need to do is connect it to the LAN via Ethernet and configure your camera for LAN access, basically if you've got your IP Cam up and running by following my instructions above or through your own mean, you're ready to go wireless. Now the trick here is to keep in mind that when you go wireless, your wireless router will assign the IP Cam a new IP address via DHCP, meaning most likely you will not be able to access the camera at the LAN-assigned IP address. I think this is the main reason if not THE reason why a lot of folks are having a hard time getting the IP Cam to connect wirelessly. Also keep in mind that the IP Cam is only compatible at 802.11 a/b/g at 2.4ghz only. Not a problem with dual-band Time Capsule but you may need to configure your router accordingly.So back to the setup procedure, once you get your IP Cam up and running on the LAN, go to your IP Cam's web UI and click on \"Wireless Lan Settings\" on the left navigation menu to configure the IP Cam for wireless access.* Make sure the \"Using Wireless Lan\" box is checked.* Under \"SSID\", enter your full wireless network name. You may click \"Scan\" multiple times until your wireless network shows up on the list (you may need to scan up to 4 times before it appears) or you can just type in the name of the SSID of your network. If you have Access Control List enabled, be sure to add the IP Cam's MAC address to the ACL.* For \"Network Type\", select \"Infra\"* Under \"Encryption\", select your security type. It's usually WPA2 (AES), but again, you need to do the research on your own network.* For \"Share Key\", type in your wireless network access password.Click SET and let the IP Cam reboot (30 secs). Next disconnect the Ethernet cable from the IP Cam and power down the camera, wait 30 seconds. Reconnect the power supply but leave the Ethernet cable unplugged and wait another 30 seconds for the IP Cam to boot up. Now your IP Cam should be connected to your wireless network. Run IP Scanner 2.5 or above to discover the newly assigned WAN IP address on the network (you can find this in your router's DHCP list via your router's admin page as well); this should be the new wireless IP address for your IP Camera. If the WAN IP for the IP Cam is 192 . 168 . 0 . 4, then you'll need to punch in 192 . 168 . 0 . 4 : 80 (or 192 . 168 . 0 . 4 : 81) to regain access to the web UI - again, your LAN assigned IP for the camera will usually no longer work. If you've changed the default access port for the IP Camera to something else other than 81, be sure to use the custom port instead when accessing the new wireless IP address. If you plan on a 100% wireless connection you'll need to reconfigure your port forwarding settings, reserved IP setting (if you did this for LAN), access port, etc. Proceed with your WiFi configuration as if you're configuring the IP Cam for the first time on LAN. If you're considering an outdoor IP camera solution, be sure to check out my Agasio M105I Outdoor Wireless Wifi Waterproof Bullet IP Camera with IR-Cut Filter, Two-way Audio, Night-Vision, Email & review.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "I Love IT!", "Author": "hotrod13 \"Can't means won't try!\"", "ReviewID": "R2EN77LP7S6PE7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me preface this review by saying:I) This is one of the best purchases I ever made -- as other reviewers may have already said, the cheap price you pay (I paid $50 for mine) gets you a quality product, a rare commodity these days.II) This item is solidly built and for its price, it has many good features: full rotation scan, e-mail and ftp capabilities, remote administration and much more.III) Yes, installation does require you to have a bit of a working network knowledge -- if you know how to set up a home LAN or WLAN and configure a router, you probably wouldn't need the manual it came with as it is pretty much useless.IV) You can go to Wansview.com, on the \"Service and Support\" menu, there's a \"Download\" link that you can click on to get to the full user manuals, documentations and software (firmwares, utilities, etc...).With that said, the following are instructions on how to setup your IP camera with your LAN/WLAN using a Windows PC. Note that some steps were piggy backed off another reviewer (justChill) and I just did a little bit of refinement based on steps I took to set up my camera.All the things you need are in the box.  The software/driver CD that came with my camera does not work, this is a problem that other users also reported. So, if you're one of the unlucky ones to receive a useless CD, no worries, you can download some of these utilities from the Wansview website as I pointed out on step item IV above. As a matter of fact, you only need 1 utility to do the initial setup and once you connect the camera to your network, the camera itself has a user interface (UI) that includes settings which you can customize, such as e-mail and ftp uploads. The utility can be downloaded from the Wansview site and it's called \"NCB Search_en.rar\"  However, I didn't use this utility because I followed justChill's link and ended up downloading and using a software called \"Search IP Camera\" from the site easyntech.com.  The instructions below refer to the latter software (Search IP Camera).Again, I can't stress enough that you must have at least a basic understanding of router and network terminology and configuration before proceeding; otherwise, STOP here, educate yourself or ask your geek buddy to help you.1) Using the provided ethernet cable, connect your IP camera to your LAN or WLAN router via ethernet port at the back of the router,  and plug in the power supply of the camera, also included.  The camera's LED front light shall light up and the port where the ethernet cable is hooked in should be blinking, indicating your camera has been recognized by your network (LAN/WLAN).2) Now go to your Windows PC (laptop/desktop) and run the software \"Search IP Camera.\"  Alternatively, you can use the one from Wansview but I did not use that so I won't provide instructions on that.3) Search IP Camera has two options for configuration. The Wizard and Advance modes.  The latter takes you directly to the screen where you can change the IP address and port of your camera.  The default IP of your camera can be found on a sticker at the bottom of the camera and it should match the IP that this software detects.  The admin account username and password are also on the sticker.  Regardless which config option you chose, you will need to set the IP of your camera to match the first 3 segments of your subnet and the 4th segment is the number that will make your camera identifiable within your LAN/WLAN.  For example, my WLAN's subnet is 192.168.1.1 up to 192.168.1.255. My camera's default IP is 192.168.0.1 SO I changed this to 192.168.1.3 because 192.168.1.2 is used by my laptop and the 3 is used by my TV.4) After you set up your IP, set your port number.  This is the port that will listen for signals and which relay those signals to the camera's IP. You can chose a number between 1 - 65535. Here's some more information on ports:The Well Known Ports are those from 0 through 1023.The Registered Ports are those from 1024 through 49151.The Dynamic and/or Private Ports are those from 49152 through 65535.Whatever port you chose, this is where your camera will listen for request.5) Now, once you established your IP and port for the camera, click Apply and give the camera a few seconds to acknowledge the new settings.You are done with configuring your camera's IP.  Even if you disconnect your camera from the ethernet or turn the power off, it will retain this address and port.  But if you have a Wireless network (WLAN), also known as Wi-Fi, do not disconnect it or unplug it just yet. You will need to set up the Wireless settings and you can do this using the camera's built-in UI.6) Now for the good stuff: open your internet browser, using the address bar, go to your camera's IP and port. For example, if the IP address you assigned to your cam is 192.168.1.100 and port is 49500, you would type into the address bar the follwoing: 192.168.1.100:49500 and hit Enter or click GO.7) The camera will now ask you for user credentials. Use the user account you found on the sticker at the bottom of the camera. I think the user name is admin and password is 123456Click OK or Enter after you provided the required credentials.8) You should now be in a web page that has a title \"Device(xxxx)\" and presents 3 modes you can use to view the camera and its settings.  I used Mode 2 because it is compatible with any browser (IE, Firefox, Chrome and Safari, even on my iPhone).  For the sake of this instruction, you can't go wrong with Mode 2 so click on it.9) Your camera should now be active and the next page shall display your camera's viewing as well as 5 navigation options at the top: View, Network, Alarm, Advanced, Maintain.a) VIEW- this option allows you to view your camera, rotate it and take snapshots.b) NETWORK- allows you to configure network settings such as changing IP, wireless settings, DDNS and other network-related configurationc) ALARM - this is where you will go to set alarm triggers and specify what you want the camera to do when an alarm occurs (email or ftp pictures, etc...).  This section also allows you to set up a link between your camera and your alarm system, if you have one.d) ADVANCE - this is where you will go to change the camera's default user and also add additional users.  If you plan to access your camera via internet, I suggest you do change your default username and password to something more secured.  In the advance section, you can also configure other cameras if you have additional and also other camera settings, like turning off the LED lights on the unit itself.e)MAINTAIN - this option allows you to reset the camera to factory settings, upgrade firmware and change camera's date/time.You can play around with all these features at your leisure. For now, keep reading IF you want to set up your camera wirelessly (Wi-Fi) and remotely accessible.10) To configure the camera for Wi-Fi or wireless networks, click on the NETWORK link.11) Then on options on the right side, click on Wireless Settings.12) Click on Scan to scan for available wireless networks or if you know your SSID (wireless network name), manually type it in the SSID box.13) Select the encryption method that your WLAN uses (mines is WEP).14) For Authentication, if your encryption method is WEP, you can leave it at Open or chose Shared Key if your router's wireless settings is configured for this.15) Enter your passphrase (network key) on the Key or Shared Key box.16) Click Submit.  The device shall reboot.17) After reboot, you could now set your camera anywhere and you should be able to access it anywhere around your house so long as you're within range of your Wireless Network.The following are steps I took to open my camera for internet access so that I can view it anywhere I go (mobile phone, work, friend's house, etc...).  You will need either a static IP address given to you by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or you can sign up for a DynDNS service (try noip.com --it's free).  I periodically renew my dynamic IP address assigned by my ISP and I don't want to pay for DNS, I chose a 3rd option and may not work for everyone.  The only reason why I chose to do the following is because I have been renewing my IP manually for security reasons and it has worked for me for other remote services I ran at home.  So far it's been working and I'm able to access my cam anywhere.Here's what I did (note that steps and screens will differ for other routers; therefore, since, I don't know what router you have, I will generalized these instructions):A) I went into my router's administration page.  You can do this by typing the IP address of your gateway on your browser's URL/address box.  For example, my gateway IP is 192.168.1.1 which is the router's IP address.B) The router asked for a username and password (this is from step 9d above), I provided them and hit ENTER.  I'm IN.C) Went to Port Forwarding (usually in Advance section) and created a Port Forwarding rule for the camera's IP address (192.168.1.4).  I told the rule to forward all signals from and to port that I assigned to my camera earlier.  Saved the rule.D) Now, I went into the DMZ section where I can tell my router which IP in my LAN I can expose to the internet. I told it to expose the IP of my camera which is 192.168.1.4. If you're not familiar with DMZ, please research.  But for a quick analogy, think of DMZ as the front yard of your house. Anything you put in the front yard is visible to everyone.  Well if you configure your router for DMZ zone and told it to expose the IP of your camera, your camera will be visible via internet; but, though visible, will require you to enter the camera's user credentials when accessing via internet. That's why it is important that on step 9d, you create complex passwords for your camera users to prevent/minimized unauthorized access.E) Now, to test this, get the IP address assigned to you by your ISP, usually found in router basic settings. This is an internet or public IP address.F) Go to a computer that is not part of your network. Perhaps a mobile phone with internet access that does not connect to your wifi.G) Launch an internet browser from that non-networked device. On the address bar of your mobile brower, type in the public IP address of your cam (found on step E) and a colon (:) plus the port number of the camera.  For example:  255.255.255.255:49500 and hit ENTERH) The camera shall now ask you to enter user credentials.  Enter one of the users you configured in step 9d.  VOILA!Again these steps may not work for everyone.Sleepy yet?  We're almost done.  To set up your camera to take pictures and e-mail them to you (there's also an FTP option but I didn't use it because I don't have an FTP server), follow these instructions:Go to ALARMa) Enable \"Motion Detect Armed\"b) Click on \"eMail Settings\" to the rightc) Provide your smtp server address and if authentication is required, provide the username and password.I have an old sbc yahoo e-mail account so I was able to use that to send from and to images that my camera takes when it detects motion. I just checked my e-mail and got about 50 e-mails just from it.  My DOG triggered all of them.  So make sure you adjust the motion sensitivity so that it doesn't react to everything (including light).  The higher the sensitivity the more sensitive.Finally, if you want to access your camera via your mobile devices, there's several apps out there that you can use to do this. Just search for IP Camera.  The one I use is called LiveCams Pro and I bought it for $1.99.Sorry if this was long, I was hoping to give some clear instructions to those that may need it, especially the ones that bashed the item because of poor setup instructions. It is really a BANG FOR YOUR BUCK and worth every penny.Hope this helps somehow...", "Date": "July 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ignore the negative reviews. This offers phenomenal value for the price!", "Author": "Orion \"SM\"", "ReviewID": "R2UD6XU1DUMSAM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am so glad I ignored all the negative reviews slating the camera for being too hard to get working. People really shouldn't be buying wireless devices such as this if they have no idea how to administrate their home networks. While the instructions included aren't great, they aren't nearly as horrible as people make them out to be. I just received my Wansview camera, and I was able to follow each and every step in the included manual and everything worked just perfectly. Granted, I am savvy with administrating my local network, port forwarding, etc, but even without all that work, I was able to get the camera working while wired to my router in no time. Heck, my Brother Wireless printer was a lot harder to get working on my local network...and Brother is a big name, reputable brand!Sometimes I really am amazed at how entitled people can be. This is a $50 product! Good Logitech webcams alone cost more. This does not cost $200+. If it did, you could whine and bitch about the instructions being a little difficult to understand or installation being too complicated. Let's look at what you get for $50:For $50 you get:- A wireless camera- IR (night) imaging capabilities- Pan and tilt (that can be controlled remotely)- Audio capture (remotely)- Ability to have two way communication remotely (need to attach a speaker to the camera)- Access via Web browsers, Android and IOS- Complex functions like Motion detection and corresponding Alarm functions and automated emailing of pictures, or uploading to an FTP server of choice- Free Dynamic DNS forwarding provided by Wansview. This is really useful and makes things a lot easier than having to manually muck around with using a separate dynamic DNS provider.Now, to contrast this, \"Blue Iris\", which is a premium software for administrating Wireless/Network surveillance cameras costs $50 alone. That's just for the software, no cameras included. And Blue Iris doesn't even include any IOS or Android application!I received this product yesterday and it was a breeze to get running. I haven't messed around with advanced features like Motion Detection + Automatic emails yet, but port forwarding and accessing the camera via the internet from my laptop and phone wasn't too difficult. I really like the free Dynamic DNS provided as it makes life easier and additionally, is not blocked by my workplace firewall (most dynamic DNS providers are blocked).A word of advice - Don't bother with the Android/IOS apps. They are very bare bones and not necessary. Once you have the camera set up for remote access, you can use a number of free or $3 apps to access your camera with far better interfaces. I'd highly recommend IP Cam Viewer Pro on both Android and IOS.Get this product if you're interested in the feature set advertised in the product description. It does everything it says it does and is probably the most feature packed product I've ever purchased for 50 bucks. I still can't get over how cheap it is considering all that you can do with it.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Simple to set up and very good for its purpose", "Author": "Bob Walter", "ReviewID": "R1950S599Y23I0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've seen a lot of reviews of this product that suggest it is difficult to set up or fails do work as advertised. I got mine and had none of the problems listed. The camera itself had a different brand name than the one shown in the product listing, but the features and location of connections were exactly as shown.The enclosed (printed) directions are barely understandable. Fear not! Very well written directions are on the enclosed cd. The full user manual has all you may need to know to use the camera in a wide range of applications. If you don't feel like reading them, let me give the you way I set mine up. You do need to do these steps in the exact order I give them if you want the painless install.1. Unpack everything. Find the antenna and screw onto the camera. Be sure you have the network cable and power supply.2. Plug the network cable into the camera and then into your router (wireless router I assume).3. Plug the power cord into the camera and a wall socket. The reason you do this in order is that the camera will sense your network and get an IP address from your router instead of the default that is hard-coded into the camera.4. Load the CD into your PC and install the setup software.5. When you see the menu, select \"Detect the camera\"6. Pick the \"Advanced\" button when the detect screen appears. Do NOT pick the \"Wizard\".7. When the detect window opens, on the top left you see a dropdown with network adapters. You will also see various IP addresses. If you don't see a value for \"Gateway\", go to the dropdown and chances are you will see a 2nd network adapter. The first one is frequently the Microsoft default (on PC's). Select the 2nd adapter. If you see the gateway IP appear, you are in business.8. There is a window on the bottom left that should show your camera. If it isn't there, click the \"Find\" button. If your network connection is correct, it will appear as a line in that window (with the IP address your router assigned it).9. When you click on the camera line, the addresses to the right should appear the same (at least for the camera) as the one on the camera line you selected. Be sure that the gateway address is populated. Write down the camera's IP address. Don't worry you are almost done.10. You will see that there are to web addresses (URL's) on the bottom of the right column. The bottom one is a service to let you see your camera on the web. Set that up at your own peril. The upper one is the address you need to use to access your camera from inside your house. Note it. Also click the button to go to it. A browser will open.11. The browser opens with a bunch of choices. Make the one appropriate for your setup. If you are using Internet Explorer, use the one for IE. Click \"Sign In\".12.

If you have to look up those two acronyms, then you might be disappointed when you buy it, BUT.....Call your nerd friend (you know, the one who is really geeky or talks about Linux or setting up a domain at his/her house) and they can can come over and get it running for you in about 30 minutes.It has a self-explanatory GUI once you are able to address it, and all is configurable over WiFi once configured by wired connection to your particular WiFi setup.I am truly impressed with the quality of the image and the update rate of the images, both daylight and night.  I am actually planning on purchasing and trying the exterior non-PTZ version of this camera to try out their multi-camera interface.All I can say is that I have had this camera for a couple of months now and I couldn't be happier.  BTW, did I mention that it has motion detection alarm features that will FTP or email or both?  Yeah, I know.  It also has a rudimentary scheduler that allows you to only detect alarm conditions during certain periods.  It also has an alarm input, which I haven't had occasion to test yet.If you are someone who complains about things being 'cheap' when you spend significantly less for something than the average price of competition products, then you will probably complain.  If you are someone who is impressed when you spend significantly less for something than the average price of competition products and get some great features and the item just plain works, then you and I would probably enjoy setting up a home network or flying R/C planes!", "Date": "May 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beware of \"Spying\"?", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R13YGZRJXDP2C1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've bought two of these and they're easy to set-up and use.

If you're on a tight deadline or want something that just works without some tinkering, you should probably look elsewhere and plan to pay double (or triple) the price of this guy.That having been said, my camera is now working great. It's $200 worth of functionality for $50 plus the time to figure it out.HELPFUL TIPS FOR THOSE BRAVE SOULS WHO WANT TO SAVE THE MONEY BUT DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING(you're my people)Below are the problems I encountered and how I surmounted them.Problem #1: Wifi will not work; router can only see camera when it is plugged into an Ethernet portSolution that worked for me: Firmware updateDetails:1) Go to Wanview's website (I'd post the URL, but Amazon will delete it)2) Click the \"Download Firmware\" link beside the entry \"Series B Pan Tilt Camera\"3) Once the ZIP file has been downloaded, unzip it (it contains a single BIN file)4) With the camera connected via Ethernet cable, point your browser at the camera's IP address5) Click the \"Maintain\" tab at the top6) Click the \"Upgrade Firmware\" button on the right7) Beside \"Upgrade Firmware\" browse to your BIN file and click submit.I may have had to reboot or cycle power after the update and unplugging the ethernet cable.Problem #2: Included software has very limited functionalitySolution that worked for me: Use iSpy insteadDetails:1) Go to CNET downloads website and search for \"iSpy\" (I'd post the URL, but Amazon will delete it)2) Download \"iSpy_4_2_6_0.zip\"3) Once the ZIP file has been downloaded, unzip it (it contains 2 files)4) Launch \"iSpySetup.msi\"5) Also need the VLC plugin: Go to VideoLAN's website6) Download VLCProblem #2B: iSpy's configuration wizard does not know this cameraSolution: (from a most helpful fellow at the iSpy connnect forum)I just figured out how to add my new Wansview NCB 541W to iSpy. All I did was to catch the Commands via SmartSniff an add them manually to the ptz.xml file.[here is the vitally important magic.]The Videostream for the VLC Plugin is:h t t p : / / [USER] : [PW] @ [URL] / videostream.asfType the above into iSpy's video stream VLC URL field.  Here's how to get to it:[your camera] > rt-click > Edit > \"Camera\" tab > click \"...\" button beside \"Source\"A \"Video Source\" dialog should popup.Click on the \"VLC Plugin\" tab (this is why you needed that plugin above)and enter the above URL into the VLC URL field.[I think this next bit is optional but helpful]I added an extra Item to my ptz.xml file with the commands as follows:<Camera Make=\"WansView\" Version=\"NCB 541W\" id=\"26\"><CommandURL>/decoder_control.cgi</CommandURL><Commands><Center>command=25</Center><Left>command=6</Left><LeftUp>command=93</LeftUp><Right>command=4</Right><RightUp>command=92</RightUp><Up>command=2</Up><Down>command=0</Down><LeftDown>command=91</LeftDown><RightDown>command=90</RightDown><Stop>command=1</Stop><ZoomIn></ZoomIn><ZoomOut></ZoomOut><ExtendedCommands><Command Name=\"Stop\">command=1</Command><Command Name=\"Horizon patrol\">command=28</Command><Command Name=\"Stop horizon patrol\">command=29</Command><Command Name=\"Vertical patrol\">command=26</Command><Command Name=\"Stop vertical patrol\">command=27</Command></ExtendedCommands></Commands></Camera>Edit: You might have to adjust the \"id\" attribute in the first line according to the place this camera will take in the file.Problem #3: Email on motion not working (test failed)Solution that worked for me: Use Gmail's SMTPDetails:On the Wansview web interface, Go to \"Alarm\" > \"eMail Settings\"Outgoing Mail (SMTP) Server - requires TLS3 or SSL: smtp.gmail.com (use authentication)Use Authentication: YesPort for TLS/STARTTLS: 587Port for SSL: 465Account Name: your full email address (including@gmail.com or @your_domain.com)Email Address: your email address (username@gmail.comor username@your_domain.com)Password: your Gmail passwordSource: [...]NOTE: I have not addressed port forwarding, because I didn't need it.Hope this helps,Ken", "Date": "June 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Better than I expected at this price point", "Author": "Jerome F.

(Remember to go to the wireless settings and connect to your router and enter any WEP or WPA security codes needed).  Then you can unplug the network cable.If you want to view over the internet you MUST add a \"port forwarding\" entry into your router for the port you set up during initial setup.

The IP camera that I ordered is Wansview branded and I can find their website is wansview.com so I think the one I ordered is still a brand made in China.  I had bad experience with other seller that the merchandise was poorly packaged and not manufacturer's original package, so I had to return it immediately without having a chance to use it.This Wansview NCB-541W that I ordered is in a manufacturer's package and I spent a couple of days to get it work.  Looking at other reviews with low ratings due to frustrating setups, I can totally understand.  Here I want to share some of my experience with using this camera.First, I connected the IP camera to my home network in wired mode (ethernet cable connected to your router).  Follow the instruction manual, running the search in the CD within the package, it was able to find my IP camera's default IP address.  But make sure the first three numbers of the IP address should be the same as the PC used for setup so that they can be on the same network.  When I did the search, my PC's IP address is 192.168.1.xxx, but the searching function in the installation CD still shows the IP camera's address as 192.168.0.yyy, so I had to change the third number to 1.  Make sure the fourth number yyy is a different number than any other devices in the home network.  I also setup an identical HTTP port for my camera.  After entering the default admin account name and password I saved the initial setting.  To view the IP camera using the DDNS that the manufacturer provided on a label the bottom of the camera, I had to login to my router's management interface for \"Virtual Server\" setup.  I added a HTTP virtual server with my IP camera's IP address as the LAN Server, TCP as protocol, and port as the one I setup for my IP camera.  Now I could view the IP camera \"wiredly\" from anywhere within my home network using the DDNS address.To connect the IP camera wirelessly, I went to my IP camera's setup interface which as View, Network, Alarm, Advanced, Maintain tabs under Wansview title, click Network on the top, and then Wireless Settings on the right, then check \"Using Wireless Lan\" and type in my wireless LAN's SSID, Encryption, and secure key.  Then I disconnected the ethernet cable between the router and the camera.  Now I could move my camera anywhere in the house and it becomes wireless.  I can view it from the PC using wireless LAN.  But make sure your SSID is broadcast, if it is hidden, the camera will not be able to find it.To be able to view the camera from outside of my home network, I had to go to Remote Management of my router's setup interface to enable UPnP.  Also I had to go to my IP camera's setup interface which as View, Network, Alarm, Advanced, Maintain tabs under Wansview title, click Network tab and then click UPnP Settings menu on the right and then check Using UPnP to map port and then click Submit button to save the change.  Then I could view the camera remotely from a public WIFI network.To setup the IP camera to be able to send alarm email, I had to go to the camera setup interface, and click Alarm tab, check Motion detection Armed and Send Mail on Alarm, and then go to the email settings page, to setup my Gmail SMTP server, port, TLS protocol, user, and password, sender and receiver.  Make sure user should be entire email address.  Google the internet, you should be able to find the server and port setting for all Gmail, hotmail and Yahoo mail.  A tricky thing was I also had to go to my router's setting interface for \"Virtual Server\" setup, and add a SMTP virtual server with my camera's IP address as LAN server, port as the one that my Gmail SMTP server uses and enable the virtual server, then I was able to send an email.  Then I waled in front of my camera and wave my hand.  Then I got the email with four pictures showing myself.  So motion detection works!  But when I did this at night, the camera didn't capture my moving.  Maybe the sensitivity setting of motion detection is not sensitive enough.  I have to do more adjustment.But so far I am very satisfied with this Wansview camera.  I can remotely control the lens moving horizontally for 270 degrees and at least 90 degrees vertically.

I believe any outdoor mounting location will work as long as you keep the camera protected from ANY kind of moisture or rain. I'm not sure if I'll keep it outside in the winter however, as the extreme cold will probably kill it.Set up is not difficult if: 1) You understand intermediate-level networking concepts, and 2) You actually READ the manual! Although the manual is rather poorly translated, it's not so bad that you can't follow it. All the setup issues you will encounter are covered in the manual. Patience is a must. That said, it performs as described with decent (although not great) video performance. After all, we're talking about a $50 camera here. The remote access feature (from anywhere on the Internet) is nice. The built-in web interface works well (no need to install any software to gain access to the camera). All-in-all, a terrific value for the features it has.TIP: Download iSpy (open source software from sourceforge.net) for MUCH better control of the camera.

I purchased and received three of them and the quality and features are astonishing. The cameras pan, tilt, zoom and rotate with the click of the mouse and can be viewed and controlled over Local LAN and by internet access.The set up was fairly simple, although it took me 45 minutes to an hour to read over the manual (included on the CD) and the quick installation guide and to finally set the first camera up. I was up and running by LAN and wireless with all three cameras in less than two hours.For the set up:Read over the manual and quick installation guide prior to attempt the set up or else you might get discourage/lost. Once you get an overview and a baseline for the set up:1. Connect an Ethernet cable from your router straight to the camera, plug the power cord to the camera and lunch the camera finder application (program is on the CD provided), from there you can adjust the settings to match those of your own LAN. The wireless set up must be done within the web interface of the camera (see below)2. A different way to achieve the same can be done by accessing the Web Interface of the camera by lunching a browser and pointing it to the internal camera IP Address (the default IP Address for the cameras is on a sticker on the camera itself and also on the the quick installation guide) - once the browser connects to the camera it will ask for user name (admin) and password (123456), from there you may make changes to the camera as far as; IP Address, Gateway, DNS, Subnet, Port, Wireless Access (you'd need to have your WAP Key available), you can change password, set up DNS services, FTP, Alarms, emails, etc, etc3. Ensure all the new changes match your own LAN set up and remember the IP Addresses you gave each camera (Turn of DHCP on the cameras web interface to ensure cameras always get the same IP address from your router)as well as the port assigned to each (you'd need that to gain access to the cameras by LAN or WAN/Internet).4. Also, ensure your router is set for Wireless G and not N (cameras only work with G), if you happen to have MAC Filter on the router, disable it for the set up (you may enable it after the set up) or else your cameras will not have access to an IP address from the router.5. Go to the router Port Forwarding section and ensure the ports assigned to each camera and the IP Addresses assigned to each match your inputs on the port forwarding section (without port forwarding set up correctly, cameras can't be viewed outside the LAN and over the internet)6. Go and find a computer outside your LAN and test the internet viewing access; input your ISP provided IP Address (get that from your router administration page or just Google \"what is my ip\") follow by the port (port forwarding must be set up within your router for this to work properly - read below) assigned to the cameras. For instance, if your ISP provided IP is \"123.45.67.89\" and the port you assigned to the camera is \"1510\", then input the following on the browser: \"[...]\", if everything is set up correctly you'd get a pop up asking for username and password. Enter the info requested and bang, you are now watching your premises from the distance and over the internet.7. I must advise that the installation, although not difficult can be a challenge if there isn't any \"basic\" networking skills available. Read the manual, read, the manual, read the manual and the quick installation guide over and over and prior to start the set up or making any changes to the default values.EDIT: For those folks that don't know how to turn off the \"green idiot light,\" please; lunch the cameras web interface and navigate to the \"Advance Tab\" from there the light may be turn on or off.EDIT: The Advanced Tab is viewable once you are logged in the Cameras Web Interface (type the IP of the camera, enter user name and password and you should see it) once you see the tab, click on \"other settings\" - the choice to turn the light on or off is the first selection given.I use FF as browser, but am sure is the same for IE.UPDATE: FYI, two out of three of the cameras purchased were installed outside of my premises (backyard and front yard), up to date, they have performed flawlessly. I have found a cheap solution to shield them from the weather elements (go to the dollar store and buy the cheapest plastic \"dust pan\" you can find; cut off the handle and use it as \"top cover\" for the cameras installed outside. I used screws to install the dust pans (installed outside down/flipped) so they would serve as cover and protect the cameras from rain, sun, snow, etc.Cheap and reliable (so far) way to protect your cameras.Good luck and enjoy the product!", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly Sophisticated", "Author": "Dodge DeBoulet", "ReviewID": "R1XVP23BKTMO2H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This wireless IP Cam offers a tremendous number of features for a very reasonable price. Not only does it provide pan/tilt support and very good night-time video quality, it includes both a microphone and built-in speaker for two-way audio communication. The speaker isn't particularly loud, but an audio jack for an external (powered) speaker setup is also present.It's very easy to configure for remote viewing, assuming the router/firewall it is installed behind supports uPnP. The URL needed to reach the camera remotely appears on a sticker on the bottom; you need only add a colon (\":\") followed by the port number to which you've set the camera to listen on. It also works quite well with GMail's SMTP services for mail delivery; something other IP cameras don't do.Two things that underwhelm me, though: 1) You cannot turn the IR LED illumination off, preventing you from using this camera through a window at night (IR glare reflected from the glass). 2) The included software is minimally functional for actual surveillance use.

If your router's domain doesn't match the preset IP in the Wansview, then you need to take an extra series of steps to ...first reset your router's domain address so you can find the IP Cam and change the preset IP back to your original domain setting... the static IP address cannot be change any other way.  Therefore, due to the setup difficulty and 50% failure rate (bias that is...lol), I vote \"non-rec\" for the Wansview brand.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price!", "Author": "JamesMW", "ReviewID": "R2N1UCO4L5RWBQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great cam for the price.

The panning motor is nearly silent, and the \"on\" lamp can be turned off remotely with the camera still on.  There is no charge to access the video stream remotely.

Since I had to run power to the owl box to power the camera anyway, I am using the camera in wired mode with Ethernet cable rather than wirelessly, so I have no experience trying to get the camera working wirelessly. It is not set up for power over Ethernet, so I am running two light gauge insulated wires carrying 120 VAC outside a shielded outdoor rated Ethernet cable and a 14 gauge galvanized steel wire (to add strength) all overhead and bundled together between the second floor deck of my house and the twenty foot high owl box, which is hanging from a tree limb.The documentation is skimpy and obviously written by a person for whom English is a second language. I am an intermediate level networking end user and not a networking professional. I sent one email to tech support with a question that was competently answered by email within 24 hours. I was able to get the camera to serve the intended purpose, which includes logging detection of motion within the owl box and day and night real time viewing of the owl box interior. The pan/tilt feature is nice for remotely aiming the camera. The software facilitates printing nice pictures of what I see when viewing.No barn owls have taken up residence in my owl box yet, but it may not be the right time of year for that. I am wondering if the night vision infra red lights will scare away owls who might otherwise take up residence, so I have decided to power off the unit at the house end of the cable bundle for a few weeks at a time, powering it up from time to time to check occupancy.

However, there do seem to be some bugs and quality control issues that are likely to frustrate people who aren't comfortable troubleshooting network or hardware issues.I'm using these as monitors to keep track of the kids when I'm in a different part of our house.  My youngest is autistic and tends to get into lots of mischief, so these have come in very handy.  They've already allowed me to intervene on several potentially dangerous or messy situations that I would have otherwise missed until it was too late.-----------1st Camera-----------The first camera I ordered worked almost flawlessly and was easy to setup.  After plugging it into my network over ethernet and powering up, it was immediately accessible at 192.168.0.178 (port 80) and I had no problems changing the default IP and port to something else using their search utility tool.  After logging in through the browser interface, I changed the admin login and was able to input the settings for my wireless network and the camera still functioned well after rebooting in wifi only mode.The picture looked great, the PTZ controls worked well and I had no problems accessing it from a remote location once port forwarding was setup on my router.  I briefly activated the motion detection & email alert feature and was able to confirm it works.  The only real negative was that audio on the camera sounded terrible and had a lot of interference...but I didn't need audio support, so this didn't bother me.I was so impressed by the overall price and quality that I immediately ordered two more cameras.-----------2nd Camera-----------The second camera worked and setup just as easily as the first one.  I set it to a different IP, gave it a unique port for remote access and had no issues connecting it to the second wireless network in my house.  Like the first camera, audio sounds terrible (over a wired and wireless connection).-----------3rd Camera-----------The third camera worked fine over a wired connection, but not wifi.  It would see the available wireless networks in my house and allow me to input & save the settings for one of them....but as soon as I unplugged ethernet and rebooted the camera...I could no longer access the camera or see it using their search utility.  I tried multiple IP addresses and ports, but nothing worked.  After a couple of hours of troubleshooting, it stopped listing available wireless networks entirely and the wifi functionality seemed completely dead.Since that camera still worked over ethernet and was being placed in a room with a network switch, I decided just keep it and use it over a wired connection. In fact, I plan to switch the other two cameras to wired connections as well because I've noticed speed/performance drops on other wifi-only devices in our house since setting these cameras up.  I assume it is because the cameras in wifi mode are taking up a lot of bandwidth.Audio on the 3rd camera is equally bad as the first two.------------Connectivity------------After a few days of use, the two that are in wifi-only mode have had to be rebooted a couple of times because they periodically drop off the network and don't show up using the search utility.  Other wifi devices in the house still work when this happens, so I don't think it's a problem with my wireless network.  The camera that is connected over ethernet hasn't had a problem, nor has it needed to be rebooted since mounting it.---------------Buggy Behavior---------------Last night, the first camera froze up completely while viewing it from the tinyCam app on my android tablet and rebooting didn't fix the problem.  I connected it over ethernet and, although the camera showed up using their search utility, it would no longer accept the administrative login.I ended up doing a factory reset using the button located at the bottom of the camera, but it still wouldn't accept the factory login (admin/123456).  Eventually I noticed that the 'DeviceName' was blank for the camera and it no longer defaulted to 192.168.0.178, which seemed to indicate that the factory setting were somehow wiped out.  I tried logging in with just the default username (admin) but left the password field blank.  This worked and I was able to login and change the settings back to how I originally had them.  It's been working fine since.Unfortunately, I cannot be sure if the connection/performance problems I'm having are with the cameras or the software I've been using to view them.  It seems the only time they have frozen up is when I'm using software that supports the audio & recording capabilities (Internet Explorer, IPCMonitor, 3rd party surveillance software, etc).  I haven't had any problems using the browser based interface with Chrome or Firefox (which don't support recording or audio).  I also haven't had a problem using IP Camera Viewer 1.1 (which is a freeware utility to view multiple IP cams, but it also lacks support for the audio or recording capabilities of this camera).---------------Summary---------------Despite the problems I've had above...I'm still happy with these cameras because they were inexpensive and haven't been difficult for me to troubleshoot when there have been problems.  This is my first experience using an ip cam, so I have nothing to compare it against in terms of connection reliability or ease of setup.I don't think you need to be a networking guru to set these up, but you'll need to understand the basics of home networking and how IP addresses are used/allocated within your local area network (LAN).  You'll also need to be familiar with port forwarding on your router if you wish to view your camera(s) remotely.  These concepts may seem daunting at first to a novice user, but they're easy to learn about with a couple of google searches.PROS:- Very clear picture quality- PTZ controls work well- Camera mount included- Ability to flip/mirror camera view for ceiling mounted cameras- Motion detection with email/audio/ftp/msn alerts.- Ability to add multiple login accounts with different levels of access (Admin, operator or visitor)- Compatible with iPhone/Android cam viewers- PriceCONS:- Poor/Unusable audio- Questionable reliability over wifi- Off brand that may lack profile support with 3rd party surveillance software==============================UPDATE: 03/14/20123==============================------------4th Camera------------The fourth camera arrived and it was branded as 'EasyN' instead of a 'Wansview'.  Aside from the logo on the camera & slightly different style mount, the camera itself looks the same.  However, the browser-based viewing interface & settings area look completely different (though essentially provide the same functions).The EasyN cam seems a little slower to repond to PTZ commands and night vision is definitely less clear than the Wansview cams (day time viewing still looks good).  It also boots into patrol mode and is unresponsive until it finishes a couple of circuits.  I've searched for a way to disable this behavior, but haven't found anything yet.  Like the Wansview Cameras, audio is still pretty poor and has a lot of static/interferance.On the other hand, unlike the three previous Wansview cameras I reviewed...I am able to use the 'TALK' feature that allows the camera to function as an intercom, which is pretty darn neat.  There are audio ports on all of these cameras, and I had previously assumed that I needed an external speaker connected to the unit to utilize that feature.  So either the EasyN view has an internal speaker that the Wansview brand lacks....or this feature is disabled or nonfunctioning in the Wansview cameras.Another thing to note is that the EasyN camera arrived in much better packaging than that of the Wansview version.  All parts were securely encased in molded foam padding and the box was printed with the brand/model.  The wansview cameras arrived in all-white boxes that used molded cardboard as padding.Overall, I still prefer the UI & performance of the Wansview cameras...but the Talk/Intercom functionality (without an external speaker) on the EasyN is really nice.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera and amazing price", "Author": "W.

So I started googleing again and found a program called \"I SPY\".  The program works on hundreds of IP cameras and is available for Windows 32 or 64 bit and also for MAC users.  The program is open source, meaning you don't have to buy it.  It is free of charge and no bloatware and no advertisements.  If you are interested in this program, just google \"I SPY SOURCEFORGE\" without the quote marks.  Look for \"iSpy Camera Security Software | Free Graphics software ...\" in the search results.  Download the program and install - follow the setup screens and you're in business.If you try and like the program the author of this program would like a donationOverall I am very satisfied with this product, however I think the manufacture of this product needs to improve their software CD and quick install guide or better yet quit shipping the CD and lower the price.Good Luck with your install and happy webcaming --- True Texan", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "awesome", "Author": "Ian", "ReviewID": "R2S2IC4K6TYJ8T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Don't pay attention to the nay sayers.

Long story short, we have meth heads who live next door and make a living out of stealing other people's stuff. Thankfully, they are in jail now. But before they went to jail we were worried about our stuff unattended when we went to visit family over the holidays. So we were planning on paying over a thousand dollars to have a security system with DVR set up in our 2 bedroom apartment. I am so thankful I chose this route! The reason for the fight was my boyfriend had checked the reviews for these cameras and there are a lot of negative ones. But I told him I'd rather spend this little bit of money to try this camera than pay a ton or be unprotected. The people who left bad reviews of this product either got duds (I got one as well and sent it back for free) or are complete idiots and did not set them up correctly. I had no prior knowledge of networks, etc. before setting up these cameras but setup was still a breeze (with justchill's instructions). I learned a little bit about that kind of stuff during setup too, which is another plus.Basically I wanted to leave this review to tell you, like many others have, what a great value these cameras are! $100 for 2 cameras got us the security we needed during our outings over the holidays. We can log in from our phone (we use IPCam Viewer Free Droid App) or any computer to see, move, turn motion on/off the cameras, etc. We have set the motion alarm to send an email that hits our phones, which is awesome! Now not only are we protected from the neighbors, but we can see when our dog gets up while we are gone. We get an email every time she moves with 6 pictures on it.Needless to say, I still have to tell my boyfriend \"I told you so\" every once and a while.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrific Camera", "Author": "Larry E.

I would add that changing the IP port to accommodate DNS pass-thru so that the camera can be used and manipulated remotely is not very difficult, but one must be aware of a few basic potential and somewhat immediately recognizable pitfalls.1. Set the IP address first so that the camera can be accessed on the network, saving the changes to the camera.  Again, use the hard wire connection first to set the IP, let it reboot, then you can set up the wireless connection while still hard-wire connected if that's what you wish to use.  If your home network router/gateway is the typical 192.168.1.1, set the camera for a static IP address based on whatever rules you may have set up for DHCP.  For example, you may set up your router to assign IP addresses from .100 thru .254, leaving from .2 to .99 available for static (manual) IP assignments.  Assign your camera IP address to fall in the static IP range.  In the example, maybe use 192.168.1.61 as the camera's IP.2.  After saving the camera's IP address it will reboot as others have noted.  Go back in to the network setup and assign a port different from 80.  Standards exist where emails and Internet access in general use ports 25 and 80.  Port 8080 also has a standard use.  Almost every other port is subject to assignment by users for specific functions.  You may choose say Port 81 for the IP camera's port.  Note that when you select save settings the camera will once again reboot but this time you will not be able to access the camera in the same windows screen.  In order to view the camera locally, you must enter the camera's IP address followed by a colon then the port number.  For example, if you assigned IP address .61 for the camera and use port 81, the new url for the camera would be 192.168.1.61:81.  BAM - you're connected.  I believe someone else mentioned that there needs to be a unique port for each IP address to be remotely accessed.  You might consider assigning the IP address to be the same as the port number for ease of reference...  Or use your own logic and method...3.  As clearly written by others, in order for a dns server to enable access to the camera, you must set up the router to pass your new camera's port assignment through from the firewalled (home) side to the provider (Internet) side and also identify the IP address of the device that has been assigned to the port.  Hence the requirement for assigning a static IP address to the camera.4.  I used no-ip.com in order to purchase a domain name, which I plan to develop for a few other purposes, but I ran into trouble with my four-year-old Linksys router.  It does not support no-ip.com as a DNS provider.  I may upgrade or try to find a work-around, but you might want to verify that your router can support the DNS entry if you use your own.  Otherwise, the DNS site on the bottom of the camera enabled entry for remote access to my Android right away thru my cellular providers' network.  Maybe others know of a work-around?Now to play and get a few more of these running and getting software up to set up my own little security network.  I can't speak for long term quality, as I've only had this up and running a few weeks, but for specific applications, it should work just fine.  Keep in mind pro cameras are up around $2k, so you're not going to get 100 yards of night vision and HD quality...I didn't find the software that came on the cd very useful, but again, remember what you're paying.  If the software had a few more features (and actually let me see the camera quickly), the rating would have been five stars.  At least let the software control the camera and provide a view screen that works as opposed to having to use the web browser interface.  Over the next few months I'll likely purchase Blue Iris or some other similar program and take this to the next level.

As others have stated, it is not as turnkey of a setup process as plugging in a mouse or keyboard to your computer.  You're going to have to roll up your sleeves and do a little work under the hood with the camera and probably your home router/gateway.  However, it's clear to me that the manufacturer is listening to feedback because there were tools bundled on the installation CD that auto detected the camera for both Mac and PC systems.  They also bundled other thoughtful programs such as smartphone apps for iPhone and Android.  That said, I have an Android and was happier with some of the third party options (I like TinyCam Monitor [...]).Once you get it set up, which I would say is a 'medium' level of difficulty (don't buy this as a Christmas gift for your Grandma and mail it to her to figure it out), the camera is VERY feature rich for the price.  The camera has an onboard server/camera control system that allows you to move the camera (up/down, left/right), adjust contrast/brightness, set motion alarms, configure email/ftp photo notifications, listen to audio, talk through the camera, and more.  These functions also work through third party apps like the one I mentioned above.Picture quality is excellent both in daytime and nighttime (IR) modes and both the resolution and framerate can be adjusted to balance quality with the bandwidth available in your network.This camera is an excellent value for the price and I would highly recommend it as long as you're comfortable with a little bit of set up.

It took me a while to get it functioning (the directions are kind of cryptical) but is now works wirelessly in the playhouse and serves as a great child monitor.  There is a growling on the audio but I can still hear what the kids are saying.  I hooked up a speaker to it and now they can hear me talking from my laptop.  My wireless internet is kind of slow, so sometimes the audio does not work too great, and there is about a 2 second delay on the video, which is no big deal.My kids (now only 4 and 7) think the camera is great, and looks like R2D2.  I'm sure their opinion will change if the camera lasts a few more years!The night vision is impressive.  We have trained the kids to turn the camera on with a powerstrip when they enter the playhouse, and turn it off when they leave, otherwise the camera is on all of the time and the red led's are on all night, and I am hoping they will last longer if we only have the camera on when we need it.The pan and tilt is very wide-ranging - we can look out the playhouse window back at our house, and scan the back yard also.  I had to mount the camera in the window of the playhouse to get adequate wireless communication with the camera.

Plug it into my network and power and run the search app on the CD they sent. It found the camera. I hit the \"SUBMIT\" button to lock in the settings, it rebooted and then I was able to click on BROWSE and it opened up the web interface. At that point I turned on the Wireless and set that up, did another reboot and unplugged my network cable, within a minute it was up and running.I did have some issues with the email alert settings but after a few minutes I got it. Basically you enter all your settings and there is a \"TEST\" button. Don't push test UNTIL you hit \"SUBMIT\"! It turns out your not testing what you entered, you are testing what you submitted. So since you may not have submitted anything yet it fails, fast. Press submit after entering the settings and then test and it works.What I did is I set this up to email me to a new google email address I setup for this camera, I also put in it to email my private picasa web album email address so not only do I get emails, but it also puts those pictures in my new accounts camera album in picasa.The picture quality, sure its not HD but within a few seconds of stepping in front of the camera I get an email with 5 pictures and the pictures are uploaded to picasa.works well for the price. I was very surprised at how quiet the camera is when controlling it. I had one of these before (different brand) and you could hear the motor kick on, this thing you can pan and tilt silently.

Pickering", "ReviewID": "RAG4DA7O0ZGTQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to use as a baby cam for the new baby we're expecting.  A lot of units marketed as dedicated baby cameras are either under-featured IP cams or glorified audio monitors with a rinky-dink LCD screen for viewing.  In both cases, the cameras were more expensive than they needed to be and lacking in features like night vision and remote control.  I thought I would take a chance on this camera to see if it would work for my needs.For what is essentially a cheap Chinese product, the camera and its accessories came attractively packaged with a lot of little extras (Cat5, mounting bracket, etc).  The instructions were easy enough to follow, and the software works well enough.I think it bears mentioning at this point that the term \"cheap Chinese\" reflects only cost and country of origin.  What a lot of people think is that the product is lousy or underfeatured, but that's not the case.  I've stated in a lot of my other reviews that I've had fantastic luck with cheap Chinese electronics, and the only consistent problem I've ever had with them is poor translations in the manuals.  The products in general work great, if you tinker with them a bit.Back to the camera - the unit is bulky (about the size of a grapefruit), but it works really well.  The camera has a really great range of motion in its tilt/pan, and the night vision is surprisingly clear, thanks to the ring of infrared LED's surrounding the lens.  The status LED shines bright green under the lens, but that's a feature you can turn off in the web interface.This camera operates much like a router in the respect that you can log into it via IP address and manage it with an internet browser.  This is handy, because no software is required to control, alter, or view the camera.  Viewing resolution maxes out at 640x480, which is big and clear enough to provide an adequate amount of detail.This camera does have a few hang-ups, though.  Firstly, to get the most out of this camera, you have to use Internet Explorer.  The camera works well enough with Chrome or Firefox, but things like audio, multiple camera mode, and recording require a plug-in for Internet Explorer.  This is really unfortunate for those who want to use an alternative browser.In addition to that, the camera only offers a few DDNS options.  For those who don't know, DDNS is Dynamic Domain Name Service, which is what allows you to control devices on your network when you're not local.  Specifically, if you have internet service that does not assign a static IP address to your modem, you need DDNS to point to your network even when your IP changes.  Anyway, DynDNS is the first and most prominent option with this camera, but recently DynDNS stopped providing free DDNS services, so you'll have to pony up some cash for that.  Otherwise, you can pick from a few offshore DDNS providers, some of which I found only in Chinese, so I was a little reluctant about that.One last thing I'd like to mention about this camera that hung up the setup process for me a little is that the camera must be managed by logging into its default IP address, which is 192.168.0.178.  That's not really much of a problem, but if your router's DHCP range is something like 192.168.1.2-254 or something like that, the camera will be constantly searching for a network because the fixed IP is outside the DHCP range.  The work-around is to plug the cat5 straight from the camera to your computer and browse to the device, where you can change its default address, set it to obtain its IP automatically, or assign its MAC address a dedicated IP in your router's settings.  However, this problem is only an issue on certain networks, and if your network is set to dole out IP addresses that the camera has set up by default.Like a lot of network devices, this camera is highly configurable and may take some tinkering to get it to work with your setup, but I think it's a great purchase that will be useful for a long time after the baby doesn't require constant monitoring.  Since these cameras can accommodate multiple devices on the same network with a grid-view, this would be a good choice to set up a piecemeal security setup on an existing network.If you can live with the little hang-ups this camera has, you'll find that it's extremely useful and versatile.", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Locks up computer!!", "Author": "bork", "ReviewID": "R2BB5ELDHOXNWY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Camera works.

The set-up was much easier than the last camera I had; Tenvis JPT3815W, which I returned because it was just too difficult to connect the Wifi and poor instructions and customer support.  I had this camera running in about an hour. It would have been like 20 minutes but I missed something while setting up the WiFi connection. Downloading the applications from the cd was very easy as was connecting to the camera by cable and Wifi. I downloaded the recommended IOS app for my Iphone, Bi Smarteye. I quickly realized that the app left a lot to be desired. The display could only be viewed vertically, could not be made bigger and was half the screen, which is too small for it to be useful and it has no sound available. I searched a little and settled with Ip Cam Viewer Lite by NibblesnBits. The set-up was easier and much more user friendly and does have audio (cam to phone only- Camera speaker use requires upgrade to Pro). The IR and color view are good and the camera responds well to commands.Note on the set-up: I used a Linksys router with a static IP. The camera has two options to use for IP address and port forwarding with the router. You can manually set it or click a box to automatically assign an IP address. I chose the auto option but it assigned a number higher than one supported by the router. Which I found out after trial and error. But I was able to give it my own IP address and port. This worked quick with the cable attached but I had a difficult time with the Wifi connection. I knew the camera was receiving a signal because of the green light indicator on the camera. After a lot of tinkering around with ports and IP addresses I finally realized that the very last line on the PDF instructions stated that the router gateway and DNS have to match the camera's. This is done from the first screen, which is the same screen that asks how you want to connect, auto or manually. On the page it shows the router info on the left and the camera info on the right. I did not realize that when I switched from Auto to manual connection that the gateway and DNS were no longer the same. A very simple fix only after I realized what the heck was going on.

The only potential stumbling block was to remember that once you have it working while connected with the network cable, you still need to select the wireless interface. I did not set mine up for internet viewing, only local viewing. In my situation Internet viewing was not needed.The web browser application works well for video, and the camera is easy to control. I found no way at all to get sound to work over the browser interface.If you install the IPC-Monitor software that was included on the CD I received, you are able to access sound. However, for whatever reason, there is an extremely heavy buzzing background on the audio (not present in the room where the device sits), and the actual audio transmitted over the camera mic is very soft. In addition the IPC-Monitor software I received requires you to enter the PC administrator (not the camera admin) password every time you run it. This is ridiculous and an obvious security risk. I bought the \"IP Cam Viewer Pro\" application for my Android phone and tablet. That works well, and makes it a bit more convenient to view than using the browser.

Setup is reasonable and if you have a bit of networking knowledge actually pretty easy. The best review is the one Titled: Can't complain for all the features it has at its price!A couple of things he left out.The review mentions that the disk that came with the camera was blank. Just go to the website listed on the box and you can download everything you need. Note that don't do a good search because some of the first sites that hit for wansview are not the site with the firmware and software. Use the URL on the box.While you're setting up your camera, you'll be able to view it on your local network. With very few exceptions, even once you get it set up you won't be able to use your ISP issued IP to view the camera on your own network. This is because most (almost all) routers do not support reverse NAT  (there is no way for your computer to pretend that it is trying to access your network from the internet side of the router). When you get the forwarding setup just call a friend or go to a local wifi hotspot to make sure you can access it from the internet.I would also recommend that you set up your camera with a fixed IP address. This will make port forwarding and everything much easier. In your routers setup, see what the DHCP address range is for your lan. It will typically be something like 50 - 150. So your router will issue IP addresses starting at 50 and go up to 150. Set your camera IP address below the range you see. In this case I would set it at 45 so in the camera software you'd put 192.168.##.45 (make sure you match the first three setting with your lan settings).Then follow the directions for port forwarding and have your router forward the port you selected to the fixed ip you selected.One other great feature is that it included a DDNS service. Basically, the camera checks in with their servers and updates the IP that your ISP assigns you.  When you looking at your camera from outside of your network you can just type in yourcameraid.nwsvr.com and it will translate that to your IP and port forwarding setup.Also in the email settings tab, your camera can be set to send you updates whenever the ISP changes the IP which is a great service.All in all, a great camera for the price.

You can preset 15 locations where it points to then select each position from a web page or phone. You can also control the movements on the webpage.

If this matters to you and you want to shell out an additional $14-15, go ahead and get the Loftek, otherwise read on. My background is in PCs and networking with around (!) 25+ years of experience, so quite familiar with WIFI Access point and routers in addition to PC, MAC, and Linux. For this review, I just used my Windows XP laptop.Get an NTP servers DNS name (the Wansview has a default for US customers, but the NIST recommendation is to change it to a regional entry). This ensures the all timestamps are accurate.IF you intend to send email messages when the camera alarms, then you will need the Yahoo, Gmail, other SMPT servers outgoing SMTP address (Yahoo example: Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP) - smtp.mail.yahoo.com (port 25). Different ports and settings for Yahoo Plus and Gmail!!Save the settings and then use the Test button (nice!) to test if you can send outbound email. Note that the camera sends the MAC address with the SMTP (email) messages, this can be changed during configuration.IF you want to send images to an FTP server or Alarm server, you will need the information to connect to those as well, including username, password and the right syntax to connect to the FTP server. In my setup I will send images off-site to an FTP server to save them in case the bad guys break into my place. At least I will have nice mug shots for the cops.Decide if you want to use a DHCP provided address from your WIFI AP or you want to assign a fixed IP address to the unit. I chose a fixed address outside the DHCP pool addresses in my DD-WRT firmware router. DHCP is OK, but much less convenient if you want to get access to your camera from outside the firewall, i.e., over the Internet. This requires changes to your WIFI AP/Router (most of use have on unit with these functions). Also, get and save (write down) the default gateway and DNS server addresses.I disabled the WIFI, enabled the Ethernet port then I just plugged in the Wansview into my laptops Ethernet port with the CAT5 Ethernet cable that came in the box - after setting the TCP/IP Alternate Configuration to use the 192.168.0.X address to match the cameras default 192.168.0.178 address; rebooting the laptop (as Windows XP recommended; WIN7 & Vista experience may be different) wait for Windows to default to the Alternate configuration (after no DHCP server is found) in TCP/IP General tab. This takes a few minutes. Then enter the cameras default IP (192.168.0.178) and log in using the default admin/123456 password (noted on the bottom of the camera).Set a new admin username and password with some strong password features - one that you can remember/write it down someplace!  Log out and log back in with the new admin account you set (NOT a Visitor account!). This tests if your privileges work. Lastly, change the default admin user's password!! Save these settings.Select DHCP or Assign a new IP address, Gateway, and subnet mask (typically, but not always 255.255.255.0; yes, you need this info up front!). If you plan on using WIFI, instead of wired Ethernet, you will also need your WIFI AP's setup, like SSID, WEP/WPA/WPA2, and whether your AP is setup to use AES, or something else. And, yes, you will need the password!When you make certain changes to the IP address/DHCP and WIFI setup the Wansview may reboot to save the new settings. Keep in mind once you SAVE the new IP address/WIF AP settings the unit will reboot and you wont be able to connect to it using the default 192.168.0.178 (Or other IP address prior to the change)!If you make a mistake - like I did in assigning an inappropriate address (in the DHCP pool) or turning on DHCP in the DHCP pool address range, the unit may be hard to talk to again! I tried two restore to factory defaults, i.e., resets (with a paper clip inserted into recessed hole on the bottom of the unit - do NOT use a lead pencil, the graphite filings may cause a short), but not all the settings seemed to clear.. had to look up the DHCP address from the router's DHCP list in DD-WRT; your router's DHCP list may be harder or easier to find/use.The camera image flip (when you mount the camera upside down, like in a window sill) is a nice option in the functionality of the camera as are the PTZ controls. The bottom of the camera get quite warm during operation.I purchased a Mr Beams 3D battery powered light with motion sensor (from Amazon) to shed light for the camera to take a nice mug shots of would be burglars outside my windows.The bright LED light casts a light on the subjects, and counteracts the IR bouncing off the window pane and leaving no usable images otherwise (normal for IR).

I have better than average computer skills and took it as a challenge.  Shipping was quick, packaging was easy to open.  I hunted around the house for an unused ethernet cable to use for set up.  When I found one, I opened the box and viola, they provided one with the camera!  I should have taken this as a sign that wansview has stepped up their game a little.  I didn't. I sat the disk aside without noticing it is a full size disk now.  I opened up my router set up, dug around for the ip of the new camera and really worked like crazy for two hours, following every bit of advice I had read from reviews and websites about this camera with a mac. No luck, it was there on my network, but all I got was a response from the camera in my browser window that \"it works\".  I gave up for a few hours and did a funny thing. I looked at the disk, that I assumed was windows only.  It didn't read in my mac so I popped it in a windows laptop.  Surprise, there was a mac install folder on the disk! I copied that folder onto a thumb drive and ran on the mac.  Ta-da!the set up was done in a minute, all I had to do was double click on the set-up and double click again. Done. Would the disk have worked in my mac if I tried it again? I don't know. But if I had not set my self up for this being hard and just looked at the disk, I would have been done with set up, wireless set up and port forwarding for remote access in about 20 minutes. Access from a web works fine on safari and firefox, IE has a few more features.  I couldn't make head or tails of the wansview iphone app, but between the free ip cam app and the one for a couple bucks, the paid one allowed me to use the pan,tilt feature from my phone.  very cool. The picture is very clear, even with the camera pointed out the window to outside.

I am an experienced electronics and IT guy and this thing gave me a couple of moments.  First off the vertical axis was assembled incorrectly on the \"wrong\" side of the motion stops.  It would only travel one way.  Knowing the only option was to return and swap I went ahead and rotated it by hand past the stops which is usually a big no-no as the stops can be damaged.  I got lucky and the unit worked fine after that.Getting the unit online was a hassle.  For whatever reason the PC search program would not find the unit on my network in spite of ensuring it was on the same router - never did and STILL doesn't after getting it setup properly.  Turns out my MacBook found it easily using the Macintosh find app on the CD - except the provided CD is not in a format the Mac will read!  I had to copy it to a thumbdrive on my PC and run it that way.  Luckily it worked and I discovered that the unit has a default IP of 192.168.0.1 which you should be able to type into the browser as [...]and it will bring up the unit's web server.  This IP *should* be on the bottom of the unit but it was not, nor was it mentioned in the docs - although it is alluded to in the screen captures that show it as 192.168.0.178.After the hassle of just getting it to work and then finding it on the network it was a piece of cake to set up.  It works well, good quality video.  It works well with port forwarding to view across the internet.  There is an app on Android that works very well to control all features from your smart phone or tablet.The alarms could use some work.  When set up to send emails it attaches 5 pictures.  I would love for this to be adjustable but I understand it is to minimize bandwidth and processing.  It would also be nice if it would save video clips to a local drive but in fact I see no way to save video at all which is a disappointment.

Great value for money, I feel, so 4 stars.

But towards the end somewhere they sped up. My theory is that this thing was reaching out to home base for firmware or something (little scary), but I have no evidence to prove this.- I also needed to let it do whatever it was doing before iOS Safari or ios apps would attach. Even over LAN. After whichever reboot it was, they just started working, and before that reboot they didn't work at all.- Best Ios app is the FREE \"camviewer\" - set this camera up as foSCAM. Maybe they just realized that their name had SCAM in it and started re-branding.Things that I haven't resolved:- WEIRDEST THING: every time this thing reboots my router registered this via DHCP with a different MAC address (over wireless at least). I went with a static IP address.- WORST FEATURE: Sound from camera to the PC / ipad / iphone is pretty bad hissing on it. I haven't tried via Wired connection, but this is through 1 floor with some insulation, but only ~7 feet total distance from Dlink N Xtreme router.- 2nd WORST FEATURE: Firmware download not available on Agasio web site (or anywhere).

Unless you have some extra bucks to throw away and enjoy a challenge. IMHO, I believe that these cameras are rejects that the various vendors are just buying on the cheap, and then sending them back out as new. Said vendors are counting on the buyer settling for being suckered, or finding a way to make it work. I also think most of the positive reviews for this camera are planted by the vendors.The camera arrived without any written documentation at all. It did have all the parts and hardware. It also had a little mini-cd with some helpful discovery, and display software, some configuration software that \"sort of\" works, and some comically written docs. It was labeled with an Agasio brand name, and not the Wansview I thought I was ordering. That right there, tells me it's a resold reject ... Never the less, I soldiered on.Be warned (again), I don't care what these \"positive\" reviews says. Installing this camera is not for the feint of heart, nor for the networking illiterate.I'm another one of these genius, professional networking guys, who earns his living managing and administering corporate wired and wireless LANs and WANs. I install and configure networking hardware of all classes, from the little home routers, access points, and switches, to the big enterprise firewalls, routers, bridges, AP's, etc. I do it 40 to 60 hours a week. Been doing it for a couple decades now. I only mention this to support the premise that I know my way around wireless (and wired) setups. I certainly know my own home network. It took me three days of \"playing\" with this thing to finally accept that this camera is not just tricky, but truly defective. The transceiver in the camera I have does, in fact, NOT work! So, if you have one that just works when directly connected, but does not work wirelessly, it isn't you or your router, or whatever. It's the camera!!I did get it working on my my wireless network, but had to connect it, via the ethernet port, to a radio device that is designed to be used in wireless networks to connect individual computers that have no wireless capability. It is now out in the garage monitoring the comings and goings of the cats that live out there, and watching for any two legged intruders too.I use Firefox, and/or the display program that came with the camera for viewing. It would never worked with Internet Explorer (even in compatibility mode). The email notification \"tested\" ok, but I have yet to receive a regular intruder email alert from the camera. I can also web into the camera from work without a problem.CONs: All the above ... and ... the audio dosn't work (don't think there is even a mic, or speaker in it). Picture is very bad quality (tried adjusting the lens, but only makes it worse). You can see movement and determine whether it's human or animal, but that's about it.

(OLD TITLE:  No frills IP camera, could be better, but not bad for the price)", "Author": "Dan", "ReviewID": "R2UO6KLEIRC14I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "****UPDATED REVIEW****Reduced to 1 star.Multiple attempts to get this working with the program \"motion\" on Ubuntu have failed.  I was able to extract the jpg URL from the web interface and have \"motion\" connect to the camera, but I could not get it to capture a complete image.  The pictures captured were corrupt jpgs (a portion of the picture appeared grey).My work on capturing images ended when this product began to fail completely.  First, the web interface would lock up (normally right after there something in the field of view moved).  Then it would fail to connect entirely.  Now, I cannot access the web interface at all and \"motion\" does not capture any images.  It took approximately 4 months for the camera to fail completely.Another negative on this camera.  Each camera has a dynamic DNS address associated with it - xxxXXXX.nwsvr.com (where xxx represents a 3 digit number and XXX 4 letters).  From what I remember, you cannot turn this off.  This could make it very easy for someone to identify IP addresses with cameras (just change one of the 3 digit numbers and there you go).  Given the relative simplicity of their web interface and security, it would not take long to write a little script that guesses the password on a given DDNS.  Meaning, there's a good chance someone could be watching you if you have one of these in your house (assuming your router is not blocking the port).  I didn't get a proof of concept working on this before the camera puked, but it was enough for me to go into my router and ensure ports were blocked to prevent this from communicating outside of my local network.I have not given up on the idea of using we cameras as a DYI security system.  But this camera (and the multiple re-branded versions of the same equipment) are off of my list.****ORIGINAL REVIEW****Originally 3 stars.Pros:- It is a $50 IP camera with pan, tilt, and night vision.- The IR \"night vision\" is fantastic for such a cheap camera.- The web \"view\" page gives you the functionality you need in a minimal interface.  Makes it quick and easy to manipulate the- The built in tools give you the basic functions you need to be aware of what is going on in your home.  Email alerts, ftp upload (of pictures only, no video uploads though), motion triggers, scheduled alarm times.Cons:-No security (https) for the web interface!  If you set up port forwarding, the entire world can see what ever your camera is pointed as, if they know your password (which is limited to 12 characters).  The problem here is, that your password is sent via plain text.  If someone manages to sniff the wifi packets (or picks up your traffic between the outside world and your router), then they will have your password and will be watching you.- No audio.  I haven't tried viewing using Internet Explorer (or Windows, for that matter) yet, but I have no audio on the web interface.  I'm leaving it at 3 starts because I really don't care about the audio, but since it is listed as a feature and isn't available on most browsers, I'm docking it a star.- Resolution limited to 640x480.- A user interface designed by engineers.  The user interface is the most basic possible while still providing the advertised functionality.  There is no polish here.  There are no help files.  If you don't understand what it is asking for, you're out of luck.  Do you know what what SSL for SMTP is?  If not, you're going to have trouble.- The focus ring is near impossible to adjust without completely blocking the lens.  Which means you give it a little turn, move your hand, wait for the picture, check it out, try again and hope to notice a difference.- No zoom (but it is a $50 camera).- The IR lights on the camera are very visible in the dark, so don't expect this camera to hide very well with the lights out.Overall:For what I paid, I'm happy with this camera.  It will serve the purpose for which it was purchased (security camera  for the house).  It gives a decent picture in the daylight and produces a night time picture which exceeded my expectations.  You can clearly make out faces (from approx 30ft away) in either lighting condition.I am fairly disappointed with lack of security on the web interface, and that the ftp function only captures pictures.  To fix both of these, I plan to discontinue using the built in functions and instead use a spare computer running Ubuntu and the program \"motion\" to handle the duties uploading motion captured video to my ftp site.  (The temptation to have a live view of the house may overcome my concerns over password security though, so the web interface may stay active.)Setup of the camera does require a slightly above average set of network skills, so be warned if you don't know what things like subnet mask and DDNS mean.I plan to purchase a few more of these to cover additional rooms of the house, and would recommend it to someone looking for a no-frills IP camera.", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Do not purchase if you want this camera to be viewable outside of your home network.", "Author": "J.

It would only tilt in one direction. When it tilted as far as it would go, it would be stuck there. So it is going back to Amazon. It provides a good picture compared to my Panasonic BL-230A, but it sounds like its motion detector will not provide a video like the Panasonic. So I am not sure if I will get another one. Maybe I need to spend more money. The installation instructions were pitiful. And the installation DVD was a hassle to use.Second try: Raised the rating to two stars. The first purchase attempt produced a product that provided a very  crisp view, but was obviously broken. The package had very little padding and things looked wrong when I took the camera out of the box. But after I got a full refund (including postage, I thought I would give it another try. The second version came today. The camera was securely packed in Styrofoam. Instead of the tiny playing card instruction that came with the first, there was a CD that had a manual and a video on how to set things up. It was on one of those little two inch CDs that often get stuck, but it ejected on command Of course the both instructions suffered from bad translations. Things went well in setting up for a local network with wiring directly from the camera to the router. But getting the thing to work wirelessly has so far eluded me.The LAN setup was easy, but the getting the WAN working was a challenge. At one point, my messing with the router software caused me to lose all wi-fi reception. The cause putting a range of ports in the port forwarding. When I just mentioned a single port, wi-fi was restored. It seemed like I tried the same WAN setup many times, but it finally worked using the address on the bottom of the camera. I spent much time on this project and don't plan to spend anymore time trying to get a wireless connection. Instead, I am going to buy a 15 foot Ethernet cable.I have a Panasonic network camera which was not a breeze to install. But there came a point when I simply clicked a button asking for access via the internet and a working Internet address popped up. Nothing like that with this camera. The picture from that Panasonic camera is not great, and it sometimes forgets its address, but the setup was much easier than for this camera.Update: After I returned my first defective camera, I quickly got a refund. Then I read some Amazon review and decided to give it another try. It took me an age to get the WAN and the wi-fi working, but both are now functioning. Now I need to figure out what to do with the problem cause by the night view through a window. The infrared lighting turns things into a big blur. It seems that my options are to tape over the infrared LEDs or to ensure enough outside lighting that the LEDs don't fire up.My initial rating was one star after receiving the defective unit. Then I got an email from the manufacturer urging give more stars. My rating now is 3 stars. The picture is great. The pan and tilt functions work well. And you can't beat the price. But the setup difficulties require a lower rating. I sure have learned quite a bit about my router from messing with this camera.I would refer to this camera by brand name, but I don't know the brand name. The camera shown in the Amazon photo is marked as Wansview. However that name does not appear on the camera, on the box or in the instructions.Update: I was about to order another of these. until I read a comment about the Foscam network camera.

The only reason I am not giving this a 5 star is the documentation couldn't have been better, you can tell that this was translated into English at one point in time. They could have added some more details on some of the feature descriptions and the english was a little off at times. As far as use, it is very easy to use and the remote features are great.One thing to keep in mind, this is an indoor camera with infrared, my plan was to place the camera above our garage and keep a watchful eye on the driveway however if you take your time and do some research you'll discover that infrared does NOT do well when placed up next to a window, there are qualities in the glass that cause the infrared light to reflect back so you end up with a halo effect or glare which renders the camera useless at night but it does work fine during daytime hours when it's light outside. This is no fault of the camera so I can't hold it against it, same issue with all infrared devices.I have instead redeployed the camera for interior monitoring and piece of mind knowing that when we are away it will capture and send me snapshots of an intruder as well as being able to bring up the camera from our phone or pads from where ever there is a network and look over things (with full pan/tilt support). Without a pane of glass in the way the camera works great at night, we are able to see our entire living room with all the lights out and the motion and audio detection works like a charm, I immediately have 6 snapshots in my mail as soon as the alarm is triggered by motion or by audio.You will need to do some network setup with this camera (just like any other IP camera), you don't need to be a network guru but for most home networks you will need to know how to go into your router and configure port forwarding if you want to access this from a network outside of your home (plenty of help info out on the web). As far as configuring the camera itself on the home network I did not have any problems (I use uVerse and have a 2wire router). The setup menu is controlled via a web browser, more function in IE then other browsers. You can configure multiple userid's to have snapshots sent if one of the alarm functions is tripped, all alarm functions are configurable so you can active motion detection and audio detection, both of which have multiple levels of sensitivity that you can adjust (1-10). You can also attach a speaker and talk through the camera which I haven't try yet, kind of neat telling someone to get the he!! out of your house :) One tip, for initial setup you need to attach the camera to your router via a cat5 cable, once the initial configuration work is done and you have configured your wireless setting you can detach the camera and place it anywhere that your wireless network will reach.I have had the camera for several weeks now and no problems, will probably purchase one more except will get the ourdoor version for the driveway. The only other thing I am struggling with is getting the camera to work on ROKU, there are a couple of ROKU camera apps but so far no luck at getting this to work under them, once again this is not a showstopper for me as it does work well with computers, cell phones (IP camvew application) and tablets. I also like having the ability to turn on the camera led which you can have blinking all the time (want to be seen) or you can turn the led off if you want to make the camera a little less noticable. I would have used the LED to monitor my driveway as I want people to know they are being watched but inside my house I want the camera to stay hidden. There is a little glow from the infrared at night, not enough to be distracting but you could track the camera down if looking for it, if this happens I'll already have their mug shot in a couple of in-baskets as the mailing occurs within seconds of tripping the alarm which can be adjusted to be very sensitive to motion, audio doesn't appear to be as sensitive which probably is determined more upon the location of the camera.For the money, this camera meets my expectations.

When I first set up the wireless, without problem, (thanks to the other great reviews here,) I was dismayed to see that the picture on the monitor was extremely fuzzy, to the point that I couldn't make out the features on the human test subject. (my son.)  I emailed the company to ask how to repair that problem.  Granted, I DID skim through the instructions on the disk, but I did not see how to refocus the camera in them.  I tried the brightness/contrast controls, and it didn't help at all.  Today, when I looked to see if I'd heard back from the company and saw I had not, I decided to take matters into my own hands.  On the front of the camera is a movable wheel around the lens...  I sat my son in front of the camera, then went back and forth between the camera then the cpu to slowly adjust the 'wheel' (actually more a ring).  Turning that wheel counter-clockwise brought my camera into a MUCH clearer focus.  On my camera, there are only the words \"night vision IR\" printed around the wheel.  So, if your camera is fuzzy, try slowly adjusting that wheel.  -Thrilled the camera wasn't a dud!  The other thing I was surprised at was the instructions which said to keep the camera between 14* and 122* Fahrenheit.  (I converted centigrade to Fahrenheit.  -Great, but it ALSO says to keep it under 85% humidity.  I wanted to use this thing outside. I live in a rainforest.  Likely not going to stay under 85% humidity.  Also the thing obviously, being electric, has to be kept dry, so, in a rainforest, can't be installed out of doors.  Cant be in direct sunlight, cant be moved while plugged in, - don't move it while setting it up.  My CD came with the user manual loaded, but all the graphics were missing from it, so I went to the website and downloaded one.  -Much better.  The manual's setup instructions really are adequate, except I had to read reviews to comfortably set it up wireless.  I have a LAN, (local area network), so didn't need the WAN ( wide area network,) setup.  To turn off the green blinking status LED light, once its set up and you are viewing the video from the camera, go to 'advanced', then 'other' setting and turn it off under status LED mode, top line, using the drop-down.  Its then, while in the dark, very dimly-lit with the pale red lights around the lens.  Not hidden by any means, but not glaringly obvious, either.

Considering the failure to use them on the internet by the buyers, I can see why they don't respond.", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Doing Its Duty", "Author": "Mr. Wilson", "ReviewID": "R1P0MEC5JTO8MZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for the unfortunate purpose of monitoring one of my children. He has some severe behavioral issues. I figured that being able to monitor his activity would help to (a) hold him accountable, and (b) prevent issues from happening in the first place. Amazingly enough, it seems to have worked. After six weeks with the camera in the house the rate of certain types of incidents has dropped precipitously. That means we can put our efforts into helping him in other ways.I found the camera to be relatively easy to set up, but I had the benefit of a strong tech background combined with some really great setup instructions in some of the other reviews. Buyers who aren't tech savvy will probably want to recruit a helper.The camera works more or less as advertised. Once it's connected to your local network you just plug it in and start watching. You can monitor and adjust the camera via the included web interface, which works well enough. You can also use third party monitoring solutions. On one computer I have used iSpy64 for monitoring and recording. On my Android phone and tablet I use Tiny Cam Monitor Pro; that app allows me to not only monitor the camera when I'm at home, but also when I'm out and about.I didn't expect much from the night vision, but it actually works surprisingly well. Interestingly, the night and day vision sometimes work simultaneously. Because of where I have the camera mounted, sometimes half the frame is bright and the other half is dark. The camera shows both at the same time with little problem. I have to admit, though, that it's a little creepy walking through the dark house at night and seeing the LEDs glowing a subtle, but menacing, red. There's a definite Big Brother vibe. For our purposes that's exactly what we want; our son's nighttime shenanigans have ceased because he knows the camera is staring him down.Those of you looking to take advantage of the camera's audio capabilities will probably be disappointed. The camera has a microphone but the listening experience is pretty poor. It might be useful for use cases where you want to hear a specific sound in an otherwise quiet room (i.e. a baby monitor), but that's about as far as I would go. You can also send audio to the camera ... IF you attach speakers. I don't have any to attach so I haven't tested that feature.All in all I'm pleased with this purchase for the money I paid.

This is not an HD camera and we did not expect perfect image clarity, but both my wife and I were happy with how clear the picture is when viewed on a laptop or small handheld device. The tilt function will not allow a view much at all below the horizontal, so if you want a viewpoint downward from where the camera is positioned you will need to mount it with the base horizontal (e.g. on a wall, or a tilted tripod).The generic IP camera mobile application we use to view the camera (the one recommended in the camera documentation) is 'Bi Smarteye'. As with several of the other technical parts of this camera, it is not the easiest to setup but once it is configured it can be used quickly and with little confusion. It allows you to control the pan/tilt functionality remotely, to mute/unmute the sound, to speak to/through the camera's built-in audio-out connection and to take screenshots of the camera. We have use this functionality all of the time to take snapshots of the baby and to monitor him while out of the room.One important thing to note here is a slight annoyance - the connection between the smartphone app and the camera will timeout if it loses focus (regardless of how long it was running in the 'background') such as when the screen is allowed to lock or if you switch to use another application. We have found a workaround for the screen locking issue by simply disabling screen locking when we need to watch the camera on iPhone for prolonged periods of time (cooking, showering, etc).The nighttime IR view is as good as any night-filming camcorder that I have seen and you can even configure the green 'camera in use' light to turn off so that it will not cause as much light pollution in the space where it is installed. There is a much smaller red LED that will remain on when the IR mode is in use, but it is much less intrusive.Once connected to your wired or wireless network the camera functions well to be viewed from a laptop or handheld device via its IP address and, while I have not used it yet, does provide the ability to connect to a dynamic DNS service so that you can reach the camera via a website name rather than its numerical address (or from the internet if you setup port forwarding). Unfortunately, the administrative console does not provide much in the way of support for long/complicated passwords and is not SSL enabled so password data is being sent to the camera unencrypted which will likely prevent me from making it internet-accessible.The initial setup of the camera on the network is fairly complicated, but once it has been setup you are able to un/re-plug it in and move it around easily without having to change any settings. You will need to plug the camera into a wired network first (where you have access to the router to find the IP address that was assigned to the device) once you have the wired IP address you can connect in and configure the camera to join the wireless network. Once joined to the wireless network, you will need to rinse and repeat the process of finding the cameras IP - in my case, once the camera had been assigned an IP I created a reservation for it on the router so that the IP would not change every time the device was reconnected.The camera comes packed with a bunch of features that I haven't had a need to use yet (mostly centered on security monitoring type functions) such as emailing screenshots upon sensing motion and timed operation that looked pretty neat.All told, I like the camera enough that I would buy another one if a need for a security or 2nd baby camera presents itself.", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best camera for the price.

It does work as intended, the setup involving port forwarding (purpose of viewing on mobile device or computer not at home/work/location of camera) is tough for those who are not tech savy, but if you are a fast learner, then should be tough only once. After you have set it up, you remember it for future problems if any. I did have to activate the camera by plugging it directly into my router with an ethernet, after it was activated, wireless for the remainder of the setup. I did install the software from the CD, it is just a managing tool if you plan on recording on a computer directly. If you have only intentions of doing remote viewing, then the software on the CD is not needed, but you may want the pdf file for the directions of port forwarding and what not, as it does guide you to what to look for (very limited guide, but can put 2 and 2 together). There is a lot of lacking on this camera though, and it is my first, so I cannot comment if this is normal with other cameras or not. The lacking is, this is not a smart camera, So you may set up a motion detect alarm for a certain time, well in some cases it will just do the whole day instead of what you put the alarm for (example, I only placed motion alarm from midnight to 5am, but it kept sending motion alarm pictures to my email 24/7), so that part has failed, it did use to work a while ago. You can set up username and passwords for multiple people, family, friends. and can make them an administrator or operator, this is a poor feature as an operator you cant really do anything, so you pretty much have to make everyone an administrator. NOTE: The only way you can turn off the camera, is by unplugging it. Yes you do have a \"power\" button when your viewing in the browser or mobile device, but it only disables YOU from viewing it, so if two people are viewing it remotely and you hit the stop button to turn it off.. it has no effect on anyone else currently or planning on viewing it, MUST unplug it. The manufacture should greatly get on the wagon with enhancing the features as this camera has great potential. I would still buy it knowing what i know now. it is well worth the price... However, it does matter greatly on the location of the camera, cause once you are beyond 10feet, you cannot tell clearly who is there (unless of course you know them), so if a burglar comes in you will never get a good shot of him/her depending on its location. The only thing really you would be able to make out if a robbery occurs is, what they took, not who they are. I am NOT ordering more of this type of camera as I do need cameras that can get clear shots of faces for recognition in the event a burglar does enter.

I purchased it over a year ago and still think it's a great camera.  The only thing it does is reset every so often on it's own, but that isn't a real biggie.When I saw the Wansview, I did a little research and came to the conclusion it's basically a renamed Foscam since it looked almost identical to my current camera.  IP software was similar as well.I didn't have any issues setting it up, but focusing was much more problematic than was the Foscam. Also the IR seemed to be brighter than the Foscam, which was a good thing.  Also, you could not create preset camera positions.  Still, for the price, I liked it alright. Sooo, I bought another.This one was trouble from the start. It just did not want to connect to wifi.  I finally found that if, after I set it up, I would need to unplug, hold the reset button (which is really, really small), plug it in and reset it again.  For some reason, this would cause it to adhere to the wifi. But if any little thing happened, it would lose the connection.I did notice the software and firmware was different than that of the first Wansview I had purchased. Thinking no big deal, I'd just download updates....good luck with that.  They just aren't there.  Wansview does have updates for Foscam cameras, but don't say if they are to be used with the Wansview models and if so, which ones?Another thing is that I could tie the first Wansview in with the Foscam software for multiple devices. The second one would not connect.  I ended up having to buy Blue Iris, which I have to admit is a good program.  The only problem is that the software must run all the time for it to serve to my DNS. If I could have just tied them in with the Foscam software, or their own software for that matter, I would not even have to leave my PC on.Yesterday was the last straw.  I pulled up Blue Iris and was greeted with my trusty Foscam image and two other images with colored bars.  My frustration peaked at that point and I just unplugged them both thinking they would hopefully sell in a yard sale for a few bucks.Before I do that, I may just go ahead and try the Foscam firmware and software updates offered on Wansview's website.  If I do, I'll come back here and share my results.April 22...Well, I decided to keep them.  They're back up and running, but not sure why.

You need to know some computer networking knowledge to do it. BTW, you NEED to download the new version of the IPMonitor software to view it properly.2) The not so good side is that this camera uses Wireless-G standard (even though it says support 802.11b/g/n). Why do I say that? Because the range is very short, and it won't connect if I put it at the same distance as my Cisco Wireless-N IP Cam location.

There are other free software available on the market to use with an IP camera so probably better off trying one of them instead.

You've gotta hook it up to the router to get the wireless to work. Once you've got your software downloaded to your computer, you can run it from there.I'm running through google chrome (not IE). Let's see if I recall correctly...because the \"quick setup\" instructions seemed to be a lot different that what actually needed to be done.Run the IPCamSetup, client, and appinstall. One of them makes you restart your computer. Once it restarts, there's an icon with a video camera on it (mine showed on the desktop). When you click it, it'll open a window. If you're cam isn't plugged up to the router, that window will be blank. Once it does show up, it'll be an IP address. Double click that and it'll open up a web browser where you can set everything up. Wireless connection-- tell it to scan. THEN SCAN A SECOND TIME. For some reason it won't work on the first try (even says this in the instructions). Click your connection and then to use it. There's info to fill out under that. Then submit.Your cam will reboot, and the browser will do a countdown for you. Wait until your cam stops moving, then unplug the ethernet cable from the cam. Now, I had a bunch of trouble getting it to work once taking the cable out. But I ran that scan again after it was unplugged, and somehow it decided it was gonna work.From there, I put my camera down in the basement where I intended to set it up. Upon plugging it back up, its connection was still good. You can control everything from the web browser view, but I like the client app because it's smoother. But while your browser is open, if you want it to email you upon motion detection, you'll need to set it up to do so. This is under the \"other\" option. It's a little confusing if you don't use smtp stuff often. Basically fill out your email addy in both the sender and recipient boxes. I use gmail, so in the smtp box you would type smtp.gmail.com. Port box: 465 and choose TLS from the dropdown. CLick the Need Authentication box and fill out the next set of info, which is your email addy and your email password. Now...that little test button says to test before clicking submit, but I couldn't get it to be successful until I submitted. You may not have the same problem. It'll send you a test email, then. And to make sure your alert is set, go jump around in front of the camera and come back and check your email! Alerts are also set up in the \"other\" option.It took me a better part of the afternoon to get this set up...But hey! It's working and I spent a small amount of money!

They don't.  If you are looking for one or two cameras to use as a remote web cam they will work okay.  But the video quality over the internet is quite poor.I connected just 4 cameras to a wireless router, so data congestion on the router should not have been a factor.  The video clarity is okay, certainly not half as good as standard definition television, but not too bad.  But the frame rate varies wildly from 15 frames per second (fps) to zero, frequently locking up for half a minute at a time.The built in web page that is used to interact with the camera is pretty good, but you will spend several hours tweaking the settings to get it to work the way you want it to.  If you want to access it from outside your home you will need to know how to set up port forwarding on your router.  And you'll likely need to contact your ISP and get them to bridge your modem (lets just say they're not plug and play).  You do have the option of accessing the camera through a Chinese website.  So please password protect your camera in the settings!  Because as it comes in the box a Chinese website will have access to your video stream.  I personally don't trust their discretion.Now the audio.  The microphone on the camera is okay when listening to faint sounds.  But they quickly overmodulate when someone talks nearby, and voice quality becomes unintelligible.  Also, the intercom feature is useless.  Many sellers incorrectly imply that the camera has a speaker.  In fact one side of the yoke is designed to look like a speaker.  But it isn't.  There is instead only an audio out jack that you must plug a speaker into.  If you do you'll find that the volume is not controllable, and is always low.  So to work as an intercom as advertised you'd need to plug a powered/amplified speaker into the camera.  If you do this you'll find that it is still useless, as the audio is so intermittent that it sounds like your talking to China on a cheap cell phone with zero bars of signal.Basically, don't expect much from this cheap camera.

Etc.  Deal with it Bubba, you got a PTZ camera for $50, now shut up.Once you start focusing on the features and capabilities, you realize a few things:1) Camera performs EXACTLY as I expected.  It's not great, but it's better than being blind.2) Documentation is minimal and is written in Engrish.3) Web interface is written in Engrish as well.4) It takes someone who understands what they want to figure out all the corners of this thing.5) The web gui has some pleasant surprises that aren't documented well.So item 5 needs some qualification.

Although they look similar, they are different, but produce the same result.The only problem I had was with my router.  The D-Link DIR-601 does not use 'Port forwarding' for web viewing with this Wansview camera.  The D-Link uses a 'Virtual Server.' I tried 'Port forwarding' and DMZ for hours before my programmer son saw the tiny print on a small enclosed printed 'Quick Start' guide that showed using a 'Virtual Server' on a D-Link router.Follow these steps for a D-Link DIR-601 router.Set the wi-fi on the camera for 'Set IP automatically' and restart camera.Use the program on the CD 'BSeries Intranet Search' to find the camera and it's new IP address.Type the IP address into the address bar on your web browser, Firefox, IE, Chrome etc. and see if the camera is working.  Go to 'Maintain' in the camera menu and under 'Device Info' you will see 'MAC' you will need this set of letters and number in the next step.Open the D-Link router configure page in your web browser Firefox, IE, Chrome etc. 192.168.0.1, the default is 'admin' with a blank password and go to Setup > Network Settings > Add/Edit DHCP Reservation.  Click enable, make up a name for your camera then in the drop down tab select \"ipcam_****'. Type in the IP address given to your camera and the MAC address from the above step.  Click save and go to the top of the page and hit 'Save Settings.'  After the router reboots check the same page and see if you camera is on the 'DHCP Reservations List.'  This step will ensure that this IP address is not give to another computer.Go back to your camera page and select 'Network' and uncheck 'Obtain IP automatically.'  Make sure your IP address is listed in 'IP Addr' along with all the other IP numbers.  Change the 'Http Port' number from 80 to another number of your choosing from say from 1030 to 1050 or just about any number will work.  Now hit 'Submit.'  When the camera reboots, type in your camera IP address in your web browser and add your port number after a colon  :1030 (sample 192.168.0.107:1030) to see if the camera is still working.Next go back to your D-Link router page, then ADVANCED > VIRTUAL SERVER.  Check the box, name your camera, then in the drop down tab select \"ipcam_****'. add your IP Address add your port number from the above step in both 'Public Port' and 'Private Port' and 'Save Settings' at the top of the page.On your D-Link router page go to 'Status' and under WAN towards the top of the page find your routers 'IP Address' this number will not start with 192.168.x.x.  I have Cox internet and mine is 68.x.xxx.xxx.  If you can find your address use findmyipaddress . com.  Type this into the address bar of Firefox, IE, Chrome etc. and add your port number to the end (sample 68.x.xxx.xxx:1030) this will show you if you can now see your camera outside your home Wi-Fi on the internet.  If this worked you can see your camera anywhere in the world.Some internet providers change the router IP address often, others like Cox, not so much.  Wansview provides a great built-in service that will always point to your camera even if your router IP address changes, this is the xxxxxx.nwsver . com address.

On the D-Link router go to TOOLS > DYNAMIC DNS to set it up, if you want to use it.There is a Wansview forum at Wansview . net, that may give you some more help.All of these cameras use a standard 1/4\" camera mount on the bottom, so you can get a standard 1/4\" bolt and mount it to a spring clamp and then mount these cameras just about anywhere.So far so good.", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Foscam Review", "Author": "Brianna", "ReviewID": "R3ASWENDMVHNXK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera has good resolution and once it's set up it's easy to use especially from the iPhone.

It does have programmable \"cruise\" and it does have a go to a predefined position after an alarm but then it stays there and there is no way to reset it automatically.Likewise with uploading to a web site, you don't have much flexibility with that and the description of the upload settings is very confusing and scattered through out the software.I am still getting pictures with incorrect times and not sure why even though it is supposedly synced to my computer.I like the sound and motion detection capabilities but wish i had more options on what to do during motion detection like how long the video should record, or how many pictures to take, or the interval. There is some of that but very limited.The night vision LED being on all the time makes the colors during the day look washed out. It should turn off in daylight ideally.Every time it starts up it goes to 16 window view and i have to change it to 1 window view.Its ok.", "Date": "July 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great - especially for the price!", "Author": "Canaryunion", "ReviewID": "R302OF0NJTGLDN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this to use as a baby camera on most days and home security when we are away.

Wasn't expecting much in the way of quality and functionality at the $5X price tag, but I've been for the most part pleasantly surprised.Pros - easy setup,even with the poorly translated instructions; the included software does a good job of quick setup - however, you should have some fundamental knowledge of how your home network and router work; all parts are included that you will need for installation; good night time viewing with the IR light, mic and speaker on the camera (although external would be better quality); low cost; seems to be a clone of a number of brandsCons - washed out images outside (no IR-cut filter in the camera makes daytime photos look very washed out, almost black and white; MAJOR issues with getting the cameras to go wireless, 5V power supply wall wart - very small and sounds like they may be prone to failure from other reviews.The washed-out daytime images are not of great consequences, as I am using the cameras to monitor my animals in the pastures.  Looking for a low-cost IR-cutoff filter that may be able to be added and improve the quality. However, the images are clear and cameras were focused as received.  Mounted under the eaves, so we'll see how environmentally durable they are as time goes on.I've tried a number of times to get the cameras to operate on the wireless network, but so far, no luck.  I've found several related posts with ideas, so I'm going to give these a try this weekend.  Right now, I've had to run 100' lengths of CAT5 cable from the router out to the cameras as a temporary fix.  They have a 400 mW wireless output, so if I can get the wireless side going, and they are used with a directional gain antenna, they should do OK well away from the house.Cameras operate very easily from inside the network, and as I've got a static IP address, very easy to hook up to and operate using software available for both Android and iPhone.  Goal is to have these uploading to our alpaca ranch website.  I've not set up any of the alert features, as I didn't intend these as security devices as much as monitoring ones.Overall, so far I'm impressed with these $5X cameras.

I'm not certain that the setup is different, but I'm guessing it might be due to the conflicting information I received by reading reviews. My camera is branded EasyN. I'm posting this review to share what I learned in setting it up with a Mac and WiFi. Hopefully it will save you some time if you are doing the same. Some reviews mention being able to install a Mac version of the software. The disc I received did not include Mac software nor did the website, so I used the web interface for my setup. When I began setting up this camera, I connected it to my router with the included ethernet cable and nothing happened. I unplugged the power and then powered it up again. I kept looking for it on the network, but nothing. There was also no blinking at the ethernet connection which led me to believe it wasn't connected to the network. I finally found a mention on the internet of the reset button on the bottom of the camera. Per the instructions, I held the button in for approximate 30 seconds to reboot the camera. At that point, the camera finally showed up on my network. Using my router's configuration interface, I determined the IP address for the camera by looking at the DHCP list. I then entered the IP address in my browser (Chrome) and clicked on the link to sign in to \"Server Push Mode\". I went to the wireless configuration page, scanned for and found my network, and entered the password. Every time I unplugged the ethernet connection to the router I lost the signal. One review mentioned that the password could not exceed 16 characters. I reluctantly changed my password and it still didn't work. After searching and searching, I finally found a mention that the camera has two MAC addresses, one for the ethernet connection and one for the WiFi. Once I realized that, I did a search of my DHCP list again and found another unknown device. I typed in that IP address, and was finally connected via WiFi (using my much longer than 16 character password).Due to the lack of information and the conflicting information I found in reviews and elseware on the internet, the setup was a bit complicated but once I got it set up on my WiFi network, I was amazed at how well it works. I downloaded the iCam iPhone app and computer software. It was incredibly easy to connect the camera to the iCam app. Now I will be able to monitor my home when I'm away. I will probably buy another one of these to cover other areas of my home. Besides the complicated setup, the only thing I don't like about the camera is the very obvious blinking green light on the front. I would prefer to hide the camera and the light makes that a little hard to do.UPDATE: I figured out how to turn off the flashing light. In the web interface go to PTZ Settings.

The procedure is pretty much sop for adding wifi objects to your net.1. Configure the cam to work on your net using the RJ45 cable plugged into the router or a switch plugged into your router. Using the enclosed cd load the Bsearch or Hsearch (depends on cam model). Mine was a B. Using the program do a search for the cam. when the cam is found.Click on it. Follow directions on setting the cam net configs. The paper included directions work good (if you can read them). The manual is on the cd (pdf)and much easier to read.2.Using the assigned IP enter that into your web browser (I use Fox)The login should popup. The login stuff is located on the bottom of the cam. If the login doesn't pop up then redo the cam IP config. Its easy to make a typo...3. A visual screen should show the cam pictures. Now to the wifi set up menu. Enter the wifi specs for your net. Make sure you select the proper security encription mode for your net(info is on router). When the cam is searching for net the led blinks slowly. When it connects to net the led blinks rapidly. This is the normal online blink.4. Now disconnect the RJ45 cable and the cam should be working on wifi and show up on your network scan. My Kindle Fire has a neat freebie app net scanner..The infrared works great. Colors are a bit washed but detail is good. Might have to do some adjustment for bright daylight (use online config menu).

Radke", "ReviewID": "R2PJE0F7QNJ5FT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Initial thoughts:I was able to power up the unit, plug in the Ethernet, and login to see video within minutes! First, the IP address of the unit was unknown because I plugged it directly into my laptop not into a network with DHCP. Standalone, my units IP is 192.168.1.111 and uses port 81. I do not plan to hardware so my next task was to setup the wireless. My wireless configuration screen is missing some of the details in the manual but it seem to connect just fine (like the static IP section is gone). Unfortunately, the unit does not show my its IP on the wireless side so I had to determine that from my router.*Warning: Some technical jargon ahead for the geeks. (I'm a net admin so troubleshooting is 1st nature)Here is where the frustration came in. Although I could ping out to my local network and the Internet from the camera fine, I could not reach the camera's IP (over wireless) from any workstation on the LAN. With wireshark I saw that my machines could not resolve the camera's MAC address. For some reason my camera would not respond to ARP requests. If I setup a static ARP entry on any box I could get to the camera just fine. This is definitely a problem for tablets and phones on the network. I saw nothing in the manual or the config of the camera that had restrictions enabled. Eventually I saw the reset button on the bottom of the unit. I held it in for about 30 seconds (probably didn't need that long) and it rebooted. It defaulted the config (good) and I setup the wireless within 10 seconds. Now I can reach the camera via wireless! I have no explanation as to why it was failing from the beginning but I can only hope that it will continue to work.Otherwise, the camera appears to be rather full featured. I'm excited about its functionality and the picture is really good. I plan on using and managing it exclusively without windows which I think is workable for most features.

My inbox is filled with pictures of nothing different. - It only sends a picture once about every 5 seconds when it *thinks* it is sensing motion. - Image quality is not good enough for my purposes (identify license plates) - Often jpegs are corrupt - sometimes blank, sometimes the pic is visible but the file has bad bits causing error in thumbnail (using gallery software to organize pics with thumbnails)All in all, it's not a bad camera - especially for the price.

It's not even the camera advertised on the product page.  The one I received is called the B Series IP Cam.  Nowhere on the device does it say Wansview.  I know I'm not the only one as many others have reported names such as EasyN, etc.#2.  There's no excuse for such poorly written instructions.  The sad part is...you can tell that they tried.  I felt like I time-warped back to 1996, when setting up simple devices like a printer or router meant spending hours pouring over manuals and dealing with software installs and settings and stabbing yourself in the throat. What a mess.#3.  I got it set up on a wired connection in 5 minutes.  I then input my routers credentials and the software said it was connected via wi-fi.  So I unplugged the network cable and sure enough...it was connected via wi-fi and everything worked fine.  But when I unplugged it and plugged it back in...nothing.  WTF IS THAT?#4.  The quality isn't very good.  I know it's only $50, but c'mon.  I can get an entire Android phone that can do wi-fi, play games, music, videos, browse the web, and take HD video for $50.  You're gonna tell me they can't build a decent wi-fi camera that runs at more than 15 fps for $50?#5.  For seemingly no good reason, the bottom of the device has a bunch of open vent slots on it...so don't think about putting this outside or anywhere where it might be damp.#6.  I can't really say why, but I wasn't successful in setting this thing up with about a half dozen different IP camera viewer apps on my Nexus 4.  I even purchased a few pay versions to see if that would make a difference, but alas I was unsuccessful.

I have 4 of these cameras; one of which was purchased from Shopping Cloud. The camera died within a couple of months of owning it. I contacted them and they asked me to ship it back so that they could, in fact, verify the camera was dead. After having the camera in their possession for 4 or 5 days their technical support staff agreed with my assessment; the camera was in fact dead. They shipped me another camera and I was back in business for a few days. The camera was not communicating with the software and was, for all intents and purposes, useless. I found that unplugging the camera and then plugging the camera back in brought it back to life...for about 3-4 hours. Over the next week, after having to \"Reboot\" the camera every 3-4 hours to get it working, I decided that I was fed up enough to engage with them again. It's been all down hill from that point. They told me to update the firmware and included a link to the firmware in their response. What they didn't tell me is which of the two firmware update options to choose. I e-mailed them again to clarify which one of the update options I was supposed to use. A waiting a few days for their response, I was told that I needed to update via the correct option, or I would \"Toast\" the camera. They did not, however, specify which one was the correct option. To make a long story short; I am a pretty experienced \"Techie\" having worked with computers and related hardware since the early 80s. With a little research on my own, I successfully updated the firmware without toasting the camera, but to no avail; the problem has not been correced. I have sent three e-mails looking to get resolution to this problem since October 25th and have received no response from the company. Fortunately the other three Wanview cameras I have work flawlessly. I need to resolve my problem, but I have given up on Shopping Cloud. In retrospect; I've spent more money [in terms of my time] than the camera is worth. I'd have been ahead of the game if I simply purchased another camera. Needless to say I am very frustrated with this experience and with Shopping Cloud!", "Date": "November 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera, bad network cable, iffy power connection, poor setup (why can't they just use DHCP?)", "Author": "S. Taylor", "ReviewID": "R3SV9BNHIHQ7B4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My first impression of this camera was pretty poor.  Fresh out of the box I hooked everything up and saw absolutely no activity (status light remained off, activity lights on the router were dark) so I assumed I got a bad one.  In keeping with the defeatist tone of the Chinglish instructions (\"Connect Antenna to WIFI port and screw it\") I requested a return with Amazon.  I was preparing to box it up when I decided to give it one last try with a different known-good network cable.  That made all the difference.  The included cable appears to be junk, so if you have problems, don't give up on it until you've eliminated that issue first.I naively assumed that the front status light would at least flicker on boot or something to serve as a power indicator, but it's sole purpose is to show network activity.  So without a network connection the device appears to be completely dead.  Lesson learned.I wish the manufacturer had enabled DHCP, but I was prepared for the headache this camera's fixed IP would bring.  I read other reviews suggesting that the camera ships with a 192.168.0.178 IP address, but mine didn't respond at that one -- it turned out to be 192.168.0.139 instead.  The way I figured it out was by plugging the camera directly into the ethernet port a PC with a fixed IP of 192.168.0.28 (so these were the only two devices on the \"network\") and running this from a cmd prompt:  for %a in (1,2,0) do for %b in (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) do for %c in (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) do ping -n 2 -w 100 192.168.0.%a%b%cThis just pings every address in the 192.168.0.xxx range at a fairly fast clip (and some invalid ones outside it too -- it's just a kludge to find the camera).  Keep an eye on the results and once you see a response from an address other than your own, you've determined where your camera is.  I made it check the .1xx range first to save some time, based on other people saying the camera was at .178.  That turned out to be a good guess for me since it found mine at .139 on the 40th try.I was also able to connect to the camera from my Android phone using IP Cam Viewer Pro by selecting Wansview NC541 as the model.  At first it was only able to view images -- none of the controls (Pan, Tilt, Relay, etc.) worked until I realized I had configured the account I was using as a \"Visitor\".  You must give that account at least \"Operator\" access for those controls to work.  Once I solved that mystery I was very happy with the camera.Picture quality is a bit rough, but I didn't buy it to shoot feature films.  The clarity and resolution are good enough to see what's going on, but the color is a bit flaky.  The IR night vision seems to work very well.My only real gripe with the camera -- and it's probably limited to the unit that I received -- is that the power connection is loose, so if I pick up the camera to move it, it reboots.  Thankfully it does at least reboot.  It hasn't lost power completely yet, but time will tell.  I might need to disassemble it and resolder the power jack to the board someday.  (To be clear, I haven't lost power from the camera's own pan/tilt motions, only when I physically pick it up.)Speaking of pan/tilt, this is my first PT camera so I didn't know what to expect but those movements cover a surprisingly broad range and are much quieter and smoother than I expected.  There's no zoom support as far as I can tell, but since this has a fixed lens it would be digital zoom anyway so no real loss there (it may be supported but disabled since I set it to the highest resolution).  It even has a tripod thread on the bottom, with a nice wall mount that I look forward to using once I figure out where to put it.  The relay support was an unexpected bonus.  Maybe I'll hook it up to the doorbell to keep my dog entertained while I'm not home.All things considered I'm happy enough with the camera at this price that I purchased a few more.", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "unreliable", "Author": "Richard", "ReviewID": "R1QWVQEQOV48N9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Second camera from Wanswiew.

You can give it an alias in whatever monitor software you use, however you cannot change the hostname of the device itself.  The final gripe is the software that ships with the camera.

I could move the camera, and it had night vision - what a deal, right?  Then I tried to make it available over the internet.  Wow - difficult!  It turned out my DSL modem which was connected to my wireless router would not work because the modem was changing my IP address and had no DMZ functionality.  I ended up switching to cable internet and got a much better modem and that solved my problem so I could now access it over the internet.  I even got an app for my iPhone and could view and control the camera from it.  You can listen too but the audio is terrible and delays the entire feed by almost 30 seconds when turned on.  So at this point, I could live with the bad audio because I wasn't planning to really use it and thought I was basically home free.  However, last week the camera randomly would not load from my iPhone or internet, and I found that I had to log in from my house and reboot it.  Hmmmm.  It then happened 2 more times.  Then today, I set it up to forward me emails when it detects motion.  This was working great for about an hour....but then it would suddenly stop sending emails for no reason.  I'd reboot and then it would be fine for awhile and then stop.  Then the grand finale - the wifi just stopped working completely.  There is a little green light that flashes when it is connected to the network and it would not flash.  I rebooted several times.  Nada.  I plugged it directly into the router via ethernet, restored it to factory settings and redid everything.  Nada.  Made sure all wireless settings matched between the camera and my router (just like I did when I first received it and got wifi working).  Nada!

Price", "ReviewID": "R2TSNUWDM5B0NG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was disappointed that this camera's method of transmitting video is not a true video stream (such as accessible by RTSP protocol) but instead just uses DHTML to rapidly update a static image.  To the typical user this might be acceptable and it \"looks\" like video, but it means you can't send your stream to re-broadcasting services like Ustream or Justin.tv.Justin.tv's FAQ states that \"IP cameras that you can watch using VLC are supported.\" With some research I was able to find that there is an HTTP URL format that does actually work with VLC:[...](where username:password is a valid account you have set up in your camera's configuration and n.n.n.n is the camera's IP address)However the frame rate of this \"stream\" is only around 2 FPS at best. Nevertheless, I found a video somewhere that shows how to stream to Justin.tv from VLC using a tool packaged as jtv.rar in which I just had to edit 2 batch files to provide my camera's URL and my Justin.tv broadcasting key. This worked, somewhat... The video as viewed on Justin.tv, in addition to being just 2 FPS or worse, was now VERY low-resolution and/or high-compression, making it entirely useless. When this is compared to the nice 30 FPS stream I get from a standard-def camcorder hooked to a video capture card and uploaded using FMLE, one can understand my disappointment.As for the camera itself, the quality is OK but doesn't adapt to bright lights well. We got this camera to view our second bearded dragon, and the lights in its terrarium and anything they directly illuminate are washed out to pure white on the camera, no matter what brightness/contrast settings I use in the camera configuration.As other reviewers have said, the pan/tilt features on this unit are nice. It's just a shame that the camera itself and the streaming protocols it uses aren't of the same quality.", "Date": "August 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good product, bad software, bad service.", "Author": "Pamique", "ReviewID": "R2KHHUTA58245V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera is very cool, and just what we need to keep an eye on our home when we are gone.
