He ordered two of these hoping that they'd be better than the other brands he'd been using for several years.  He actually liked the screens better, the icons and all were better placed so as to not block so much of the pictures as on the Defenders, but that's where the better stopped.  The monitors kept freezing on one shot, meaning that if someone wasn't fully aware of what to look for they would only see what was going on outside their door when the picture froze and not what was out there at the immediate time.  Not very safe and certainly not what one has every right to expect from a security camera/monitor set-up.  The monitors also went blank quite often and did not illuminate as well as the other brand, but the real security risk was their turning themselves off/freeze-framing and having to be turned completely off and then back on again to get them started again.  The seller made returning them extremely difficult and it turns out they like to charge the buyer return postage and restocking fees, etc., that would  mean receiving less than a 50% refund.  Amazon to the rescue again.  Their A to Z guarantee can't be beaten.  The manufacturer kept sending links that didn't work and that kept prompting \"security risk\" warnings and had to be told so multiple times before they sent the return label required as an email attachment.  I've never had a worse buying experience and if you think there is any chance you may have to return an item my suggestion would be to make sure the seller is strictly Amazon and not a third party, which was not clear to my husband on their sales page or he would have passed on them to begin with.  Again, many thanks to Amazon for resolving these problems.  You're the favorite shopping place for our family.  :)", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DODU4FG"}}
