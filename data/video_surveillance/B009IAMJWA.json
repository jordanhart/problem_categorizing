The quick install guide is very poor beyond very basic setup.  The detailed user guide on the CD is good but lacks enough detail in certain cases.  For this need I called support and got an agent who wanted to pass me thru to a \"senior agent\" after I explained the problem.  I had to be at my camera before we could do this.  He gave me a support ticket and said to call back at that time.  I made arrangements to do this (we are 6 hours apart so not easy within their hours).  On doing so I waited a long time to get an agent when I explained the issue again and provided the recall ticket number.  She took me through all the same identiy info and problem detail then opened another ticket and passed me through to the seniors again.  I was placed on hold again for over 30 minutes and decided to leave my call back info which was an option.  I was told a call back withi 30-50 minutes.  This was 90 minutes before their closing hours.  The return call NEVER came.  Exasperated I sent an email again explaining my issue.  It's now into 3 days and no response to that email.The product may be good, only time will tell, but I would not recommend nor purchase again simply based on the 180 degree difference between pre-sales and post-sales support.

Unfortunately this product is still buggy. Video quality is good but motion detection and alerting is unreliable. In my case I have the camera monitoring the front walkway of my house from a window. Sometimes the wind blowing leaves outside will set it off, other times people walking right up to the camera will be ignored. Scheduled recordings are hit and miss.

We wanted to do some casual  spying on some of the critters that live around our house and property, and since this was small, with a host of flexible features for set up, it seemed a great way to start scouting locations. The capability to turn off the indicator lights is also nice, as mice are bothered by flashing lights. The camera has largely met expectations; we certainly didn't expect gopro level pictures. The infrared dark mode is actually clearer than the color, which suffers a lot of pixilization. Warning, if you don't do the Wifi setup manually and just use the WPS, it will set up with no security.However, I hope the software department at Lorex reads these reviews, because they could improve this system greatly, and retroactively.The recordings on the card are taken in less than 1 minute clips and you will lose up to 30 seconds between each clip. You have to view them as individual files, and you can't even ask the software to play them in sequence, you have to select each. You can't do any file management from that window, either, but must go to another program. That program allows you to delete or download them one at a time and every time you do an action, the folders close and you have to reopen to access the next file. That sort of thing is just rude. Your best move is to  take out the card and use the file manager on your computer to manage files of a type you can't (or I can't) view with any normal viewer. If the clips are limited in size by the slowness of the card writer (the card I am using is the highest rated for speed on the market) then the frame speed of the recording to the card should be lowered so that the video is choppy but continuous.The recordings to a PC are at least continuous, but viewing them is almost as frustrating. Once again, there is no real file management. The viewer looks a bit like the old Adobe Premier interface, but the bars and sliders don't seem to actually do anything to control playback. It always wants to start at a beginning point of its own choosing and go to the end. You have to get it to fast forward and then make sure to slow it back down when you reach the points of interest. If you manage this feat, you can then set it to convert the selection to .avi and edit that in a real program. This would not be an imposition if you could just control the slider or have some forward and backwards buttons.Finally, the player indexing program keeps suffering a string reading error, and the only solution is to delete the recordings folder.  A little software reorganization, a firmware upgrade and my camera would get 4 stars.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera technology, but horrible software interface", "Author": "A. Kinard \"Tony Kinard Photography\"", "ReviewID": "RPM66SS7OZB50", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After a lot of research, I bought 2 of these to try out - mainly because of some glowing reviews and great camera specs.  While the cameras show great promise, the software to interface, control and manage the cameras was unforgivably horrible.  I repeat: HORRIBLE.  It looks like they had some of their engineers cobble together some software from their commercial legacy stuff to try and pass off to consumers and they failed miserably.  The usability is nowhere near friendly nor polished enough to target the average consumer with.  The user manual only comes digitally as a 180 page pdf that is riddled with mistakes and inconsistencies.Bottom Line:  Promising cameras, but overall experience: Buggy.  Difficult to deal with.

Two weeks latter it went \"offline\" and I needed to have a computer guy go into my place and \"relink\" the camera.  Not cheap!! Now it is off line again after about three weeks.Lorex says I have to reset the camera in FL, I am in PA. This camera is not good to monitor a vacation home far from your home.

No reply so far.", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fast and easy to set up", "Author": "Steve Williams \"Steve W.\"", "ReviewID": "R23TEJ60LH2AU7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had two wireless cameras that worked okay but my WiFi would cause interference so the picture was not always great plus the range was not that great so I decided to search for a camera that would use my wireless.  I found the Lorex IP camera and decided to give it a shot.  When it arrived I sat down and plugged it into my hub and went to work on setting it up.  I had a problem early on but the problem was not with the camera it was with me.  I use MAC authentication and the camera actually has two MAC addresses.  You are only made aware of one MAC address and that is for the wired connection.  You will have to disable your MAC authentication on your modem briefly to perform the WiFi test.  Once you have a successful WiFi test you can go to the information tab and get the WiFi MAC address and add that to your allow list and enable your MAC authentication again.  FYI, you will not find a WiFi MAC address until you have a successful WiFi test.This camera actually works great for the most part.  I am not impressed with the motion detection however.  I suspect the problem with the motion detection might be how I am using my camera.  I have it mounted in my window looking out monitoring the approach to my door.  The camera will not detect a person but will detect the change in light.  I suspect the fact that I am trying to use the motion sensor through glass is the problem.  infrared does not always play well with glass.  I have not tried testing it any other way because motion sensing was not all that important to me.  During my testing the camera was set up to email me and it did a great job at doing that at dawn when the sun started to come up and at dusk when the sun went down and at night when the headlights of a passing car were detected.  This was with both PIR and motion activated.  The onboard IR light is worthless if you are mounting this camera to look out a window.  All it will do is light up the glass nice and bright and not allow you to see anything.  This was not a surprise at all and I did not expect it to work through the glass.  This camera is nice but it cannot perform magic.  If you are using this monitor spaces inside a building I suspect this camera and its PIR & motion sensing will make you very happy.I also have a NAS and the camera does connect to it and I have 7 days worth a video recording and the video is overwritten after 7 days.  I am also using a SanDisk 32GB Micro SD card for recording video and that works great as well.  I was so pleased with this camera that I ended up getting a total of 7 cameras.  After getting all 7 of them set up I did have some stability problems that I needed to work through.  The cameras were losing connection and it was very frustrating.  The solution was to allow the cameras to automatically handle resolution and frame rate.  If I remember correctly that is the default setting but I had changed that on all of them.  Once I did that all the cameras stayed connected.  I was able to run 6 cameras at a higher resolution and frame rate with no problems but adding the 7th camera pushed my WiFi over the edge.  The more cameras you add the slower the frame will be.The Lorex Ping android app also works great so I am able to check all seven cameras from work with ease. I have one camera that has the microphone activated and I am able to listen to what is going on using this app.  I have not played with the speaker and alarm option and do not plan to so I have nothing to say about that.All in all this is a great little camera that is really easy and fast to set up and not all that expensive.  The image quality is excellent and I am impressed with the cameras ability to see in low light situations without the use of IR but there does need to be some ambient light.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice features, poor build quality.

Now everyone at each site can see everyone else - this is a perfect solution for us. Researched a lot of cameras before buying this system. They really need to market this camera better.Pros:- They are super easy to set up - no messing with IP addresses, etc. You just need the camera ID and anyone with the camera ID/password can view the camera from the PC, tablet, or smartphone software from anywhere around the world.- Software supports up to 16 cameras on all at once.- Cameras can be deployed in any location around the world with internet access. Tested setup with both ethernet and secured wireless, both work fine.- You can configure each camera (internet bandwidth used, time stamp, etc.) from anywhere around the world- Base camera is relatively inexpensive and can be upgraded with speakers, microSD cards for storage and playback. You don't have to buy anything you don't need.- Camera has both day and night (infrared) mode- Camera doesn't have to be connected to PC to automatically record events (motion capture)- You can record to the microSD card on the camera and also to your PC- No monthly fees as with other IP camera video hosting servicesCons:- Camera has no point tilt zoom- max resolution on camera is not HD (not a problem for use as we set the camera bandwidth to the lowest setting to save on internet bandwidth)- Camera software is still somewhat buggy, still a work in process.
