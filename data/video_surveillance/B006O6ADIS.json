Even those who don't know networking should be able to get the camera working on their home network.But here's the first caveat.  The initial set up DOES require a hard wired ethernet connection to do.  If you don't have that you have a problem.Next caveat - after you get it talking to your network immediately do the software and firmware upgrades (if available for your model).  It's make for a much better experience.The night vision works VERY well for a dark room.  The web page that pulls up when you access the camera is easy to use.  With 10 seconds of instruction my wife was accessing the camera, moving it around, etc.And the image is impressively clear.Now for some shortcomings.  First - the power cord is only 3-4 feet long.  The short cord limits where you can place or mount the camera.  Ideally the camera should be up a little higher than eye level.  But unless your are going to install a custom electric outlet that's tough to do. Of course you do have an option to splice the power cord or use and extension cord - not real good options aesthetically for going up a wall..Shortcoming #2 - I had wanted to put it in a window looking out for security.  Works fine during the day.  But the lens is encircled with LED's that it uses for night vision.  When placed to look out the window these LED's reflect off the glass and make seeing anything outside impossible.  And since it is not weather proof just leaving it outside is not an option.  I don't know if it would have the same problem of reflection in a weatherproof enclosure.  And putting it outside one would have to deal with issues of power and the short power cord.Next caveat.  I can access it from my Android smart phone.  I tried it both using a browser and also an app.  Yeah, it works.  But the features of motion are erratic at best and leave a lot to be desired. +*+*EDITED March 6, 2013 - the new app for Android and the new web page for viewing have corrected this problem", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Baby Monitor", "Author": "Marcos Garcia \"Veremos\"", "ReviewID": "R18ZG3YC3UTNUD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this product with the purpose of monitor my baby in his new room. The camera has a great price and features. The quality of image is very good. These are the cons for this camera for the purpose I'm using it:The camera reset itself frequently with the on line tool and loses the point you were looking at and the audio.If I go to sleep and the the camera resets itself, I lose the baby view and the audio because every time you start the camera, the audio needs to be turned on.I found an alternative solution to stream with VLC and it does not reset as much (once every two weeks) and the audio is on all the time which is vital for my inetented purpose because when you are sleeping, what is warning you if something is wrong is the audio. But still the audio has delay and after a few hours becomes intermittent.I have the camera in a wireless mode. I will try to connect it with LAN to see if it will improve.***Update***Using VLC and a LAN instead of wireless, the camera does not reset the position and the delay of the audio is only 2 or 3 seconds but I can live with it.

Vernon \"FrankenPC\"", "ReviewID": "R3FPB0CQ68AV5F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "OK.  So, it's probably obvious at this point that the camera's are all clones.  If you've scanned Amazon for IP camera, you've probably seen a dozen of these same cameras under different names.  So, this review applies to all of them.  I'm not singling out {insert Chinese clone hardware retailer here}.Firstly, the IR filters have  been removed to give the sensors night vision capabilities.  This causes weird color shifting.  The sensors being used are very low resolution and low grade.  Also, the on board micro-controller dishing out the Wi-Fi, video/audio compression, motion control, etc is very under powered for all its tasks.  In other words, all corners have been cut.  That's to be  expected for this price point.Second, SINCE these all are the same hardware, the differentiation is the software support.  Again, not much difference.  I will say that the main difference APPEARS to be one of two things:  audio support and mobile device application support.  For instance, I downloaded the Android Foscam IP video viewer and  it worked with the Tenvis clone. Tenvis claims to have two way audio support.  This is a misnomer.  It REALLY only works with a highly specialized IE plugin.  Running  Win 7 x64 with IE 9 and 10, I have yet to get it to work.  So, forget audio.Finally:  performance for the actual task.  OK, if you are INSIDE your home network using a browser like Chrome on a fast PC, the video and pan/tilt support is very responsive.  Deceptively so.  It's only when you go outside the firewall do you see how incredibly laggy the camera is.  It's almost unbearable.  I think I'll  ultimately install GotoMyPC on my Android tablet and remote in to view the video on Chrome ON my internal PC.  A lot of work to get decent video.  That's what you get when you go cheap.Pros:  CHEAP to the point of being nearly disposable.  Who cares if it breaks.  For an internal security station, these would be ideal.  Easy to make the initial connection and configure (as long as you completely ignore the install instructions and realize the IP address is printed on the bottom of the camera).  Pan and tilt are smooth.  Works at night.  Small and light.Cons:  Capabilities are misleading if not outright lies.  My overall impression of the support software is that it's in early beta.  MAY want to pay additional bucks for a camera that uses more sophisticated software/firmware especially in the video compression arena.", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Would be great if it worked...", "Author": "Erin R. Deatrick", "ReviewID": "R27P3BWK5FXXVM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "ORIGINAL REVIEW 1/7/14:I bought this camera to be able to view the footage from my android phone.  I was able to set it up for viewing on my computer on my home network easily so I thought this was going to be a breeze to set up.  Well, I was dead wrong.  To set up the remote view (to view from an outside computer) you have to set up a static Ip address and do some port forwarding.  I can read directions, so I went to the forums to figure out how to do that.  Hours and days later, I was able to get it to work most of the time .  But the remote viewing on my Android still wasn't working.  But it was weird, because it would work sometimes (about 5%) and the rest of the time it said \"Camera Feed Not Available.\"Then the remote viewing from a computer completely stopped working. So I emailed customer service, and he was very timely in his responses.  But remember they are in Beijing so that adds another layer of difficulty.  He did some remote assistance and was able to get my remote viewing from another computer to work (he changed the port number).  However, he checked the settings on my android and said they were right. But it still didn't work but he had no further suggestions.  I downloaded multiple viewing apps thinking maybe that was the problem, but none of them work.  But remember, it worked a couple times on my phone, so I know the settings are correct. I've tried it on 3 different phones, both android and iphone.  It just simply does not work 95% + of the time.  Also, the night vision has not been working either.  So basically, this thing is worthless to me.  And I have wasted SO MUCH time trying to get it to work I am completely frustrated and decided to call it a loss and find something better.If you are just looking for a camera just to view from inside your home network, this may be ok for you because that part was easy to set up.  And as long as the night vision doesn't go out like it did on mine, you may be ok.  But if you want remote mobile viewing I would stay far, far away from this one!UPDATE 1/27/14:My rating has changed from a 1 star to a 3 star. I increased my rating because I was finally able to get it to work correctly after hours and hours of trial and error and help from a third party product. I can only give the actual product a 3 star because the built-in DDNS didn't work. The process of setting it up and the support gets 0 stars.  I was determined to get this thing to work with my mobile view (I had so much time invested, it was getting personal, lol).  I knew that since it worked about 5% of the time, that the camera was capable.  I had a feeling the entire time that it was a problem with the DDNS (the website you use to log on from a remote device). I asked the support person if this could be the case, but they kept telling me no, that everything was fine since they were able to connect to the DDNS from China. Well, they may be able to connect from China, but I couldn't here in the US.  So I decided to do some research on DDNS (I'm not a technical expert and have never dealt with this before).  I found some instructions on the foscam website (they make a very similar camera) on how to set up an external DDNS instead of using the one built into the camera.  I used No-ip, and low and behold, it worked!!! Now I can view from my android and it works 100% of the time. I was so excited (literally hooting and hollering in my living room) that after months and months I finally got it to work.  So if anyone is having the same problem as I am, try no-ip.com and click on DNS. You'll then have to go into your camera settings and uncheck the built-in DDNS and fill in the info for the third-party DDNS. It wasn't too complicated to set up.  You'll be glad you did!  Or better yet, just return it and get another one, hopefully you'll get lucky the second time and get one with a properly functioning built-in DDNS.  But the bottom line is, the built-in DDNS is faulty on some of the cameras and doesn't allow you to connect remotely, and the support team should have known that.  I'm so mad that I spent so many hours on this and it was a somewhat easy fix.  Hopefully this will save someone out there about 40 hours of pain.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect in our nursery", "Author": "Heather T.", "ReviewID": "R1EH7VURU2IFL0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We actually use this camera in our baby's nursery!

Installation was easy--you just connect it to your router first with a CAT5 cable, and the software will guide you through the process of establishing a wired connection, then a wireless connection, and finally an Internet connection (using port forwarding from the Tenvis web site). That last feat means you can access your video from any Internet device: laptops, iPads, smartphones, etc. Cool! This is much more than one of those little USB webcams. It's actually a little wi-fi webserver that you can remotely control!To achieve the night vision, these cameras must be sensitive to the infrared wavelengths (by removing the IR filter). That introduces many surprises. For example, some daylight colors appear a little goofy (e.g., blue-gray trees). And while you can see people and objects near the camera that are within reach of the LED lighting at night, realize that in infrared, everything will essentially be black and white, with warm, reflective things appearing bright, and cool, absorptive things appearing dark. It's tempting to place the camera near a window (great during the day!), but don't expect to see through the glass at night--all you'll see is the reflection of the bright infrared LEDs.The pan tilt feature really works well. Pan is almost a full 360. However, the tilt (up/down) motion is mostly \"Up.\"  If your main interest is looking down (to see your pets or little children, for example), your best bet is to mount the camera inverted (using included brackets) and choose the \"vertical flip\" option in the camera setup.Note that you can turn off the blinking green LED using the web page configuration, making it pretty stealthy. Few people will notice it sitting on the bookshelf, doing its thing! Speaking of web page, did I say it was a mini-web server? There must be at least a hundred configuration settings and parameters under your control, via its \"settings\" web pages. Very geeky, if you're into that sort of thing.The wi-fi feature allows you to locate the camera anywhere within range of your home wi-fi router. All you need is an electric outlet to plug in the power supply. Hint: replacing the provided antenna (SMA connector--nice!) with a high-gain wifi antenna will greatly extend how far away from the router you can place the camera.It's too bad this camera is not rated for outdoors.

If you can set up a wifi router beyond the defaults, you can do this.  Port forwarding was straight forward for me but someone more of an advance network capability for some.My thoughts on the unit itself.  It will not withstand a drop from a counter.  The plastic is cheap.  But that's what I would expect for an item in this price range.  It met my expectations.How does it look?  The iphone app is basic and shows what I want it to.  The web browser view is much better and offers many more options and user customizations.  One piece that messed me up for a few ways was that you need to create stored positions and then in the pan/tilt menu, set one of those as the default.Here's where it let me down.  The ALARM component is a piece of junk.  Like many reviewers on the Tenvis forums, the sensitivity settings are worthless.  I have it on the lowest sensitivity setting and each time the sun goes behind the clouds and changes my property from light to dark (generally), it sends me emails with attachments for several minutes.  However, when the Brown truck guy pulls in my driveway and into the cameras view, it totally misses that.So in conclusion, if you're looking for a camera to have fun with and to just check on the view of things at home from work or via the iPhone app, it's great.  If you have a realistic expectation for it to email you when and only when it senses movement or objects in view such as a burglar, you need to look elsewhere.", "Date": "June 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Tenvis Wireless Camera", "Author": "Lindsay S.

I ran it outside the window by my desk and activated it and the online veiwing platform and was ticked pink!!

I also wish they used a thinner flat wire that fit better between windows and screens.A flush mount would also be nice to be able to flush mount under the soffits for a heater look.The \"night vision\" is pretty weak. An add on directional spot ultra violet emitter would be nice as well and would greatly enhance the image quality of the night vision.For the price though I don't think these Tenvis cameras can be beat.

It continues to work well.  I decided if it worked for a year, it was probably a stable product and I came back to Amazon to buy two more.  I also bought an Agasio camera which worked for about 8 months when the night vision ceased to work.  I returned it back to Amazon.These 2nd and 3rd Tenvis cameras are pretty much the same as the first one (with a couple of differences outlined below) and were the same amount of work to set them up.  The things I have discovered about these cameras that help with their reliability are:  First I set them up with a wired connection using the CD that comes with them.  The CD software finds the cameras on the local network and it is very easy to set them up using this software.  It is not the most intuitive software, but once I figured out what to change, it seems to be very stable to use the software.  I gave the cameras a static IP address on my LAN so I would know how to find them.  The second thing I recommend is using the address printed on the bottom of the camera when outside of the network.  Remember to get into your router's port forwarding first and open up a port and send it to the camera's IP address.The first camera I got a year ago, I used an outside website to do the DDNS, and when I got the two newer cameras, I decided to try using Tenvis's addresses.  They seem to work flawlessly and now I do not have to pay the other company to do the updates to keep track of the external IP address of my network.Once I set up the cameras with a wired connection, I went in to set up wireless.  This was very easy and as soon as I rebooted all the devices, the cameras came up in the browser at the static IP address:port I set them to.  The wireless connection has remained very stable and as I expected, the frame rate is a little slower than a wired connection, but still very good.  The thing that does not work well on wireless is the audio, in or out.  I am using IP Cam Viewer on Android phone and iPad and it has a little icon to toggle sound on and off.  On a wired connection, it seems to work, albeit a little choppy at times, but on wireless, is kind of worthless.  I really am only interested in the video, so not a deal breaker for me.If you are willing to work through the set up and learn how to find the camera, set a static IP, port forward, get a viewer like IP Cam Viewer, then you will be pleased with this camera.  However, if you are new to setting up network things, you might be a little stymied.  I am pleased the first Tenvis camera is still working well and hope the two new ones are equally as stable.", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Ok product", "Author": "nbass", "ReviewID": "R3M2TWJ8CNBV8V", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It works but I would not buy it again.

I had looked at other, more expensive brands, but this one seemed to have what I needed at about half the price.As usual, being an Amazon Prime member got me my camera in 2 days, and I was curious to see how the install and usage would go. Putting it up was easy, I mounted it outside, under an eave, that allows me to fully rotate the camera on 2 sides of the house. Wireless is the only way to go for me, as my house is over 20 years old and brick, so no ethernet runs anywhere. I did have a power line running through a closet near where I wanted it, so I tapped into that and viola, up she goes. Once I had it where I wanted it, I took it back down (easy to do with the camera mounting to the mounting hardware with 1 easy to reach screw) to configure it.I assumed this would be the hard part, but honestly, it took maybe 30 mins to get it fully working on my wireless network, including port forwarding to allow me remote access. I tested from my cellphone on 4g, and it was perfect, near HD quality. (You DO NOT want to stream HD over your wireless network, unless you want it to crash and burn because HD video takes up a TON of bandwidth.) The picture is clear enough to read license plates 50 feet away in our driveway. A bonus I didn't even think about is the sound feature. With the built in microphone, I can actually hear our kids playing in the yard from 1000 miles away.All in all, I rate this a DEFINITE 5 star purchase. Well worth the money. I will be adding 2 more of these to the network soon.", "Date": "March 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love it!

These false alarms do not occur after dark so I suspect that slight changes in the sunlight coming through the window trigger the alarm, but closing the blinds on the windows and shielding the camera from direct sunlight did not help. If you want to just view the video feed it works pretty well but as an alarm/security system it is useless. Other downsides: motion detection warning tone does not work, some colors are shifted, images with motion are very blurry, and the instructions are in broken English.

Spend a bit more and get a Foscam or Wansview", "Author": "James Longfellow", "ReviewID": "R2R0F643CJPGXF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I currently have five of these type of cameras under four different brands.  There are a lot of imitations of the Foscam and they are not all the same.  Some are good and some are not.  This one falls under the latter category.  I had it set up at our camper in the mountains so I can keep an eye on the snowfall.  This one replaced an old one that stopped working, that I bought about six years ago.  It was trouble from the start.  First, you cannot view it from within the network, which is really stupid.  It takes forever for the router to recognize it.  More often than not I can't even connect to it from outside the network at all.  Then, when it does finally come up, it is agonizingly slow.  Slow to bring up an image, snail-like slow when panning and scanning with it.  It is very choppy.  It constantly cuts out and reboots for no apparent reason.  When it does reboot the camera goes all over the place and always seems to end up facing backwards.  And since it takes forever to pan, it takes a half an hour just to get it facing forward again.  I got sick of the aggravation and replaced it with my WansView camera at home just to eliminate the possibility that it was a slow network connection, and the WansView worked like a charm.  Connects every time and quickly, and pans and scans quickly.  Once I confirmed this camera was the problem I packed this piece of crap back in the box and returned it.  I bought a Foscam in place of it, and when that came I put that one up at the camper, and again it was very quick and easy to set up and connected quickly every time, and pans and scans quickly.  Three other brands of this camera worked perfectly in the same location with the same hardware, so this camera is definitely the problem.  Since there is only about two or three dollars difference between the Tenvis and the WansView, save yourself a lot of aggravation and spend the extra money.  If you want the absolute best pan and scan ip camera out there, get the Foscam.  It is more expensive, but it is the best.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Good for retail stores", "Author": "Zhijuan Wei", "ReviewID": "R1TA58U7OFZ467", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hey, guys, Sorry for give comments so late, I need time to install three cameras and get my new route setup.I bought four cameras for my store it functions very well.

The cameras tampered and modified various setting on my ASUS RT-66N wireless router without my permission, causing frequent internet disconnects and requiring a complete hard-reset and reconfiguration of my router in order to correct the issue. Customer service from the Tenvis manufacturer is non-existent. The cameras also (without warning) would randomly pan and tilt up and down, back and forth without my controlling the functions from the Tenvis software downloaded to my computer. I recommend anyone who is in the market for IP cameras (in general) to stay away from all makes and models, at least until the technology improves. Some food for thought;  Most of all IP cameras on the market today are BETA versions of anticipated improved future products. In other words, the consumers who purchase these gadgets are being used as \"test subjects\". The manufacturers do not want to invest money on quality assurance, which justifies the low price-point of these cameras. Anyway, I returned my Tenvis cameras back to Amazon for a full refund.

Turning the night vision feature on and off, a real necessity in interactive security maintenance, is cumbersome with this product.  I must mention that some products in this price range don't even have night vision though.In addition, maintaining connectivity - particularly utilizing Wi-Fi - is a real difficult process.  I often lost the signal, and I know it wasn't a proximity issue because the camera was only 5-7 feet away from the computer/router, and other devices that I linked to in this way, such as RoKu, worked a bit more efficiently in this regard.The picture is generally clear, however, and the corresponding programs are not difficult to work with (x10, with a product line with such potential, is such a hassle in this regard).To be very honest, Tenvis has requested this review.  I think this is a good thing if they are trying to improve their product(s), but because of the points listed above I cannot give them a perfect 5 out of 5 rating.

Pan/Tilt works well if not a bit slow.Bottom line... spend the extra $20 and get the newer model with the IR-cut.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "three stars because it works... but", "Author": "IZbraun", "ReviewID": "R18AM74GQAP7QF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I looked at this unit compared to the Foscam and decided on this unit.  I\u2019ll start by saying, it\u2019s worming\u2026 sort-of.  I can view the camera with any device (iPad, iPhone, Android, and Computer) that in connected to the same network but as soon as we leave the house and try to connect via the internet, it doesn\u2019t work.  Apparently, this problem has something to do with the internet modem I\u2019m using.  I\u2019m using this as a baby monitor so I don\u2019t really mind (in fact prefer) that it can\u2019t be viewed via the internet.This was NO easy system to set up\u2026 there\u2019s several steps that had to be taken and many of these steps were NOT spelled out in the instructions.  For example, my home network name had a space between two words (home network).  The system didn\u2019t like this but didn\u2019t specifically tell you, it just gave you an error message during setup and you had to guess what the error was.  There was no indication anywhere in the instruction either that this would cause a problem.  After a lot of trouble shooting I deduced the problem and I re-named my network without the space (homenetwork).  The system suddenly worked.  I also noticed during the trouble shooting process that in the set-up, you will often times have to enter the information twice or even 3 times for it to \u201ctake\u201d.  I\u2019d enter the information and the system would come back with an error; I\u2019d enter it again, and sometimes again, and it would suddenly accept the info.The instructions are not very easy to follow and there is essentially NO tech support for this product.  At certain points during the setup it would say \u201ccontact dealer\u201d.  I\u2019m pretty sure if I called Amazon for help I\u2019d be out of luck.  There is a phone number to call but it\u2019s in Hong Kong and unless you used Skype (or similar) the call itself would likely cost you more than the camera.I have no idea whether the Foscam is any better but next time I would probably pay the few extra bucks and get it over the Tenvis.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "IP CAM", "Author": "Luther", "ReviewID": "R1FU5UDPSRKXDH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This IP cam is great.

The software that came with the camera is similar the software included with the Foscam but the internet sharing application is unreliable.

I had to update/reset the firmware 3 times before it reported the latest firmware.  I was viewing my office via a cable connection in 20 minutes.  WiFi was also fairly easy, although I've supported computers/networks for decades, my Mom would not be able to set this up.  Then I tried to view it remotely (from another person's network), no dice.I ended up plugging the camera back into a cable and fiddled around and finally got remote viewing working.  I spent several hours on the manufacturers support page.  There are many support threads posted about this/other WiFi failures.  The tech support appears to be a couple parrots, repeating the same 5, or so, \"fixes\", until the user gives up.  WiFi is a pretty simple thing nowadays.Long story short, I bought a WiFi camera for WiFi, remote viewing.  It doesn't work, or this particular camera is doa.

I cannot get the software to load onto Internet Explorer on my new Windows 8 computer so I cannot get full functionality on the internet when I travel (the X10 works fine).  The camera keeps rebooting as if there has been a power failure when there has been no interruption of power.  Finally, the image freezes after a few minutes and only updates when I reload the page. This gives the impression nothing has changed in the room I am monitoring when that may not be true.  On the positive side, the camera has a very good picture and is easily controlled from the internet.  Great for an occasional \"snapshot\" of the room.  Not so good for ongoing monitoring.
