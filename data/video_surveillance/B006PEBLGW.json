{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The \"Price Is Right\"", "Author": "mg", "ReviewID": "R18YGGYRKEG4LF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This item conveys all movements as they occur, not in segments as other wireless camera-monitors by other companies. There appears to be a problem with overheating inside the monitor in previous GE monitor/camera packages I purchased which will eventually affect video performance,color, or will simply shut down for good. The latest purchase from Amazon has the best color and clarity of all previous cam/monitors purchased and well worth the money if you are securiity conscious in these days no matter where you live. Just make sure the product has plenty ventilation, dont drop it, and keep it away from moisture.", "Date": "September 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Workes great", "Author": "Bobby D", "ReviewID": "RD3VBOJ6L24YR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works Great and was ease to install.  Only problem the  screen on the receiver is way too small.  I know the picture will be a lot better after I hook up to VCR or TV.  I ordered the battery for the camera as it will not work if we have a power outage.", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little unit for price", "Author": "Bryant Yocom", "ReviewID": "R1NSYFOWM6J0M6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Meets expectations wish came with second even with just audio like most others do overall this is a great item and saved us when our other failed, thanks prime shipping", "Date": "August 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "home camera", "Author": "Mike Mccain", "ReviewID": "R2ES1KIZ82UA4P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "was shipped really fast,set up easy,just plug in and watch.all i have to do is gat a recorder next.might get wireless battery so it can't be unplugged", "Date": "March 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Small size, contemporary design\nWiFi Internet network friendly\nWirelessly transmits audio and video up to 200-Feet\nNight vision for viewing images in low or no light\nAudio detection and notification\nWirelessly Transmits Audio & Video Up To 200 Ft\nNight Vision For Viewing Images In Low Or No Light Up To 10 Ft\nView Up To 2 Cameras On A 2.5\" LCD Screen\nAudio Detection & Notification Alerts When Sound Is Detected Within A Monitored Area\nCamera For Indoor/Outdoor Use", "Name": "GE 45261 Portable 2.5-Inch LCD Monitor Wireless Analog Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41qEMx%2B9AhL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006PEBLGW"}}
