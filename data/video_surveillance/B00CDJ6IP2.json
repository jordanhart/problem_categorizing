{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Starter Kit", "Author": "Man Who Only Shops Online \"Mike M\"", "ReviewID": "RGFSX76F77X85", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this kit and I am happy with it. It comes with 4 cameras but has room for 4 more. The 4 cameras do not have sound and are not really full color or high quality at all. However, the DVR, the wires, the remote and the preinstalled hard drive are worth the money, so consider them free cameras. I would get CCD SONY Zmodo cameras to put in your important areas and use the provided cameras in other spots. Also, you might want to run higher quality wire when you install it in case you replace the cameras, you already have quality wiring installed. But, for me, this kit was perfect AS IS. I installed and set it up with Excellent support from Zmodo. I can see the cameras on my cell phone from anywhere. It records on the 4 included cameras for about 15 days before it starts recording over the oldest footage automatically. It has great motion detection settings which will detect motion and email you a picture! You can even block out areas of the motion so that only certain parts of the screen cause motion emails. Take note that when you are setting that up that the Blue Squares IS where it is looking for motion. That seemed backwards to me. Awesome, cheap starter kit. I can see it from everywhere. Great peace of mind since someone keeps breaking into my car to steal 4 bucks of change and last time they stole the whole cup holder...guess they forgot a container...next time, I got em!!", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "eye see you !", "Author": "mr.Q", "ReviewID": "R3B5GXEJV209OL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "purchased this unit may 15,2013,already added the 4 other cameras,picture is very clear,my wife and myself is very pleased with this system, tech support is very good,checked on alot of systems zmodo has great reviews,ir is good,you just have to adjust your cameras to your liking.The E-mail alerts work fine also,everthing so far so good,we highly recommend.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very cool user friendly system", "Author": "Ivrit, Hebrew, Israel, American, Jew", "ReviewID": "R3E8RKNYROKO4V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like this system.  But be advised I have called customer support three times and they were very helpful.  The nice thing about doing business with Zmodo is the customer support is FREE and UNLIMITED and the customer support personnel are Americans that speak our Language in American so we can understand them clearly.  You need two monitors a separate VGA Monitor for the DVR. A mouse comes along with the DVR for that monitor.  You only need one key board that is your computer keyboard.  You install the software on your computer.  You also use the Monitor on your Computer to run the Software.  I didn't set anything up for remote access because I don't have a smart phone.  Also it is unable to link the DVR to a Laptop.  I had to plug the Ethernet directly into my router.  The CS Rep told me that is because the Laptop Ethernet link is not both input and output.  This is a very intricate professional system because it can do so many things.  It is well worth the money.  Thanks to customer support it took less than a \u00bd hour total to get this baby up and online.  We have the system doing what I want it to do and that is monitor our home security.  Now I'll need to study this software further and have some fun with it.  When you call customer support they usually answer in about five to ten minutes.  Also they have 20 people working and they are located in Chaplain, Illinois.  Be PATIENT when you're reading the directions because they cover every possible situation imaginable.

I got these with some so called \"upgrade\" cameras which they say are 600 lines instead of the 480. I must say these must be the worste 600tvl cameras I've ever seen. The extra resolution only seems to enhance the flaws in the picture, the grains and pixelation are very well defined by these cameras. Also the image seems blurrier than the 480tvl and maybe even the 420tvl.The DVR is another case, the firmware version says june 2013 and the interface is a bit different than the ones before. The playback system is comoletely chaotic and unintuitive. You have 2 ways of playing back recordings, you can use quick playback which has 3 presets which the max is 60 seconds in the past and you can go into custom and choose date and time down to the very second. I must say though that these settings are a huge upgrade over the main record search which I am about to get into. The Main record search is total chaos, I swear. There is this chart like image that shows blue for what ever time is recorded and black for where ever there is none. Its buggy, glitchy and confusing. If that isn't bad enough sometimes you choose a date that there is recording and it shows black. It can only playback 4 cams at a time which isn't bad as most DVRs can only play 4 simultaneously. Also something that was not clear to me ever is that D1 recording is done at a drastically reduced frame rate, I would say definately below 10. CIF and half D1 are fine but just not well detailed at all.Another thing, ZMODO seriously need to work on the base for the cameras, they can easily break and even easier the shaft starts to spin in the base which is guaranteed to screw up ur camera positioning.I know it sounds like I hate them but I've seen worse and I've seen more expensive systems not be better at all so for hi 190 bucks you can't really complain just know than over time change out those effing s***ty cameras with even some $30 ones and your good to go. Also I almost forgot, I installed one of these in a bar and had to modify all 4 cam's light sensors, they refused to come out of night mode and the place was friggin bright enough. The sensors are down in a rubber tube with a tiny plastic lens on top. I removed the lens and cut off the exess rubber to completely expose the light sensor which fixed the problem.Over all as I said, you get what you pay for and to be honest I've bought dozens of these Zmodo DVRs and none have ever failed or even the cameras never fail so thats a huge bonus as I've seen the more expensive brands of superior quality flop.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "works great", "Author": "Nikki Hipps", "ReviewID": "R17OQY4U57HV0P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My elderly parents have had a lot of prowlers  so I bought this unit for them. It arrived two days ago. My son and I installed it by ourselves. I'm a 55 year old tech-challenged grandma (but I'm good with power tools) and the first camera installation was a learning curve. After that the rest went up pretty quickly. We had plugged in all the cameras to make sure they worked before we started installation. All cameras were mounted on the outside of the house so we were drilling through the outside walls then up into the attic. The cords were long enough to run from the garage to the back bedroom of a 2500 sq ft home. You will need to purchase an additional ethernet cable to run from the DVR to your router. I have not installed the computer softwear or used the iPhone application. Plan to work on that today. The IR works great, the picture quality was better than I expected. My son is quite a bit more tech savvy so he set all the motion detection parameters. The house faces a busy street so we had to adjust the motion detection areas so it wouldn't record every passing car. It was fairly easy, we got on our cell phones and I walked around until we got it just right. Once I get all the softwear installed I'll add to this review and let you know how it goes. We worked a good 6 hours on installation and another two hours fine tuning. The only thing stopping it from being 5 stars is the slightly flimsy camera base but heck, the price was right.*Update* 12/29/13 BEFORE you try to link this to your smart phone you must update the firmware to the latest version. Once we did that it was smooth sailing for accessing the cameras via the iPhones. That reset everything to the default settings so we had to go in and set the motion detection areas. This unit can be wired directly to your alarm system  (like ADT). The only problem we are having now is getting it to send us an email alert when the motion detector triggers the alarm. If we have an \"aha moment\" before talking to Customer Support tomorrow, I'll post again.*UPDATE* 12/29/13 Email issue: After double-checking all of our server settings with our ISP, Gmail and Yahoo accounts, we still weren't able to get the DVR to send us an email.  We used an Outlook.com account instead and it worked for us just fine.

Compared to my 1st system \"Lorex\" which costs me about a hundred dollar more, this system has a better DVR which to my surprise provides about 30% better picture quality (I thought picture quality depends on the cameras only). However, the 4 cameras come with the system are a lot worse than I expected. They said to be 480 TVL which is the same as the cameras of the \"Lorex\" but the display of its color is almost like comparing Black & White and HD color on TV (I have also learned from this that TVL does not necessary mean the display of color).On setting up the networking for the internet viewing, it is about the same difficulties as with \"Lorex\". I have to call for a week before getting luck to be picked up by a live technician.I would recommend considering buying this DVR only (I remember they have the DVR only) and purchase better cameras separately unless you don't mind much about the picture quality.Overall, I like this DVR since I guess you shouldn't expect good cameras come with it with the price of just about $200.", "Date": "December 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Zmodo 8 ch.!!", "Author": "Thomas W Crouse", "ReviewID": "R3RCS3NQB6LF42", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "System is very nice!!

It is a complete 4-camera surveillance system with expansion capability to substitute a larger hard drive and/or add 4 additional cameras. Everything works as advertised. I have access to the DVR from my laptop and from my Android phone. The camera quality is fair, but you can add higher quality cameras if you have that need (this entire system costs less than a single high-quality CCTV camera).The network and Internet setups are fairly technical, and if you don't have some experience with configuring routers, port forwarding, and the like, you might need to call tech support. I got through it, but it was a little bit above my expertise and it took several tries. I purchased the $3.99 Android app so that I wouldn't have to look at advertising, but there is a free app.The menus are somewhat crude yet functional. It reminds me of a rudimentary DOS application from 1988. The laptop menus are a little better, but not as complete as the system menus.You can connect to a TV monitor (BNC) and a VGA monitor (D-SUB) at the same time.

A subject needs to be within 5-10' at night in order to be recognizable. I installed two cameras to watch the gates, which cannot be seen from the house, and also mounted two up high on the house eaves I now have the added advantage of being able to see bats close up, as they either live in the attic, or are attracted to the IR beams.You need to experiment with your placement outdoors, as including too much sky will darken the lower part of the frame, and the definition is really not much after about 20' anyway, barely enough to id a face.As mentioned, good value for money.I plan to find some older thrift store videocams, and install them in key positions. Or maybe a PTZ, as it does support that. My only one real  gripe was the camera mounts, they are a cheap ball swivel design and almost  have to be locked down by a gang of rail-road workers in order to lock the camera's position so it doesn't move.I found wrapping the ball ends in plumbers' teflon tape helped this, and  I also dug out two cheap camera tripod heads from the garage and used those instead.I also covered the cable connectors in shrink-wrap when I installed, as these are quite obviously not exterior connectors, and any rain or moisture will have a quick effect.I am happy with this system and the price I paid. It's at least as good as the average CCTV you seen in convenience stores, and does all the required tricks. The convenience of just flicking a switch every time the dogs start barking, instead of walking to each end of the house, plus the added security, and cameras visible to the outside world on large poles, make this a good buy for me.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "zomodo", "Author": "stev howard", "ReviewID": "R1BD6E0SXJTDQY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Havent been able to view online.

Subtract at least three for the fact that you cannot replay video via the smartphone App. I mean, really... That's one of the main reasons to have remote viewing, is so you can check on what's been happening while you were away. A live feed is fun, but not terribly useful.So, let's see... 5-2-1+1+1+1-1+1-3=2 stars. So that's how many stars it gets.

Zmodo has given us an affordable system that actually works for its intended purpose. I ordered this set up and bought four more cameras, from a different vendor. Than bought a 1TB WD AV-GP hard drive. I removed the 500gb HDD and put it to the side, for future use as a back up. Total cost of my Zmodo system with my extra's was about $400.00 Not bad for a stand alone 8 camera CCTV set up with a 1TB hard drive. I made sure all the equipment worked before I installed it. A wired camera set up is the most reliable. It's also much harder to instal. I did not put my system online for two reasons. First, I would not own a cell phone. Second, it's too easy to hack a router. This would give anyone access to your system. My home has an alarm tied into local police department via my alarm service. If my home gets robbed. I will be able to give the police pictures which can ID the burglar. The other reason for a CLOSED system is to monitor what's going on around my home, or on the first floor. All of this is done from my master bedroom. The IR works great, at least for 30 feet to 45 feet. This less than advertised. I have set mine to record for motion detection. The 1TB hdd will record on 8 channels for at least 10 solid days. With it set for motion only I will have more than twice that time.
