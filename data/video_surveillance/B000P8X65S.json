{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Surveillance wire that works with a \"But....\"", "Author": "Andrew E", "ReviewID": "R1WVVVKP6063W2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this cable through Amazon.  This wire is typically used to connect a surveillance camera to a TV monitor or a recording device (VCR or DVR).  Each end of the wire has a plug for video and DC power.  One end of the cable has a male 2.1mm DC power connector and a male RCA type video plug.  The other end of the cable has a female DC power connector and a female BNC video plug. The seller is generous enough to include 2 conversion adapters in case you need an RCA plug on both ends (for a standard VCR or monitor) or you need a BNC connection on both ends (often seen on time-lapse security recording devices and some more expensive cameras).  The price was very reasonable for 100 feet of cable and the cable does work nicely.Now for the \"but...' part in the title of this review:I failed to look closely at the picture.  If you do look closely at the picture you will see two separate wires at each end of the cable which are joined into one single wire a few inches later.  I assumed that there would be two wires attached to each other for the entire cable length just like any standard electric cord.  If your security setup has your recording device right next to your power supply then this wire is fine and there is no problem.  However if you have your recording device is in a lock box for added security and your power supply is not located in the lock box (perhaps because of concern about excessive heat buildup from the power brick or space or electrical considerations) then you will not be able to separate the video and power wire so that you can run the power wire to a different location.  Cable that I purchased a few years ago had 2 wires on each end of the cable  that are joined a few inches later just like this wire but the wires remain separate (but attached) along the entire length of cable.  I could split the two apart with a knife for any length I chose.  In my case my power supply is 10 feet away.  In all likelihood the seller would accept a return but with the shipping cost it is probably not worth it for me.  I will now have to find a 10 foot DC power cable extension wire and run the extra wire from the lock box to the power brick.  Two distinct wires would have been so much easier and less messy.  As I said this one is my mistake.  I did not know this wire was sold in this format.  On the plus side if stealth is part of your setup then a single wire is easier to hide than a double joined wire.The seller was quick with shipping and had good communication about the purchase.", "Date": "January 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "used for cctv camera", "Author": "Gregory P.

The security system was originally packaged with 60 ft cables that had thinner rubber sheathing around the cable.  These actually were a bit thicker and seemed to be stronger than the original cables.

So I expected something similar when I bought these cables. When they arrived, I was a bit disappointed that they were thinner than the free cables I got with my CIB System. To give you an idea, these cables are thinner than the cable on my cheap computer mouse. But I figured they would be OK since the reviews were so good & that they would be easy to hide since they are so thin.Before I even unwound the cables, I plugged in a camera & power to each one to test them. The 1st cable had excessive static/interference, the 2nd cable had good video but the power did not work, the 3rd cable had no video, but the power worked & the 4th cable worked OK. I even tried each cable again with a different camera & power adapter to be sure the cables were the problem since I could not believe 3 out of 4 were bad.With 3 out of 4 cables being bad, I am just returning them & will look for something else. I would not buy these cables again even if they cost half of what I paid. The only positive thing I can say is that these cables came with BNC Female to RCA Male adapters.", "Date": "February 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Waste of money and time.

The three star rating is a direct representation of the functionality of this product; in other words, it will get you there, the only question is how. Perhaps my faux pas for being a bit too frugal (amateur Amazonian). Well, I intended to order Siamese cable for a remote video camera location. When one thinks of Siamese, two felines, similar in appearance, come to mind. Well, this cable is similar to the like said but just one cat with two heads and two tails. The heads and tails represent the terminations. In other words, this product runs both power supply and video through the same common area. The products works; however, there is roll off approaching 5Mhz causing a distorted pedestal or some technobable like that. In other words, the product is just adequate for low resolution video cameras but if you have an 800 or so line camera, please run RG6 coax. My signal was even attenuated with a 400 line camera which, as every kid in town knows, requires about 3.5 Mhz. I was gobsmacked with the poor quality of my 800 line camera until I changed over to RG6 coax. Now I can see the hair on the pimple of a flea. There is, however, good news.
