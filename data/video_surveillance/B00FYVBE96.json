My children were born way before such came about. So, I was interested in this because grandchildren now come to visit.There is the camera, monitor with belt clip, two power supplies (camera must be plugged in to use it, monitor has a battery), inadequate \"Let's Get Started!\" sheet, and a little plastic something-or-other.However, there actually is a page on the Defender site for this product and a PDF manual that can be downloaded (see that tab). Since Amazon doesn't like urls in reviews, I have posted the links in a comment.The camera unit has an on/off switch with a little green \"on\" light, along with a pairing button for use with multiple units. The camera can be adjusted up/down and left/right to be set at any desired angle.Though it will work immediately, the instructions say to charge the monitor battery for four hours before use. The monitor has an on/off button, menu button (which brings up various options that are explained in the PDF manual), volume buttons, and a microphone button for two-way communication.And, the mysterious little plastic piece can be placed on the bottom of the camera unit to elevate it. It is appropriately called the \"Camera Angle Wedge\".There is an auto-activate for the monitor when the camera unit detects sound. It's actually quite sensitive. So, the monitor does not have to stay on using up the battery, though it does work when plugged in to its charger, too.This does work quite well. The speakers are sufficient for its intended usage. The image is quite distinct on the monitor.The downside is the lack of the manual and having to guess at how to PROPERLY use it. Having to stop to go to a website and search for this unit and download a manual is ridiculous. The least they could do is provide links on their Amazon product page.The upside is how well it operates in total darkness. The picture is quite clear. I like it.

While this is a great security camera or baby monitor, which can be used in the dark, there are a few minor niggles that made me rate it 4 stars instead of five.First, it needs a power source, meaning it has to be plugged in all the time for it to work. Second, while the picture quality on the LCD is excellent, much better than I expected esp. in the dark, the LCD will not turn off if the camera is plugged in. As other reviewers have stated, the only way to turn off the LCD is to unplug the camera completely. Third issue is the directions are not very easy to understand. I would download the pdf directions directly from the Defender web site to help you install this.

We've employed the camera for another important task, and that is watching our house. If you are someone who lives on a main strip or in an urban area, this camera system can help you keep watch outside and inside for intruders. It has a really clear view in the daytime and can see all right in the dark hours, sight increases if you have a porch light or something that lights the area. You can set these up inside or out, but inside is how we've used ours. For most criminals, just a the sight of a camera in the window will deter them. You can hook up 4 different cameras and use the same monitor to toggle through the views. Hate waiting by the front door for your kid's bus to arrive? Just point the camera to the street and you can continue your daily duties - washing dishes or working - from another part of the house and see when the bus pulls up. Waiting for guests? Finish that last minute vacuuming and know the precise minute they arrive. There are so many uses for this puppy... you will want to buy cameras for all over the house!Price - I think the price for this item might be a little more than a baby monitor, but this also gives you video, so not only can you hear your baby, but also watch what they are getting in to.

This is great! The unit has an intercom, so you can talk to the person at the door...as long as you have the unit outside (see my comments below). The screen on the monitoring unit is clear and has an infrared ability for dim light. The monitor has a belt clip for convenience. The monitor controls are pretty easy to figure out.What could be improved: The camera has very little instruction with it, which is frustrating. You have to download instructions from a website to know how to operate the handheld unit, or figure it out intuitively. The camera has to be plugged in, and it doesn't say anywhere if it's weatherproof. I'm almost certain it isn't, so this means it has to be in a window inside, or in a sheltered place. I had some trouble tipping it just right to get the best view of my front door. The controls show that up to four cameras can be used with the handheld unit, but I can't find more cameras to purchase on the company website or on Amazon.This unit works well for monitoring small children and simple security needs. A friend wants to borrow it to see if she can monitor the barn animals from the house. But for serious security needs, I'm not sure this is the solution. The camera doesn't seem heavy enough to put outdoors in the places where I need a monitor.

The camera works nicely, and the ability to talk to her via the monitor has been great.  When she is across the house supposed to be in her bed and she begins saying that she needs to potty -  my sister can simply speak through the monitor to tell her, \"I'll be right there.\"  The night vision is both good and bad... when it is truly dark it works like a charm, but at nap time when the room is only dim - the night vision doesn't turn on, but it's too dark to see her.  My sister solved this by putting a postit note over the sensor at nap time so that the night vision was tricked to be on.  Over all the video and audio are great for our purpose.  The only other thing my sister brought up is that the motion sensor is very sensitive and immediately turns on the video portion of the receiver - since their newborn sleeps in their room, ever time my niece makes the slightest noise or tosses and turns, the monitor pops on and lights up their room, occasionally waking the baby.  Still it is a small price to pay to have that security.  The range is much farther than their old monitor and works well even at our parent's house which has stone walls.  We were able to put my niece down for a nap on the second floor and have 4 walls and one story between us and still watch her every move. Other than those minor flaws we recommend it highly.There is apparently an online user guide - the product did not come with one... but so far we have not needed it for anything.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy to set up, compact enough to be unobtrusive", "Author": "Eric San Juan", "ReviewID": "R3O5LLHH77TJ8I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This nice little package is generally marketed as a baby monitor, but the fact is, it's easy enough to set up and use and has decent enough features that you might be inclined to use it for ANY kind of in-home monitoring.Want to keep an eye on what's happening in another room? Want to have easy communication between your backyard workshop and the house? Want to watch your front gate for deliveries?No sweat.Set up is a breeze (though it helps if you have the manual, which you'll have to download from their website). You'll have things up and running in less than 15 minutes. Both the camera and the monitor are small enough so that they're easy to tuck into a corner, mount in an out of the way place, and generally ensure both are situated in as unobtrusive a way as possible.Battery life is only *okay*, but since the unit shuts itself off automatically and turns itself on when prompted by sound - someone knocking on the door, for instance - it will last longer than expected.The fact that it has a two-way intercom is great. You can actually use it to communicate with people at the front door or down at the front gate. And with a range of about 750 feet, it's likely to work with almost anyone's property. The signal is secure, too, so you don't need to worry about neighbors spying.The only knock I have is that the camera feels less than sturdy.

And it has a great transmitting range, I live in a big house and so far, the monitor keeps the signal everywhere I take it. The monitor comes with a stand clip on the back that allows it to be placed on a tabletop in different angles.The Defender 22500 comes with a quick setup sheet that is enough for most users, if one needs more instructions must do an online search for the manufacturer\u2019s website to find a detailed user\u2019s manual. The monitor pairs easily with the camera and the quality of the LCD tiny screen is amazing, including the sound that goes both ways. And in the dark, the night vision is great too.I didn\u2019t have any problem shutting down the monitor while in night vision. Indeed, I just did it, I had the monitor on while my child was playing, and after she went to bed and I came back to my office, I noticed that the monitor was still one, and the lights on the living room were off, so it has the night vision on. I simply pushed the button for a few seconds, and it went off. No problem.It also has an alarm for low battery too, I discovered it because I used it too long without the charger, it makes an annoying noise and the lights that are usually green change to blinking red.

There is a manual that you have to download as a .pdf file, but the initial set up was easy enough with the 'easy set up' page that walks you through it and provides the online location of the .pdf manual.We have a family member who just had surgery and is in and out of the hospital. When he is at home we have a visiting nurses coming and he is in a bedroom that is in a central location so that we can hear him or check on him easily if need be.Sometimes however situations occur where for a short period of time (like to go out and get the mail or run downstairs for laundry, ect) when we have to leave the vicinity of where he is. This device set up in the room where he is allows a much needed and important capability to do these things but still be able to monitor him and make sure things are ok.

ClearVu Technology has taken security cameras one step beyond the usual cameras and monitors with their \"invisible LED Night Vision\" camera and \"Two-Way Talk Intercom\" between the camera and the 2.4\" screen/base station. Easy setup: just plug and use in its basic setup mode. At night I have gotten even performance than their 12' claim of clear \"fixed focus\" views in a completely dark room. The invisible LEDs are great for unobtrusive nanny or baby monitor duty. It even looks out into a dark backyard on duty to snare the local cat burglar. It also has a \"power save\" mode which turns the system on at the slightest sound, because the base station has a battery. Base has a push to talk button for conversations with the \"always on\" camera mike. Removing the battery bay door is a chore: I scratched the back of the case removing it with a tool (not a big deal) but the battery case on my version cannot be put on while the '72 hour' nonstandard rechargeable lithium battery is loaded. But it also has a power supply for alternative power. It sets up a secure link capable of transmission from one end of the house or home office to the other and can net with up to 4 cameras (which I will purchase). Beyond this there is adjustable volume and aspect brightness control. With this system, ClearVu is close to making the perfect security monitor/camera system, if pan-tilt, larger screen, smartphone app, and other features were added. The system could use better \"in the box\" instructions but much is intuitive and available at the website. Highly Recommended. Four and a half AWARE Stars!

I was expecting to have to spend time fiddling with the controls to pair the units, etc. Nope. As soon as I plugged the monitor and camera into the power sockets and turned them on, the camera started broadcasting a picture and sound! What\u2019s nice is that the audio isn\u2019t only one way. Nothing has to be pushed for the microphone on the camera to work (which is nice - what sick person wants to get up and push a button to talk). But the person monitoring can push a microphone button on the monitor and talk to the ailing person: \u201cAre you OK?

The manual has one picture of it: how to plug it in and how to turn it on.  No explanation of the swivel feature, or the camera-receiver sync button.  It does not adjust for right/left or up/down (despite the neat blue arrows in the product images).  You move it by swiveling it, which corkscrews to adjust both.  I'm no remote wireless camera designer, but if it's designed to sit on a base, wouldn't a simple up/down adjustment make more sense than this?Receiver:-- Portable, with a detachable stand on the back; no mention of the stand in the manual-- Controls for volume adjustment-- Intercom button; no explanation of this feature in the manual-- Folding antenna; no explanation in the manual.There is a menu on the receiver.  Pressing it reveals only icons, no text.  The printed manual has only the title of the menu subject area, no further explanation.  You can adjust the battery use level, work a multi-camera system (not explained), adjust the receiver screen brightness, do something with \"pairing,\" and go to support.Battery: The manual mentions a battery only in discussing battery life management.  I figured out it goes into the receiver, the only indication being the three plastic ridges indicating a thumb pull.  I did that, and the little door wouldn't come off, held in place by the snapped-in stand.  No instructions on the stand and how to get it on/off; I managed to figure that out, too.  Now, if the receiver has a battery, why doesn't the camera?Intercom: yep, works just fine.  No controls on the camera end.  On the receiver end, the microphone icon is the push-to-talk button.  Sound quality is passable.Black plastic thingy: In the box there was this little black plastic thingy.  No mention of it in the manual, nor could I find out anything about it on the Defender site (more below).  It has some rubberized/nonslip footies, so apparently has an definite orientation.  There are little plastic detents on the side, so apparently it clicks into/onto something.  And that was all I could suss out.  I've got no idea what it is or does.Manual: This is not a manual.  It's the \"Let's Get Started!\" guide.  It looks slick, but isn't.  I pay attention to manuals, and this one is surprisingly poor.  It's only one page, printed in color, front and back, in English, French and Spanish.  There's no listing of what comprises this product package.  The front of the sheet is the operation, and the back is battery preservation and warranty information.  There is no listing of specs, like voltage, frequencies, system range (product page says 750'), etc.There's a URL for \"support,\" where you can \"consult\" the entire manual.  I tried, but there's no way to locate your model, nor are there any links for manuals.  I gave up after 20 minutes, no manual found.  There is no email address or phone number for immediate support (clicking on \"Customer Service\" delivers you to Support--these two are not the same thing, Defender).  Under Contact there is no phone number, only an email form, so Defender can parse and save your contact data, and answer, eventually.  There's a chat link, but you have to provide full name and email . . . again, so they can collect data and market to me (and probably sell the contact info).  No, thanks.  There is a prominently listed phone number, right at the top of the site.  No, wait, it's for sales.  This is not support.  I am always suspicious of a company that won't provide a direct and immediate way to quickly reach a person regarding their product.There is a \"Support\" area in the receiver menu.  Clicking on this gives you a single screen with the Defender logo and a URL.  Really, really weak.Operation: for $100 I didn't expect Imax-quality images, so video is okay, no big deal.  After all, this is just a little portable monitor system.  The manual doesn't even explain the camera-receiver sync button on the camera, so I pushed that and they sync'd easily, and the system worked.  Sound was unimpressive; it captures a lot of sound, but it also means you get a lot of noise through this.  Again, it's only $100, so I didn't expect much.  I moved the camera and receiver throughout my house, and had reception in all locations.  So, for my purposes, the range was fine to at least 100'.Connection: this system has no external connection.  Apparently you can add cameras to the system, four apparently, so says the product page and the unexplained icons in the receiver menu (and no info on how to do this on the Defender site, of course).  There is no way to send your wireless feed anywhere else.  There are no jacks on the receiver or camera to send this to a computer or DVR.  This is one feature I really was hoping to see.Bottom line: Given the price, this is a bargain-basement wireless monitoring system, with sound and in color.  It does that without complication or frills, and looks pretty cool.  And it does this without even the most basic provision of information to you, the buyer, of what comprises the system, its features, and how you put all of them to use.  And if you'd like this information, which I generally assume I'm purchasing when I decide to purchase any product, you'll have to become a part of the Defender marketing and databasing system.

The four stars is because you have to keep it plugged into a power source for the camera to work.  The handheld monitor comes with a battery and a clip to put on your belt.  The sound is crystal clear and when you hold the button with the speaker on it down you can talk to the person through the camera.  I originally decided to get this to put out in my barn to see what keeps killing my chickens.  I can't wait to try this out but I will have to get an extension cord so I can hook it up to the camera.  There is a setting that will turn the camera on when there is a sound.  It has great night vision and I could see the room perfectly in the dark.  As far as range from my house to the barn is roughly 100 steps and it picked up fine but if I went past 100 steps it would loose connection to the camera until I got back into range.  This would be perfect for a baby monitor because not only can you hear what is going on in the room you could soothe your baby by talking through the monitor.  I would of loved to have something like this when my children where young.  If they come out with this model with the camera hooked up to a battery that would of made this item a five star item.  I also plan on putting this in my window looking out onto my carport.  I had a prowler a year ago and now when my dog barks I get up to check outside.
