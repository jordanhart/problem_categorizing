{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great and Affordable Security System, but Not Without Flaws.", "Author": "Buckeye.117", "ReviewID": "R2QCM4FD9SUN4N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, before you actually install anything, set the system up and connect all the cameras to verify they are all functional. I read another review suggesting this action. I did as the review recommended, and it turned out one camera was bad out of the box. EZOOMTEK customer support was very courteous and helpful, and shipped a new camera to us fast and at no charge. They didn't ask us to return the defective camera, either.We installed the system running the wires through the attic. It wasn't very difficult with me in the attic pulling the wires, and my fiance feeding them up to me with the assistance of a coat hanger. The real trouble was when we were all done, and realized that we had fed 7/8 cables backwards. Yes, the ends of the cables aren't reversible. One end connects to the camera, the other to the DVR and power supply. That was something I forgot about, and it cost us an extra three hours of labor reversing all of the lines. We tied a string to one end, then pulled the cable through with the string to the other end. Then we attached the string to the correct end, and pulled the string back through the attic with the correct end of the cable attached to it. I thank my fiance for coming up with that idea so quickly. So, in short, MAKE SURE YOU PAY ATTENTION TO WHICH END OF THE CABLE YOU ARE WORKING WITH.After the install was complete, the system worked terrifically. The quality of the cameras is quite good, especially for a lower-end system. However, if you're going to use the remote viewing feature, then you're in for some work setting it up.Thankfully, Zmodo's website has a great how-to section. We still had a few issues, so we called tech support and they helped us set up our Iphones to work with the correct app. Apparently their app doesn't work with certain models (such as this one). Now, we have an issue with the DVR losing connectivity to the network, but I think we can figure it out quickly. Also, the clock changed its time for no apparent reason.We disconnect the system from our network when we are at home, as these systems (not just Zmodo's) aren't rock-solid, and are known to be hacked by advanced users, and then used to spy on the occupants. Isn't that ironic? All-in-all, this is a great system, but it's definitely not going to be a walk in the park setting it up. Take your time, and do it right.", "Date": "July 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "not sure about motion detection", "Author": "Jerry \"JB\"", "ReviewID": "R3J0GUT42MCWOC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Didn't state it on the description, but this may be a low-end product that doesn't have the capability to record only when motion is detected.
