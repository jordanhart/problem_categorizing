It was relatively easy to install.  The instructions state that the sensors HAD to be installed with the \"UP\" word facing up.  The slant on the rear bumper of her car was oriented in the opposite direction, but would fit PERFECTLY facing upside down.  I called the Tech line and the guy said to try it upside down to make sure it doesn't continuously alarm before I push the sensors into the bumper all the way in because the sensors are difficult to remove.  Using the rubber adapters that come with the sensors would make it look like an aftermarket installation (in my opinion), so I bought an 18 mm hole saw to install just the sensors without the rubber adapters (the kit comes with a 23 mm hole saw to install with the rubber adapters).  Since the headliner in my daughter's car is made of a felt-like material, the adhesive strip on the display would likely not stick very well, so I decided to place it on the rear deckliner panel instead, so I had to connect the sensors in the opposite order to indicate the correct side of the car (it was upside down).  After hooking it up, it works PERFECTLY!", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0089I09YM"}}
