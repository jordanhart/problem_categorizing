Not so great recorder", "Author": "Tobias Morgan \"Mr. Photo\"", "ReviewID": "R24EY3PNE5PE1Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's a beautiful monitorAs for the recorder not so great with my 5dmkiiiFrom my usage with the H2S converter the footage was actually better from the 5d.Also the hdmi signal out of any camera is interlaced so this is technically an interlaced signal trying to be changed to progressive. But when you move the camera in any sort of abrupt move you will see the fake progressiveness shine...  Also you are not going to get a 422 out of a 420 signal. No matter what anyone may tell you.I returned mine.  But the monitor was phenomenal and with the wave form and peaking made that much harder to return.  Buy when the cost of all the parts added up to 1700.  Not that hard to part with..  If you have a sdi cam and want a nice monitor then this may be for you but if you have hdmi then pass it by.", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Get one!", "Author": "Tim Delaney", "ReviewID": "R3U95EBC08ZFP8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use it in conjunction with a Canon 5DIII and it is great.  It is light, relatively large hi-res screen with or without overlays,  easy to set up and operate.  You need to factor in the cost of an SDI adapter and some cables if you are using an HDMI connection.  The Atomos SDI connector is compact, complete with internal battery and attaches to existing battery plate on Samurai Blade.  It has a better, larger, Hi Res  screen than most any camera.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product", "Author": "NeedApple \"Apple fan\"", "ReviewID": "R3EYVJAAIEZKR3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Using with a C100 and a H2S Connect.
