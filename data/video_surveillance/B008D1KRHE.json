For one thing the variable focus is very touchy and difficult to find the sweet spot. While mounting and adjusting the camera with the dome off, the image was decent when I got where I wanted it. Once I put the dome on, the image was blurry. Verified the dome was clean, still was blurry. At night, the IR reflects off the inside of the dome and you can not see hardly anything. I returned this camera, looking for something else. All other Swann cameras I bought, 770, 760 work great.I would not recommend buying this camera.", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Cam but..", "Author": "A.
