{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very Poor Documentation - But Great DVR", "Author": "Bill Cody", "ReviewID": "R3LO8P6DT21X27", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This may be a very fine DVR for surveillance camera but I have not been able to do the setup yet and get it working. The instructions are poorly translated from Chinese, very disorganized, not consistent, incorrect references, and confusing.Win7 computer does not automatically recognize the DVR and the router configuration instructions so confusing as to be impossible to understand how to enter. Even the software installation is a guessing game and different from the manual.Definitely not plug and play. I have an email in for Vonnic requesting help, if I get it installed I'll return with review on it's performance and operation.This a a follow-up review:I spent about 45 minutes on the phone with Vonnic Tech support after attempting all weekend to get it to work. Basically you need to disregard the included user manual (useless) and just call Vonnic. Tech support is great and got me running in no time. There are a lot of features on this DVR, maybe not many applicable for home surveillance though. The hard drive runs all the time so I don't know how long it will last. When the HD is full the DVR starts to overwrite - so you'll have lots of history. There is no on/off button on the DVR so I guess I'll just have to unplug it when I don't need it and save the disk.Update - I've had this DVR now for about 3 months and spent much time talking with tech support. Records OK but playback on a computer is very limited. Unit is meant to operate with it's own VGA monitor so configuring the DVR with provided computer software is sparse. I found the playback of recorded video time consuming and difficult. The DVR only provides 10 second playback segments up to 60 minutes. If you had to search several days of recordings it would take hours. Apparently if you buy a separate monitor and use the included mouse then playback is easier - but I can't confirm.I cannot recommend this DVR due to its computer limitations and still extremely poor owners manual. Tech support still seems to be in a learning mode as well. I downgraded it to one star.", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$179.99", "Features": "DVR Kit 8 Channel\nInstall with 500GB HDD\nH.264/240FPS FD1", "Name": "Vonnic DVR-C1108SE-500 Digital Video Recorder (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31BEOjXEfPL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BQX64LY"}}
