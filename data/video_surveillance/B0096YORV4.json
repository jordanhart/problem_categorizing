{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good net cam, mediocre software", "Author": "David K. Watson \"DKW\"", "ReviewID": "RHKKVH8EJJETG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This good basic network camera. It is compact and has good daytime and night vision picture quality. It has a microphone and a speaker can be attached for two-way communication. It has a Micro SD-Card slot that allows it to record on its own; you can also record to your hard disk or a Network Attached Storage device. It can connect to your network by ethernet and Wifi. Apple routers do not support WPS (WiFi Protected Setup), so you need to use the manual setup instructions if you use an Airport or Time Capsule. I found it no more difficult to set up on my Apple Airport-based network than any other network camera. Once you have the camera installed, a QR Code on the back of the camera an be used to to configure the client software on your iPhone or iPad.A detailed user manual, Mac-specific instructions, and Mac client software are all available on the Lorex support site.Where the LNC 104 fails to measure up is in software:- Mac OSX. The L-View Mac client software, which is in beta and must be downloaded from Lorex is bare-bones and obviously a work in progress. An update came out recently which at least gives it basic functionality.  You can now record to your hard drive, but if your want to play back your clips, you need VLC Player, a free open-source media layer. Ironically, VLC Player includes a feature not found and any version of the Lorex software: the ability to copy and convert clips to more useful formats.-iOS iPad. The basic functionality of the iPad version is OK. There are a couple or problems areas for me, however. The Lorex iPad software only works in landscape mode. This is a pet peeve of mine; the only time I ever voluntarily use my iPad in landscape mode is when I'm watching a long-form video like a movie or TV show. The Lorex software prevents your iPad from going to sleep; if you walk away from it while it is running (it does not even need to be connected to a camera), it will drain your battery. There are rudimentary playback controls for clips recorded on your iPad, but none for clips played from the camera's SD card. There is no way to export clips into a more useful format.While I was writing this review, both my iPhone 4S and iPad 3 lost the ability to connect to the cam (at the same time). The desktop client, the web, and my iPad 1 all continued to work. The iPad 3 and iPhone 4S had to be re-started to regain the ability to connect to the cam.-iOS iPhone. The iPhone app has the same functionality and issues as the iPad version except that it works in landscape or portrait mode and it needs to be connected to the cam before it overrides the system's effort to go into sleep mode and drains your battery. The iPhone version does have the ability to convert recordings made on the phone to .avi format files, but how this is done and how the resulting files can be accessed by other apps is not apparent. The user manual says only: \"...you can...also convert the video files to .avi files for sharing.\"-Windows. The Windows version is not without its share of irritants. If you want to play back a recording on the SD card, you click a button in the viewing window which opens a dialog box with a list of the daily folders. You open the folder for the appropriate day, scroll to the clip you want to view, then click Playback or double-click on the clip name. The dialog box closes and the clip plays. If you want to see the previous or next clip, you have to repeat the entire process. Depending on the the capacity of your SD-Card, you can have dozens or even hundreds of clips on the card. The Windows version now has the ability to record clips to your hard disk. Like the Mac version, you must download and install VLC Player in order to view any you have recorded.-Web Interface. As you might expect, the web interface gives you the most information about the cam settings. To display video in the web interface, Internet Explorer is required because an Active-X control is used. This means you cannot view the cam image via the web page at all on a Mac or if you use Firefox or another non-MSIE browser in Windows. However, even with Internet Explorer and the Lorex Active-X control installed and enabled, all I ever got was a black frame with \"Locating...\" in the middle of it.I found part of the web interface to be unnecessarily confusing and perhaps a little flaky. To me scheduling basically means creating a list of things to be done at a specific day and time. This task is available under Scheduling, but they have also lumped a bunch of behavior controls under the same heading. To me, it makes more sense to have the set-ups for alarms, notifications, and recording criteria under one heading and setting the days and times to do those things under a separate header. I understand the need for complex scheduling in security cams and I've done it on other systems, but there should also be a \"Use the settings I've specified 24 hours a day, 7 days a week\" check box to simplify the process when appropriate.I was able to set up email notification and motion activation. The email notifications include a still frame as a jpeg file. However, it seems like anytime I made a change in the settings, I ended up starting from scratch. Accessing the web interface from Safari on a Mac, I was able to delete but not download clips from the SD card. Firefox on the Mac could see the clips folders, but none of their contents. Using MSIE in Windows, I was able to delete and download the files and view the downloaded files using VLC Player.I think this is a great network cam if all you need to do is set up a camera and monitor the situation in real time. You can accomplish that in iOS, Windows, and even the Mac beta version.  However, I find the process for creating, viewing, organizing, editing, and exporting clips to be cumbersome at best. If you do not know the exact date and time a clip may have been recorded, finding the pertinent clip could be very time-consuming. I also think the process for setting camera features and scheduling could be more intuitive.", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Slick", "Author": "Scott Bright \"scottypotty\"", "ReviewID": "R3OFCG7K7BI5DA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was able to get this camera working with no trouble at all.

In this day and age, my companies have online chat for questions but not Lorex.  So, I emailed them a question on how to hook up the two way audio on this and I got a ticket number.  After another day i got back another email saying it was sent to tech support and someone would contact me and here's ANOTHER ticket number.  I waited another day and heard from no one so i called them.  Well, I waited on hold twenty minutes to get to the first person who gave me ANOTHER ticket number and put me back on hold for another 15 minutes to get me to a tech support person that couldn't answer the questions without the camera number. I told him i didn't have another 35 minutes to sit on hold and he told me to call a certain number when i got home to go right to tech support.  So i came home and started the process over again and waited twenty minutes on hold to get to a person who did nothing more than give me ANOTHER  ticket number and put me back on hold again.  At the current time i'm on hold and have been for 20 more minutes. Who does this company think they are making the simplest enquiry into a process like this???I am going to call Amazon and see if i can return this.  I do not want to do business with Lorex.

MSakamoto \"boy clothes\"", "ReviewID": "RNLPRR83XXZN0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Summary: Small device that came with few instructions and no Mac software in the box, but in the end it works well and does what it says - with some minor effort.What's in the box:The Lorex LNC104 comes with a folded, color instruction sheet that is written for PCs, a CD that has the PC software and a URL for the Mac software, ethernet cable, USB cable and a power supply brick (white w/white cable to match the device). I was not initially impressed with the PC instruction booklet, but I did find that combining it with the online instructions for the Mac at the Lorex website was sufficient for me to sort things out.Installation:The software is pretty crude by today's standards. You have to know to \"right-click\" on certain portions of the display to make settings, connect to the camera for setup, etc. Also, the look is \"industrial\" at best. No eye candy here - it looks like it came from the Windows 2000 era at best. I mention this, because you MUST have the instructions handy or you will be very, very unlikely to figure the installation or use out yourself in any reasonable amount of time. It is strange that the interface would not include more obvious buttons, tabs or menu items to set up and operate the cameras, but it doesn't. That said, the software does work, it only crashed on me once.You MUST have an ethernet connection initially or it is unlikely that you will be able to connect to the camera. It is apparently possible to connect wirelessly if you have a router that has a WPS broadcast button, which allows wireless password sync with the camera, but I've not seen very many of those. In fact, the only one I ever had was a proprietary T-Mobile / D-link router for the old T-Mobile \"hotspot at home\" feature on the their older wifi phones. Perhaps there are more, but my Apple AEB's don't have the button, so I had to wire in the camera to start with and then, using one of those \"right-click\" instructions mentioned before, configure the device using the Lorex web configure tool. Now, interestingly, this web configure tool seems a lot nicer than the downloaded software. Almost as if a different team wrote it - one from this decade. Hate to sound so snide, but I'm just not used to having to stay slaved to printed instructions. There are no setup \"wizards\" here. It's all about \"simon says\" and if you get one wrong, it doesn't work. For instance, when I attempted to set up wireless operation, I used the printed instructions and got to the point that the web based setup tool said to pull the ethernet connection to enable wireless operation. The printed instruction didn't say to do this until I ran one test with the wired AND wireless connection in place. Turns out the hardcopy was right.After going through all the wired, then wireless setup, I decided to download the Ping application for my iPhone 4S. It is, as to be expected by this time, not very slick looking, but it works. Setup was a lot easier than the initial setup.Use:Once the setup is done, the use is pretty simple. The camera is a VGA resolution device, so the pictures are far from HD. That said, daylight pics are decent. The featured low light images are pretty gunky looking, but usable so far. I did not carry out extensive testing on that part - it's supposed to have an IR illuminator as well as a sensitive camera,One issue is that although the box claims you can have conversations with another person using this device as it has a small mic and a speaker, this feature is not too useful iMHO. I have pretty great internet service and have no issue using VOIP from Skype, Ooma, GoToMeeting, etc. With the Lorex, the time lag for sound is about 2-3 seconds. This makes communication really tough. I think the best use for the sound capability is Mic only to listen for issues around the camera.Why I removed one star:1. No Mac instructions in the box. Although the PC instructions were helpful when used with the online Mac info, this is not a huge deal and they should have taken care of it. These are small files and small apps. It is almost as if they had a shipment deadline and were catching up on the Mac portion while the PC stuff was being manufactured and shipped. This puts the burden of consolidating documentation and software on me, the customer.2. Time lag. A couple seconds is a long time for a potentially real-time device. This is 1.5 seconds longer than I would have thought.3. The awkward back and forth setup between wired and wireless communication. I have to believe this could have been made easier. You usually don't have to do this with other wireless wifi devices.4. Crude software. Like I said, it works, but it looks like a home hobby project and you must read the instructions to use it. This is below par for both Mac and PC nowadays. But, to repeat, it does work, which is why I don't mark it down more.Trick features:Being able to access the video stream from Mac, PC, Android and iPhone is great. Being able to do this with up to 20 (I only tested 2) devices at once is cool.During handheld setup, you can input the device info to your phone via a QR code on the back of the camera. The implementation was rough (no surprise) but worked well enough.Trick feature I didn't yet test:Remote access via wif at Starbucks. If I get to this, I will update the review. Since I have cable, with DHCP addressing and a NAT in the path, I don't see how I will be able to access the device out of the home as is promised on the box, but we'll see. I suspect this can only be accomplished if i get a static address for my home (not going to happen - $$$).Conclusion:I guess I would recommend this to a friend if they found it at the right price. IMHO, this would be under a hundred. No great shopping experience here, it just feels like it should be in that price range to represent good value. The best way I can describe this device is, it's a B- experience. That is, it could have been an A grade play, but the software is just good enough to work, but not good enough to be happy about - not by some margin. All the tested features worked and the device appears to be well made for indoor use. This includes a nice metal pivot arm instead of the expected cheap plastic hardware. If you have the patience and aptitude for a no-wizard setup experience, and the price is right, go for it.", "Date": "April 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Didn't do what it was supposed to do.", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "R3AZS019YD4TGG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The cameras never did the ping as it stated.

I hope you are a network engineer if you buy this camera.UPDATE: After using this device for a few weeks, I have finally figured out how most everything works.  It's a decent piece of hardware but, like others have said, the software needs A LOT MORE WORK.Finally a few words about TECHNICAL SUPPORT.  IT IS HORRIBLE.  For example, I opened a ticket to report a specific bug that I found in the \"Email/FTP Alarm Settings Setup\" menu.  Instead of accepting the bug report and saying they would investigate- they assume I couldn't possibly know what I am doing and MUST call their customer support desk for assistance.

The camera is used for security in my vacation home.The problem I ran into was getting very frequent e-mail notification at certain times of the day. The notifications were motion activated. What I finally figured out, with very little assistance from Lorex, was that rooms that have shadows from sunlight activate the motion sensor. I changed the notification setting to PIR which senses body heat. I no longer get the false alarms and when I tested it, notifications were sent to my Android phone and computer showing me entering the room.  The software is easy to view and I can view my home at any time of the day or night. You can also view video recorded on the SD card.

But overall the software for all the systems I tried is pretty crappy and buggy; and the features I bought it for are nonexistent and/or very well hidden.I bought this camera for monitoring my pets, who apparently bark a lot when I'm not home. So naturally, I wanted a web camera that could record when triggered by sound, and preferably alert me remotely. In fact, I found this particular model by searching for something like \"pet monitoring audio trigger\", which led me to the \"Pet Monitoring Solutions\" page on Lorex's website. Although that page doesn't list the model number, the page behind the \"view details\" link on the bottom clearly lists the camera as LNC104.The \"Pet Monitoring\" page makes lots of appealing claims, including:\"you can set the system to record automatically whenever your pet makes a sound with the audio trigger function\"and\"The SD compatible IP camera can store up to 16GB worth of footage\" (and also mentions uploading said footage to social media sites)After fiddling with the camera and puzzling out the instructions for a few hours, I finally found an audio trigger function. However, bizarrely, it is only available on mobile devices, and only for triggering push notifications, not to start recording or send email alerts or any of the other kinds of alerts that are available for motion detection. Luckily for me, I was going to use it on my Android tablet, anyway. After another hour or so of deleting and re-adding the camera to the list (and watching it spontaneously change its own settings), I actually got the push notifications to work! on a local network. sometimes. with a delay of a few seconds. So if the dogs only bark once or twice, by the time I see the notification and \"tune in\", it'll be all over and I will get no information.OK, fine - so maybe I can just use the sound notification to alert me to events, and record using movement triggers, ont the 16GB of space the camera is supposed to have? Not so fast. This camera does not, in fact, have any built-in space. It does have a micro SD slot that can take up to a 32G card. So I guess now I have to find or by a microSD card. and then manually compare my sound-triggered observations with the timestamps on the motion-triggered recording. Yay.Other annoyances:-extremely unintuitive menu design; setting up recording schedules involves going to at least two separate menu \"families\", one to schedule the times in question and a separate one to say what you want to do during these times. The various trigger options are spread out in different, inconsistent menus, also depending on what it is you want to use the trigger for. \"alarm\" can either mean push notification or making the speakers(\"sold separately\") attached to the camera itself make noise.-proprietary video format (?) the software for running the cameras comes with a separate player that you need to play the videos. the format is .sdb, and a quick googling does not show it as a widely used video format. I haven't looked into it too much though. This seems to preclude the advertised \"uploading to social media\"-inconsistencies between manual and software, for example: manual says that 1 is lowest and 10 is highest sensitivity; android software says the opposite. Still not sure which one is right - I ended up just setting it to 5.Conclusion:should have just downloaded the open-source iSpy softaware and used it with my webcam.", "Date": "February 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad Software; Terrible Overseas support", "Author": "Kevin", "ReviewID": "RNS9BILI2Z7K", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The camera works - but when you ned to make configuration changes - or upgrade, good luck.The Support (India) takes forever - both email and phone); is not very helpful.The Mac software is so bare bones it is still a Beta.The iPad software was better; but doesn't allow you to perform all of the required administration.Support counts - and when you need it, you'll be sorry you bought this camera.", "Date": "April 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware", "Author": "jonrosss", "ReviewID": "R22X455FKU0HVQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Buyers should know up front that this camera is wireless ONLY IF your router has a WPS button.

It goes into a never ending \"Locating...\" state where it thinks it is looking for the camera.The computer software is no better. Viewing recorded video is an absolute nightmare and is done in a separate program from the live video for some reason. The program also does not use Windows standard windows so you can't use the nice Win 7 \"snap\" feature or any other Windows defaults.Would I buy this camera again? Yeah.

BTW, this camera seems much better intelligence... [...]I just had it for over 2 days and here's my feedback on this. I have owned Trendnet, Foscam 8910, and others. I may return it because of the HUNDREDS of 4MB files it records when I turn on motion detection. Yes, HUNDREDS of tiny 10 second length files you have to wade through for a SINGLE DAY of recordings. Yes, it's that stupid. I got it for $85 on Amazon promo.SetupThis is probably one of the easiest to set up. I installed the Android software I found on Google Marketplace and it found the cameras quickly and easily. Harder for me was figuring how to get to admin using web browser. Turns out username is admin and no password.Once you are running on the phone, it also requires password. Default is lorex.What I liked- Installation was simple. I used web browser and just point to IP of camera. Username is admin and blank password. If you need to find IP address of camera on your network, use arpspyx software on Mac to find what ports are being used and just try a few.- Great long USB cable that connects to a power adapter. So if you have usb devices nearby, you can just plug it into the USB port.- Images were sharper than my Foscam FI8910W. Not as smooth in motion though.- Smaller and lot lighter than my Foscam FI8910W- Mounting was simple and could pretty much adjust any way I like- Night vision looked better than my Foscam FI8910W.- You could record video directly to NAS drive. (but see my CONS below)- You could directly record to micro SD video card- You could turn off all the lights on device- You could access almost all the functions of camera using the mobile app- I did not try the included software on the CD. I just installed their software on Android and use the web browser admin to set it up.- I can remotely access it also using 3rd party android video cam software like IP Cam Pro through port 80- The power plug adapter is standard size (unlike the tiny thin one on the Foscam)What I did not like- You CANNOT record audio in recordings. Which is just so dumb... why would they not include it?- The video recordings are weird CRF format and can only be played via its mobile app or VLC once you download file to your local computer- The video recordings are kind of ridiculous in way files are saved. I did motion detection and it would record SEVERAL HUNDRED small video files that were 10-20 seconds each. Stupidest thing I have ever seen. So basically you have to wade through several hundred files to find something. Each one is named according to the date and time. And you'll basically have to go through several hundred video files if you used motion detection. There's nothing like other intelligent cameras that allow you to put 30 seconds before and after. Each file is like 4M each so compression is good. It's plain STUPID they would make hundreds of files of 10 seconds each. I guess the only other option is disable motion detection and use full day. Because software is too stupid to not allow user to add 30 seconds before and after.- Video recordings are somewhat pixelated and play very slow on my android Galaxy S2. It plays like it's in slow motion. Plays fine on VLC. Video is better than Foscam FI8910W.- Videos has NO SOUND and you cannot enable it- No way to tilt or pan the camera- The camera lens is less wide angle than the Foscam. So you will be able to see less of the room. Maybe 15% less width.I think it's better than the Foscam in terms of quality but it really is stupid in that it cannot record audio and playback on android devices suck and the motion detection recording is a joke. I kid you not. HUNDREDS of 4MB files of 10-15 seconds and each after the other. So one would be 9:00-9:01 and another is 9:02-9:03 and 9:04 - 9:05 and so on and so on. It's the dumbest recording algorithm I have ever seen on such a device. How hard is this? Motion, record. Wait 30 seconds. More motion? Keep recording to same file. No more motion after 30 seconds?

Its strengths are that it sets up easily and provides great functionality, but its main weakness is that you have to use the Lorex software to conveniently access live or recorded feeds.I successfully configured the device using the Lorex Ping app for Android, with little difficulty. It needs to be configured via a wired network (unless you use WPS, which I didn't test; I have WPS disabled due to security concerns); once you've told it about your wireless network's essentials (e.g. SSID and passphrase), you can disconnect it from the wired network and access it wirelessly (so that all you need to provide to the installed location is power rather than power plus network cable). More on this in a bit.In addition to viewing live video on your Android, Apple, or Microsoft Windows device, you can also save or email snapshots whenever the device detects movement. You can configure the amount of time between snapshots, as well as the sensitivity to movement. I tried one second between snapshots with the default sensitivity, and the device reliably saved images via FTP to my network file server. Both day and night images were very good; the night images are illuminated by IR LED's on the unit.I was also pleasantly surprised to see that although the Lorex Web site indicates the Ping series of cameras does not support network-attached storage, the option to save to NAS was indeed available in the web camera configurator. (A camera firmware update was offered when I installed the camera; I suspect this update added the NAS function.) The NAS needs to support SMB (i.e. Windows server or Samba server) so check that before trying it. I was able to configure a Samba share and have the camera record video to it. However, I wasn't very pleased that the files are saved as five-minute clips that are not very friendly to view. Not only do you have to find the right clip in the first place (perhaps via snapshots, which are timestamped), but also the files, which are .crf (raw MPEG-2 video streams), are hard to open and view. The camera also writes a .rfd file for each five-minute clip, and a \".list\" file in the root directory. Both these are binaries and are most likely proprietary to the camera system. So to review clips, you're basically locked into the Lorex software.I expect cameras such as this to allow you to view live video via a Web browser on any platform on my local network. Unfortunately this camera does not live up to this rather easy-to-meet standard. In order to view live video via a Web browser, you must install an ActiveX control, which means you need to be on the Windows platform. Linux users like me are locked out. (Also, the Lorex software does not work \"out of the box\" with Wine, the Linux program that lets you run well-behaved Windows programs in Linux. I did not try workarounds though. I also noted that the Wine applications database [...] has nothing related to Lorex.)Regarding installation, if you prefer a wired network cable, you might be interested in powering the camera via power over Ethernet (PoE). Although this device does not directly support PoE, there are external adapters available; this is one I just purchased for work that seems to work well: TP-Link PoE Adapter Kit (TL-PoE200) The disadvantage of such a device is the extra box on each end. You could also try powerline networking; multiple such products are available but they're a little expensive and you still have extra equipment at each end (probably less at the head end though). The bottom line is, with a little creativity you can put this camera in a wide variety of environments. But given the fact that you're locked into the Lorex software to make good use of the video, your time and effort might be better spent with another camera.", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice and easy set up.", "Author": "Emil Mariani \"eman1\"", "ReviewID": "R2MVYPCLRUYLFF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Set up for iPhone, iPad and computer is easy.

Then downloaded the Lorex Ping app from Google Play to my android tablet. When the camera arrived I took it out of the box, connected the power, and pressed the WPS button on my wireless router.

This is true regardless of what IP camera you buy, since without good wireless signals none of them can talk to the router.To test this, you can take a laptop or a ipad/tablet and walk around your house. Watch the signal strength bar of the wifi.  Where ever the signal is weak, an IP camera won't work very well.  When I placed it in weak-coverage areas it constantly rebooted to search for a better signal and couldn't maintain a connection.

The good news is that I have achieved everything that I wanted to achieve at a really cheap price.  I use them for live real-time security monitoring at a small business, which my wife owns that was robbed once. To do this you need to be able to hear really well because you are not always watching the monitors. The mics on these cameras work really well. Because of the flat camera size without the protruding lense, I was able to install them inside the wall behind an apparatus used as a disguise. You also have to turn off the camera lights in order for them to not be noticed, which you can do.  I also wanted to be able to talk to an intruder since that gives the best chance of altering his behavior before the police arrive. The two-way communication works fine over android, iphone and PC. So well that I use it all the time like a walky-talky to chat with my wife. The quality of the video is very good, and the continuous recording to the memory card inserted in the camera also works really well. With it, you can go back and view anything that you may have missed at any time. You can also selectively record to the PC or phones that you are monitoring with, in case you are worried that someone may steal the cameras and take them with them. This has always worked fine for me when I used it.Now for the not so good news. The software is moderately to annoyingly glitchey. At first, the central Lorex upload/streaming site would randomly confuse which of my two cameras I was getting. Often both leads were sending from the same camera, and you had to re-connect the camera with only a slight chance of this correctly the problem. This made the cameras almost worthless, and customer support was brain dead when it came to understanding what was going on.  Fortunately, this problem finally went away, and it works now without mixing up the cameras at all.  However my experience with customer support is that you cannot count on customer support to resolve problems for you. Therefore, you will need to be able to resolve issues yourself.  Other than the initial bug that mixed up my two cameras, if you have moderate skills working with computers and network equipment and software you can make it work.

I found the Lorex IP camera and decided to give it a shot.  When it arrived I sat down and plugged it into my hub and went to work on setting it up.  I had a problem early on but the problem was not with the camera it was with me.  I use MAC authentication and the camera actually has two MAC addresses.  You are only made aware of one MAC address and that is for the wired connection.  You will have to disable your MAC authentication on your modem briefly to perform the WiFi test.  Once you have a successful WiFi test you can go to the information tab and get the WiFi MAC address and add that to your allow list and enable your MAC authentication again.  FYI, you will not find a WiFi MAC address until you have a successful WiFi test.This camera actually works great for the most part.  I am not impressed with the motion detection however.  I suspect the problem with the motion detection might be how I am using my camera.  I have it mounted in my window looking out monitoring the approach to my door.  The camera will not detect a person but will detect the change in light.  I suspect the fact that I am trying to use the motion sensor through glass is the problem.  Infrared does not always play well with glass.  I have not tried testing it any other way because motion sensing was not all that important to me.  During my testing the camera was set up to email me and it did a great job at doing that at dawn when the sun started to come up and at dusk when the sun went down and at night when the headlights of a passing car were detected.  This was with both PIR and motion activated.  The onboard IR light is worthless if you are mounting this camera to look out a window.  All it will do is light up the glass nice and bright and not allow you to see anything.  This was not a surprise at all and I did not expect it to work through the glass.  This camera is nice but it cannot perform magic.  If you are using this monitor spaces inside a building I suspect this camera and its PIR & motion sensing will make you very happy.I also have a NAS and the camera does connect to it and I have 7 days worth a video recording and the video is overwritten after 7 days.  I am also using a SanDisk 32GB Micro SD card for recording video and that works great as well.  I was so pleased with this camera that I ended up getting a total of 7 cameras.  After getting all 7 of them set up I did have some stability problems that I needed to work through.  The cameras were losing connection and it was very frustrating.  The solution was to allow the cameras to automatically handle resolution and frame rate.  If I remember correctly that is the default setting but I had changed that on all of them.  Once I did that all the cameras stayed connected.  I was able to run 6 cameras at a higher resolution and frame rate with no problems but adding the 7th camera pushed my WiFi over the edge.  The more cameras you add the slower the frame will be.The Lorex Ping android app also works great so I am able to check all seven cameras from work with ease. I have one camera that has the microphone activated and I am able to listen to what is going on using this app.  I have not played with the speaker and alarm option and do not plan to so I have nothing to say about that.All in all this is a great little camera that is really easy and fast to set up and not all that expensive.

Fleming", "ReviewID": "RV11BG1ZUOV7L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I started out with one camera that I bought at Lowe's for about $120.  I liked it and bought one on Amazon for $90, then bought two more, so I now have four, which all fit together nicely integrated on my computer screen.The good points about these cameras:  For the price especially, they give good quality color video, excellent night infrared video in little to no light conditions.  The audio is OK.  It can be two-way audio if you hook up any kind of cheap speaker to a camera.  However, it is not duplex...you can either talk or listen but not both at the same time.  Once initialized (but see below), the wifi function works very well and you only have the one power wire going to an outlet.  Once set up, I have four videos on my computer screen at once, and only have to double click on any one to bring it up full screen.  You can set the cameras to record continuously, at certain user-defined hours, or motion-activated.  I do the latter.  To do this automatic recording, you need to have a micro-SD card in the camera.  You can then access the video remotely on a computer.  (See below).  You can also start/stop recording remotely on a computer at any time and this is read by the supplied L-Play software.  Most of what you will be doing on the computer and what was described above is managed through the supplied L-View software.  Not sure why they couldn't be integrated.The negatives:  First of all, it can be a hassle to set up.  I set up four cameras at three different points in time and it still didn't go entirely smoothly the fourth time.  You just sort of keep trying to go through their confusing instructions and finally when you accidently do the right thing, it works.  However, once I had each camera set up, they have continued to work just fine.The software leaves a little to be desired.  If you just want to have a visual of what the camera is seeing, there's no problem.  Also, if you want, the camera will e-mail you each time it's tripped by the motion detector if you want it to.  Then you can access remotely say, on your smart phone, and see who's stealing your stuff.  This seems to works OK.  However, if you want to access the stored video on your card, it's a little cumbersome.  It's easy enough to access the data on the card.  However, it is stored in folders according to date and you get a list of all the recorded video arranged chronologically by time.  When you double-click on a file the video does, indeed, pop up and plays.  However there are no controls to fast-forward, rewind, etc. Then, when the video ends, you get a blank screen and have to repeat the whole sequence of opening the recorded video, opening the correct folder and then hope you remember the ID of the last video so you can play the next one if that's what you want to do.  We're trying to catch our dogs peeing in the kitchen.  If you catch them while they're doing it, fine.  But if you discover a puddle and want to go back and identify the culprit, it's a very tedious process and it needn't be.  You can also record on demand to your computer (not the SD card) and view it on L-Play.  I have found this to be very hit and miss, kind of useless, and when I have managed to actually bring up a file, there are some controls for fast forward but basically useless.  I'm thinking that I might have had a little more luck visualizing SD card contents by removing the card from the camera and placing it in the computer but that gets old.Soooo.....I would have given this five stars but the software holds it back.  Still, it is a great camera, especially for the money.  If you want to keep any eye on your house from anywhere in the world, be warned of an intrusion anywhere in the world, it does that.  If there's a past event such as a breakin or someone doing something they shouldn't, you will be able to dig it out of the SD card but it's cumbersome.  One very good thing is if you're low on cash, you can still obtain most of this protection with just one camera, as I did until a short time ago.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not bad for the price, could be better...", "Author": "YT \"Techie\"", "ReviewID": "R2WS2C8ZUL0A2S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Disclaimer: Self proclaimed tech, as an applications developer for multiple platforms you would think setting up 3 network cameras is as easy as 1,2,3... you would be wrong. Granted my network setup at home is complex than most typical user out there but still getting the cameras working nice with my routers was a hassle.Bought these for great price for the type and quality of the cameras did not need to splurge on HD just yet. Needed an easy and simple solution to monitor babysitter for my 5 year old.Current network and setup at the time of initial setup.Netgear WNDR4000 with MAC restriction setup, no WEP or encryption (there was a reason for this setup, would be very boring and lengthy explanation). SSID was basically open as long as I knew the MAC address and given it access via the routers setup.10PM on a Saturday, kids are in bed and now have alone time to setup some security cameras, yeah!1st clue: the device have a sticker on the back, by FCC requirements must include the MAC address of the said network equipment utilized by the user. Which they do, but here is the rub, only the LAN adapter's MAC address is provided on the sticker. Assuming that they net the LAN to their WiFi adapter this is not a big deal. Assumption wrong.2nd clue: the device claims it has WPS (WiFi Protected Setup) capabilities. My WNDR4000 has WPS so lets give it a go right. The device and the router were literally one(1) foot away from each other in the same room, no obstruction. The two could not pair what so ever.3rd clue: The manual advertises their supper cool iOS app on the AppStore that you can use to setup the device and be done with all the nonsense of networking and such. Pull out my iPhone5 with iOS7 on it, and downloaded the app. Added the device using QR code on the back of the device. FYI all it does is fills in the ID of the device which is also on the back sticker. After a few tries and back and forth with the settings cannot locate the camera. At this point I start questioning my understanding of technology. Am I that old that I no longer can setup a simple IP device, do I a dare call customer service and wait for some guy to tell me I'm holding it wrong? No, I refuse to give up.Status Update: 2AM and still can't setup one camera via any WiFi possible solution, let alone 2 more.4th clue: after exhausting all WiFi setup methods, LAN must work, or else. And by gosh it does. But I bough a wireless, capable device(s). key word: WiFi. Instructions point me to installing their L-View software which in turn points me to web interface of the device's settings, finally getting somewhere. Note under info section it still shows only the LAN MAC address. not very useful to me as I need the WiFi adapters MAC address to add it to the Access List. So what to do at this point? I disable the MAC restrictions on my router and my SSID is now exposed to any device to join if they desire. I figured who will be hacking me at 3AM right. So under network setting in the web interface of the device I selected \"None\" for security mode under the sub section for WiFi settings. Run the WiFi test as the option after saving all setting. \"Test failed\"To make the long story short, I had to enable WPA(2)-PSK with AES encryption only then my cameras started to join my network and functioning. At this point web interface and my router are reporting the WiFi MAC address. Why not just give it to me in the first place!What should have taken no more then 2 min or under 1 if you watch the YouTube guide of setting this camera up. it took me well over 6h to figure out the correct settings that would work for me to utilize these devices. Note: WPS still did not work. iOS app now recognizes the devices, poor layout of the app and crashes most of the time. I like the layout of the iPad app better but still needs work. Why not have a universal binary?Update: Had the cameras running for over a month now, seem to be stable produce mediocre night video quality. One camera has very sharp clear night view and the other 2 have very blurry night view. not sure why. Since setup I've switch my router to Netgear R6300 to get a better range. Also setup the recording function to Network Attached Storage (NAS). note: no where in the manual or website does its state they support it nor instructions on how to configure it.

No notice of update, I had pretty much given up on it.  But it does work again, and works well.  I guess I'd say good product, terrible customer service, be careful of updates.Cameras worked well, day and night until Oct 31 update to mobile app. After a full hour plus wait for tech support we uninstalled update only to find no compatible app left to install, then we got disconnected.  After another hour and 15 minutes wait in the queue another tech said there wasn't any more he could do.  I protested and he agreed to bump it up to a supervisor.  When I asked if I'd have to wait again, he said no, however it was another 20 min. wait.  I was finally connected to a tech that spoke clear, unaccented English. After being put on hold a couple of more times, total about another 15+ min, this tech confirmed that the Oct 31 mobile app was not compatible with first generation Google nexus 7, one of the best selling tablets to date!  No idea when a fix will arrive, couldn't say a week or a month, no assurance that they would have a fix or make the old updated app available by a few weeks or anything like that.  He did spend a good deal of time trying to find an old version and helping me to dload it.  However it was much older than the one that was updated and didn't work.  So, all that could be said is that they are aware of it and working on it.  It seems strange that they can't find the previous version and post it while they spend an indeterminate time on a fix.Lessons learned:1.Lorex tech support takes LONG to get through and no way to avoid queue when disconnected.  No, though they ask for your phone#, they won't call you back.2. Lorex, while making a great little security/monitoring camera, fails to meet reasonable expectations for software support.3. The hardware has a 1 year warranty for tech support, clear and fair, however, if the software stops working, it's questionable whether the cameras will be more than a mock appliance.

The setup is quick and easy and, even if you don't have a router that supports WPS, you still can connect. It's a bit more complicated, but doable.  You can connect from a PC, an iPhone, iPad & Android device.  If you have a Mac there are instructions on the Lorex Technology site.Setting up a camera may seem daunting to some, but it's really quite simple, especially with the step-by-step instructions and visuals included in the Quick Start Guide.  Lorex has also provided a video (both on Amazon and their website) I might recommend glancing at before starting.  For those who want to look at multiple locations either at home or away, this setup is expandable to four additional cameras.  The flexibility is awesome ... you can use it from everything to a security device, a baby monitor, elder monitor, or a cat/dog-cam.  If you have an iPad, provided you add additional cameras, you can see up to four locations on one screen.WHAT'S IN THE BOX:*  Wireless Network Camera*  Camera bracket (mounting kit)*  Ethernet cable*  Power adapter*  Quick Start Guide*  Software/documentation CDSPECS:*  iOS, Android, PC and Mac compatible*  Wi-Fi & wired internet connectivity*  Easy connection to Wi-Fi networks with WPS (you still can connect if your router does not support WPS)*  Night vision up to 30ft with single high-power IR LED*  microSD recording & playback supported*  Dual motion detection:  PIR & video*  Sound activated alerts*  Push notification of events and email alerts with snap shot attachment*  Bandwidth-efficient VGA (640 x 480) resolutionH.264 video compression*  Supports up to 20 simultaneous users*  Two-way audio supported*  Flexible indoor mounting (counter, wall, ceiling)*  Expandable up to 4 camerasThis is a versatile, expandable wireless network camera with amazing capabilities.

The camera works flawlessly and has many more features than I had expected. After set up on the wireless mode, the camera can be put anywhere in the house and routes through my Apple Extreme router. Overall, it probably took me less than 5min to set up the camera and begin to get familiar with it. Since then I've played around with other features and am discovering more of it's capabilities. Besides the wireless mode, another feature that I've tried is remote viewing from anywhere there is the internet (hence almost everywhere in the world). I also bought a Micro-SD card (highly recommended) for the camera and like the ability of the camera to record pics and videos onto the card either motion activated (loads of choices there also) or at regular intervals. These pics can also be remotely viewed. I also like the email feature that emails pics (again in my case motion activated) to an email account, again with loads of choices regarding how many, how many frames per second, etc. so as to not get thousands of pics on your email (I set up a gmail account specifically for this purpose; user manual gives specific directions for setting it up so it will work, and it did the first time. So far these are the features that I've set up; and another awesome thing is you can use these features simultaneously, e.g., have it record on the micro-SD card and email, etc. The user guide has great directions for setting up this camera, including suggestions about what you might want to do when just starting out and what is more advanced.

I followed the instructions for setting it up through the router's ethernet connection but the software's autosearch function did not identify this camera.- the camera requires an AC adapter attached in order for it to operate which makes it less practical to mount on locations where a power outlet is not accessible- the software is not entirely user friendly.

One of the original three had a problem but the other two worked so well that I went ahead with ordering two more.  Had I known what lay ahead in resolving the problem with the defective one I might have thought twice about doing so.I have worked with computers and related technology for 40+ years.  In that time, I have been involved in over 100 significant customer service events.  I would rank my dealings with Lorex in the bottom quartile.In summary,- I called Lorex.  Someone took my number and promised a return call.  It never came.- I submitted an online request for support.  In response I received a ticket number.  Two days later I received a message that the matter was being forwarded to tech support who would issue me a new ticket number.  No new ticket number was issued, even after I sent a follow-up message noting that I had not received it.- After waiting a week, I called Lorex again and hung in there until I could actually talk with someone.  I'm not sure why I was required to fill out the \"mandatory\" warranty before my prior call because I was given the opportunity to provide a lot of the same information again.  In fact, when I offered to give him the warranty number he did not want it.  Although long period on hold, then I spoke with a technician.  I was given the opportunity to provide a lot of the same information again.  After a frustrating conversation caused me to silently question the acumen of the \"technician\" I was told that I would have to ship the unit back.  There was the mention of a hot return since I was within 30 days of purchase.- The RMA form arrived by e-mail.  I was given the opportunity to explain the provide a lot of the same information again.- The RMA approval has now arrived.  It appears the hot return option was a canard.

Secondly, to figure out where the dog keeps getting out of the back yard and thirdly, do keep in the play room to resolve disputes between two little girls who always claim \"it was HER\" when the piano gets tipped over.We hooked it up yesterday afternoon.  The sofware is very basic, but it seemed to have installed correcty.  I'm running Windows 7 64bit on an HP laptop.  My son is running the same but on a custom built desktop.  I also use this camera on my cell phone.The Good Stuff:-There is a slot for a mini SD card so you can record the videos as they are being captured, which is neat if you want to pull a photo off of the film.  The mini-SD is not included.-This can be used as a two way device, meaning you can speak to the room being monitored (like yelling at the dog to get off of the sofa and then laughing hysterically as he goes from shock to confusion to possible minor mental breakdown over why your VOICE is in the room by YOU are not!  This does require external speakers, which also are not included.  Otherwise, you can hear what the people in the room are saying, but you can't respond to them.-The video quality on the first day was excellent - clear, crisp and not much of a lag at all.-The unit must be plugged in, so that is a consideration when deciding where to put this camera.  But the camera itself is about the size of a typical point & shoot digital camera or maybe slightly larger than a deck of cards.  It has a removable stand that can be screwed into a door, wall or whatever.The Not Good Stuff:-Not that easy to set up.  My 15 year old son did most of it for me, but that was mostly out of laziness on my part, he was willing to run up and down the stairs between my laptop and the router (yeah, he could have just taken the laptop down, exercise is good)  But camera came with a CD for software installation that wouldn't play at first and then once I got it installed, I kept getting error messages.  My son doesn't get these messages on his computer.  The user interface isn't very intuitive on the website or on the manual, I'm still not sure how to get a lot of things to work correctly like picture quality (which degraded a great deal after the first day, now it's more like a super pixelated, grainy, old school web camera.  We're still working on messing with the settings but nothing seems to help and the website for the product isn't very informative either.-I have an android phone and my son has an iPod touch. The Apple version of the app has a lot more control (volume, alarms, etc). The Android version has NO help and really you can only watch the video, not do anything else.So, until I can figure out how to set the settings the way I want them to be set and how to set the video quality how I want for it to be set, I have to take off a star.  I have to take off another for no guide explaining the error codes and what to do about them.  If I am able to get these issues resolved, I will happily update my review and my stars.  In this day and age, where cars connect to cell phones, laptop connect to tablets, gaming systems connect to TV's and internet - it should be a snap to install this camera and have it run easily with a good help section on how to change the settings, trouble shooting, etc.  Getting all of the error codes is really frustrating.

You have to install the \"ping\" app from the website, on your phone or tablet, but it's compatible with most operating systems out there.Picture quality and video with the right SD card (there is NOT one included) is good in normal daylight, or interior well lit rooms, don't expect high quality at night. In fact the dual lens \"night vision\" which boasts up to 20' is not ideal, and very grainy black and white.Another nice (if not standard these days) feature is the motion sensor that activates and then signals your phone or PC if you have it set up for alerts.If you are away from home and using something like jump desktop for example, as long as your home PC is on and running(and that's where the Ping software is setup) you can monitor the camera from your own PC, from any PC anywhere, kind of cool.Overall it's a nice package, not cheap, but not that expensive either.

I have a baby monitor already and though the camera was wireless it has to be run via a dedicated network hub which is annoying. So I was quite excited about running this sleeker and more elegant looking wireless camera with motion detection. The plastics feel a bit light and cheap, but the camera doesn't look it. The mount/stand  is made from molded aluminum and nicely curved which finishes off the look.My first disappointment out the box was that it doesn't run on batteries and has to be powered by a powered USB port. Either from a device like a computer or a wall socket adapter. So it isn't THAT portable since it has to have an external power source of some kind in order to run.Set up was dead easy if you have a modern wireless router often all the password info you need is on a label on the back or the camera can make use of the automated WPS feature if your router supports it.The L-View software that comes with the camera is simple but effective and allows you to have up to 4 cameras running simultaneously. Your list of available cameras is on the right column which can be dragged to any of up to 4 windows on the screen to activate it.The default quality is quite low at 64k 640x480 resolution at 5 frames per second. Quality isn't actually bad considering that the bandwidth being used is equivalent to your average mp3 music track.A right click on the camera in L-View gives you a bunch of options where you can up the streaming quality and update to 30 fps in increments of 5. The motion sensor works very well as does the dynamic switching of night vision. I have a smallish house and the camera can see from the study across the corridor into the living room with no problem.One disappointment is that unlike my other Lorex system, this camera does not work with skype and isn't recognized physically on the computer as a device. Only the L-view software can see  it. This is good for security since it makes it harder to hack but does provide some limitations for those who want to make use of it as a general purpose web cam.I installed the Lorex Ping software on my Galaxy S Android phone and it found and displayed the camera view straight away with no trouble whatsoever.Overall this camera is ok, great if you want it for fairly portable wireless security security camera that works in the dark.

It covers up to 30 feet which is decent for inside a home or for use inside a chicken coop if you are interested in what or who is stealing your hens or eggs.

Ware", "ReviewID": "R13WZF7EWF5C30", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have a Panasonic wired camera and have been very pleased with it.  The Panasonic isn't very easy to setup for remote viewing but once setup it works great. I picked up the Lorex for its wireless capabilities so that I could place it easily around the house.  The Lorex is good on a number of things but it also falls short on several things as well.The pros1. Picture quality- I have found the picture quality to be very good.  Seems to be better than the Panasonic with better brightness in daylight and offers ability to see at night.2. Wireless- for the price the inclusion of the wireless is a good deal.Cons1. Setup- setup wasn't as smooth as I expected after reading about the product.  I wasn't able to setup the camera through my iphone so had to set it up via the web front end.2. Wireless connection- I'm running the camera through a Cisco wireless router and after a reboot of the camera it often does not find the router.  This has happened several times. I often have to unplug the camera, the router, and then start both back up. I had the same issue running it through an Apple wireless router.3.  Software- the software is a bit buggy on both the iOS devices and desktop pc I have tried.  The iOS application for iphone has crashed several times.  I have found the Ipad version to be better.  The software for MAC computer is not very intuitive and looks to be a port from PC version.  On the MAC version I have still not been able to bring up the video from the camera.4.  Camera pan- my Panasonic has the ability to move the camera lens remotely, the Lorex is fixed.5.  Web access- my Panasonic has a web based free service that allows you to bring up the camera without an application.  This is nice when at work and I want to see the camera without using my cellular data plan.  I am able to view the camera from my work PC on the Panasonic.  On the Lorex the only way to view the camera is through the lorex software or over a mobile device application.I gave this device 3 stars because of some of the features that are not available compared to other products.  Its a good start but I would consider other products before making a purchase of this camera.", "Date": "October 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "good, but not great", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2FH6X46JWEA5H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a nice IP based camera.

I won't go into the details but it doesn't work, and I ended up uninstalling it from my PC.It works quite well on my Android phone, however, a Samsung Galaxy S III.  You just have to long press on the phone's ID # for the menu to come up and you can adjust all sorts of settings and arrange to have a picture e-mailed to you whenever motion is detected, or sound or both depending on how you set it up.All very well, I set it up to my Gmail address and, despite the 1 to 10 scale of sensitivity, in reality it's all or nothing.  No matter what setting I put it on, I either end up getting a picture mailed to me every 5 seconds - I've had to delete 150 e-mails from my account - or no notifications come through at all.The picture and sound quality are excellent and probably much clearer than the picture you see of yourself at your local convenience store.But so what?  What is the point of having this device, a \"wireless\" camera with a very short power cord and no battery?  Unless you can amuse yourself all day watching your driveway, which is where I have the camera focussed at the moment, I really don't see the point.  I chose the camera because  my neighbour had been complaining about scary noises in the night and our driveways overlap.  I'm afraid to put her email address on the camera now because she'll become furious at me to find 150 or more useless pictures filling up her inbox.Everything about this kit screams BETA to me.  It's a good camera.  It connects well with the mobile app for Android they've developed - at least on the Galaxy S III,  though forget about your computer.  But I'm having to use an extension cord to mount it where it's useful to me.If you're looking for a good surveillance camera, look elsewhere.  I've spent the better part of three days fiddling with the software, calling customer service, etc. and I've given up on getting quality use out of it.But I notice that this is version 1.0 of the mobile app.  Lorex, update the software a little more and this thing might be worth the bother, and, btw, the paper-clip reset solution does not work!", "Date": "October 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Geeky cool!", "Author": "atmj", "ReviewID": "R1KXAIE84D6Z9N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is the coolest thing.Setup was complicated only by the fact we tried to use the button on the router, not knowing if we had WPS or not, to connect wirelessly. Apparently we don't.  So we hard-wired this camera to our router.  Having previously followed the instructions, I had already loaded the software on my PC.  Following the steps in the quick start, I was looking at the room, my router was in, in no time.  But, once this was connected, I could move this camera anywhere in the house and once I plugged it in to a standard wall jack for power, the wireless took over from there.The best thing is when I hooked up my Lorex Ping software for my smartphone and while sitting at work could spy on my cats at home.There are no fees, just a need of a wireless router.  I was wowed.I can take a still shot and even listen to the noise in the house.  You can set up some recording (which would need an SD card),  you can record based on motion detection,  I have not done all that yet, still just  tickled about being able to see in inside my house when I am away.  Another cool thing is that it has infrared, so when there is little light, the camera still works.  It is in black and white, but you aren't trying to match socks when you are using it, so all is good.Needless to say, you don't want to put this in potentially embarrassing locations.I don't know the first thing about security or such, so please rely on the web info for this, or the specs.  I showed this to a developer colleague of mine and he thought it might make an interesting baby monitor or nanny cam.I will write more as we use it more.

It is an idea whose time is here, and it is amazing that it arrived in a very small box.  Digital technology like this is now available to all of us at very reasonable prices, even if there are privacy issues when anyone can take photos or video on a cell phone.  \"Big Brother\" in the living room?

Beyond that though, in all seriousness...when I was younger my apartment was robbed. Since then I've always been a little paranoid about everything when I'm not home. I worry about where I've left expensive items out, how easy it could be to get in and all those lovely paranoia break-in issues. Getting this out of the box, it was super easy to set up, took about 10 minutes. It has wifi, so it didn't need to be near hardwired into my modem which is wonderful. Downloaded the app on my iPhone and iPad 3 in moments and that was also very easy to set up with the password key on the back of the camera. I attached this high up in my living room and angled it to catch both the front door and the dog's bed. I was astounded that I could watch my house live time on my iPhone 4s when I'm not home! I tell people I'm bringing up my nanny-cam and we watch the dog sleep, cause really that's all he's ever doing when I'm not there. I like that you could hear things if there was any noise to be heard, would love it if you could speak back!! Otherwise, my only problems are that I wish it was a wide angle, almost fish eye lens. I have a small living room so there's only so far up and back I can go to get a good span of the room. Also, I have had a few times when it couldn't pull up the live camera view from my phone.
