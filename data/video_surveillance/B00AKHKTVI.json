{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Proceed with Caution!! Not worth the $$", "Author": "owlmommy", "ReviewID": "R1FPARH9SLXDPF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "**skip to the bottom for a final update!!!I have been on a hunt for the right baby monitor system for our large 4000 sq ft + home. After finding that the top-rated analog monitors wouldn't work for a house our size (Samsung, Motorolla, etc with 900 ft range) we decided to go the wifi route.First we purchased the Withings monitors that are sold and endorsed by Apple. I didn't like that we had to use two iphones or two ipads to monitor our two children. So we called Wifi Baby to ask about their product and see if it would be a better fit. Over the phone, I asked whether monitoring was free or if there was any additional charge I would have once I bought the cameras. I was assured that monitoring is free, so I was pretty disappointed to wind up being charged an additional $14 per app to use the monitoring system after I just spent $500 on two cameras. The funny thing is that had they charged that extra fee up-front I don't think I would have minded. I was bothered by feeling that this was hidden. When I asked about it, I was told that technically monitoring is free, after you buy the app. So yeah, I guess its a matter of semantics, but one thing is obvious - I should have been told up-front when I was on the phone and clearly asking about this.So besides that, how does the 2.0 look and compare to the withings?? Stick with withings. The only feature that the Wifi Baby does better than Withings is a nicer camera picture. The Wifi camera is VERY clear in terms of image in bright day (color) or a night. The pic is really bad at sort of dusk when the camera doesnt know if it should flip between night vision or daytime. Then its not really useable. SO if your baby sleeps for late naps or at dusk, the image is bad then. Overall it has a great image most of the day/night.But ugh- the audio is soooo bad. And I don't know about you, but when I'm sleeping or doing stuff at home, I need good audio on a baby monitor. Keep in mind I have two wifibaby 2.0 monitors, so its not like I got a bad one. The audio is weak and garbled. Nothing like the withings or my analog monitors.Next deal breaker is the way the picture looks on my phone. So since I spent $500 on the two cameras, I don't like the idea of spending another $300-$700 on a big ipad to view the kids. The appeal of this wifibaby system was that I could see more than one baby at a time and have simultaneous audio from my iphone. Well do the math- once the iphone screen is divided into four quadrants, and each baby gets less than 1/4 of that, you can imagine that the image is soooo small its sort of lame and pointless. I think a good improvement would be a split screen so that parents of two kids can have at least somewhat larger pics to view. Its a shame that half of my small iphone screen was just wasted space. Besides, Im guessing most parents with a need for dual monitors will be viewing two, not four kids at a time, right??? (i.e. a 2 year old and a newborn).The mounting option and angles are lame too.... as you have to hard mount it. Ugh. But the clamshell design of the withings is pretty lame as well. What makes up for it is the withings has lots of nice bells and whistles (lullabies, temperature monitoring, etc. that I REALLY liked). You get NONE of these perks with wifibaby, but still the high pricetag.Last is the delay. I have the absolute top of the line high speed connection here and with buffering when I ran both the wifibaby and the withings simultaneously I couldn't believe how much more of a delay there was on the wifibaby. The withings audio is about 2-3 seconds faster than the wifibaby.Ultimately the truly sad part about wifi baby monitors in general (all of them, not just the wifibaby brand) is that they occasionally disconnect at night when you're sleeping, or they freeze at times, or they shut off when too many other apps are running, etc. It just happens. And it happens frequently. I don't think there is anything that can be done about it. I was running these monitors on an iphone (ATT) 5 and a 4s BOTH and had issues with both. When it comes to babies and sleeping, you want to have something reliable. The withings had many issues with the same disconnecting, etc. but far less than the wifibaby. Both brands of monitors also sometimes randomly would show an image from days earlier. So like I'm watching her sleep for a few hours, and then BAM the image changes to one from a few days ago (I know by what my baby was wearing) and freezes there!! Apparently wifi monitors do this as other moms I know have the same issue.Oh and withings is sooo easy and user friendly right from the box. The wifibaby was UGH annoying. Sort of like opening instructions that were typed up in china. The nice compensation for this is that wifibaby does have pretty resposive customer support, and aside from the mild dishonesty I mentioned earlier, they are very friendly and knowledgeable.I would NOT spend this amount of money on a product with so many flaws. If you google it seems the best wifi monitor to get is actually a FOSCAM camera which is funny since its not specifically geared toward kids but does all that the wifi baby monitor options can do yet costs a fraction of the price. I will be investing in a foscam system and saving my withings monitors as well, but returning the wifibaby monitors 100%!! Oh and also, wifibaby makes you pay shipping, etc on returns and has only a 30 day policy. With all the others you have a whole year to return and the shipping is FREE!Get a samsung 3037W or a motorolla bp36 (BOTH AMAZING!!) if the range will work for you. Otherwise if you're like me and have a huge house get a FOSCAM (based on what I have read) or from my experience thus far, get a withings.FINAL UPDATE: The ONLY video monitor that reaches in a my home 4000s feet/multi level - is the Vtech VM321 with 1000ft range. We now have two. It works great and is reliable unlike any other wifi version we have tried. Its also really cheap in my opinion!! Not the super nice picture quality like motorolla or samsung, but it works well and the pic isnt terrible. Hope this helps someone out there!!", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "very cool system", "Author": "flyfisher32", "ReviewID": "R2BO2B0DFG479H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I' m pretty technilogically iliterate but I wanted a baby monitor that my wife or I could easily view of our new baby no matter where we were.  Both my wife and I travel occasionally for our jobs so I thought it would be great to have a baby camera that allowed us to see our child whether we were in the living room or accross the country.  Needless to say this does that very easily and on all of our devices...we joke that I'm a PC and my wife is a Mac so she uses her Iphone, Ipad and Mac while I use my Android phone and my PC and they all work great with this camera.  I must say their IT support is amazing, on one phone call the very nice and knowledgeable tech support rep helped me easily set up all of our devices, set up a secure way to share access to family or fiends if we wanted to, and helped me understand how to adjust any setting in only about a half an hour and we had everything functioning on wifi.  I wish all companies had such helpful support for their products. Oh, and the night vision really works great just make sure it is set to auto and it works perfectly and adjusts instantly when you turn on and off the lights.  My only disclaimer is that I've never owned any other baby monitors so I can't give any comparative info but now that I have this one I don't know why I would ever want anything different.", "Date": "July 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just a relabeled Y-Cam", "Author": "flyboy \"karlpk\"", "ReviewID": "R1L9OO8PVP7VZP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera is a relabeled Y-cam, which sells for about $100 less.  IT has all the same problems and shortcomings as the Y-cam.  So you can look under \"Y-cam Black SD\" to get a few more honest reviews about it. (Here's the spoiler, As a Y-cam it gets 2.5 stars).  Anyway here's the Pro's and ConsPro's--Nice and small, attractive-Relatively easy to assemble-Nice color picture-They don't overburden you with too much in the way of instructions or set up. I guess they figure it's all pretty intuitive.- They answer the phone when you call them.  Which you'll need to..Cons-- You pay $12.00 for an iphone app to access this on your Iphone.  But.. It only works in your house.  There are no instructions on how to set this up when you are outside the area of you home wifi.  So you will end up calling customer support.  Hence all the great reviews about their customer support.- You contact customer support/fill out a support ticket for help stating the problem and the time to be reached and someone emails you and says when they will call you back.  Then cross your fingers.  I went to bed after midnight still waiting.- The box shows a full screen Iphone picture from the camera.  Your picture will be half that size.- The software offers lots of settings where you can change things both on the Iphone App, and on the computer.  Unfortunately no where in anything included are any instructions given regarding when to change these settings and what they do.- I was actually able to get this thing running so I could see the picture on my home computer and Iphone(at home) but for about $60.00 you can get a very nice camera for watching your kid in your home, and not waste days of your life learning about port forwarding, internal and external IP addresses, Dtdns, and passwords to things you didn't even know existed on your system.Again- Notice every favorable review involved a call to customer service. It's great that they have customer service that sometimes helps you out.  Not so good when every good review is because someone had to call customer service.Follow-up:  I did end up speaking to customer service, and they were helpful.  They also sent me an email asking that I write them a favorable review on Amazon and mention the technicians name. Incidentally the phone technicians are contracted network engineers with day jobs around the country for whom this is pretty easy.  I spent an hour and a half with one, and I consider myself pretty comfortable with a computer. Anyway the system works.  It's a pain to set up, nothing intuitive here.  You have to go digging for instructions to do anything.

It took me approximately two weeks to receive the camera as amazon would not ship this product directly to Germany. Instead I had to ship it to the states and from there forward it to myself. I finally have the camera and it is a day two of using it. So here are the pros and cons so far:Pros:1. The camera comes with dual voltage (110-240V) as well as the plug adapters for Europe and UK, which is great for people living overseas.2. Very clear image during the day and in complete darkness.3. You can manually zoom in and out4. No noticeable delay when operated off of the home Wi-FiCons:1. Camera does not rotate so the image is fixed until someone manually moves the camera2. The image is blur if the light in the room is not bright enough or if it is not completely dark.3. Installation is a nightmare, especially with foreign routers. However, the customer support is outstanding.4. When using away from home function either on a different WiFi or 3G network, there is at least 5-7 second delay on the image.5. You have to purchase an $11.99 app to use this product on Apple devices...which is really not a con but I think it should either be included in the price or disclosed upfront.Customer support (5 stars):The WiFi baby customer support is very prompt and efficient. First, due to an unknown reason I was unable to install the software that came with the WiFi Baby cam. I contacted tech support via email, and within an hour received a response with a scheduled time for the same day to conduct screen-share and a phone conference to resolve my issue. Since I am located overseas, Gary, the tech was able to provide me with a local (German) phone number that I could call to join the conference, which saved me from paying long distance phone charges. Since I have a foreign router and all of the instructions and configurations are not in English, that made the set up process a lot more complicated. However, Gary was very patient and knowledgeable, and was able to connect the router to the camera in less than an hour even with router configurations being in a foreign language.I am not computer illiterate, but without Gary's expertise I would have not be able to get this camera up and running even with the step by step instructions provided on the website. After the setup, I received a follow up email with everything that we had accomplished...that again just indicates that they really care about their customers.So overall, the product is good and the customer service is beyond great. Will definitely recommend it to others and will buy it again in the future.", "Date": "November 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "FIRE HAZARD , CAMERA MELTED!!!", "Author": "daniel Pringle", "ReviewID": "RPRY2YZ80ZKV4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera last year to watch my newborn. To my absolute horror, I walked in one day, and the camera plate had gotten so hot it melted itself. I contacted the company immediately, photos included, and demanded a refund. The initial response was 'well you bought it from another website so we will have to recover the money from them first'. Pretty outraged, I asked them if they'd rather a lawsuit, or go out of pocket $250 to refund me so I could buy a camera from ANOTHER company. They promptly accomodated me. I told them I'd be reporting it to consumer affairs, AND to retail websites, as I feel its my responsibility to let other families know about this gravely concerning issue. If it happened to my camera, it could happen to someone elses. I'm personally shocked they never recalled the camera, as next time it could be a fire in someone's nursery.

I have followed the directions on two different computers of mine and have had the same empty result.  Beware that if you think you are going to buy this item and quickly set it up you will be disappointed.  From what I am reading on other reviews a significant amount of buyers could not get a hold of someone by phone and had to put in a online request.  Then the wifibaby tech will have to take over your computer to set it up.  The setup manual is very difficult to use.  It appears that an intern haphazardly organized the installation manual.  I bought the item well in advance of the arrival of our baby and made two concerted efforts to get the monitor running to no avail.  Now I have a two week old and I still cannot get the monitor to work and I cannot get tech support on the phone to help.  Again, if you are close to your due date I would look at other options or buy it and forgo the installations instructions and just put in online service request in.

Upon receiving our WIFI Baby Cam I quickly got down to it and started the process. I'm not very tech savvy but I do my best to work through things to get them to work how they should. Unfortunately this was not the case with the WIFI Baby Cam. I did get it to work but not long after, it started having problems. Nothing seemed to work like it should. I quickly wrote an email to the company asking for help. To my surprise I received an email back very quickly from their tech support guru Gary. We emailed back and forth and eventually touched base with a phone call. He was very polite and helpful. After all was said and done, we spent an hour on the phone explaining everything to me and helping me set it up exactly how I needed it. Even got it to work so the Grandparents could view it from back home. Needles to say, I have not had any problems or issues with this product.

Other reviews have gone over the details of images, etc.  Know this: you can see your child or whatever it is that you bought this for clearly on your smartphone or tablet.  For most of us parents, that is the bottom line and the specs become somewhat overwhelming.  While I am electronics geek at heart, you don't need to know the technical details of this monitor: you just need to know that the monitor accomplishes what it sets out to do very well (see your child).The real reason to consider buying this monitor is the customer service.  What other company do you know staffs technical support after 5pm on weekdays and anytime on weekends?  My wife and I both work, and to have a company that understands this concept and has actual human beings you can talk to you away from business hours when normal people are actually home is phenomenal.  We have two of these monitors, and I set up a time with Gary (one of their tech guys) to call me at 730pm on a sunday night after my girls were asleep so that I could set up the monitors in peace.  He called me, was able to screen share within minutes (where they can, with your permission, log on to your computer), and helped me set up both monitors in less than 15 minutes.  There was no guesswork, as he was on the phone with me and fixing the settings on my MacBook at the same time.  For our busy life, it was perfect.There are plenty of other monitors on the market, and if you are tecnically saavy, check them out and set up your own wireless network and streaming.  If you are not, then WifiBaby will set it up for you and you are ready to start watching the kids.

I have some technical know-how and had two cameras running in a matter of about 15 minutes.  Port forwarding for remote  might be a different matter, and if you have never ventured in your router before I could see how you would find this difficult.  I had a simple question regarding direct Ethernet connectivity and wifi range.  I opened a ticket just wanting a basic answer.  The next day my tech, Leo, contacted me directly and remoted into my PC.  He went into my router, and set up my system with static IPs (something I was going to get around to). I knew how to do all of what he did, but he was able to complete the task in about 15 minutes. He could have just emailed a yes or no, but he, and by extension the company, went the extra mile.

If you are at all a light sleeper this constant sound will keep you up at night.  You can mute it but then of course you won't hear the baby cry.2) We still can't get the device to work off of our wifi network on my iPhone- neither on a 3G network nor on any other wifi network.  My husband's Droid works perfectly fine on or off of our wifi system but my iphone only works on our home wifi system.  Perhaps we can schedule a service call but really, with an infant in the house who has time for that... and we already had to do that once to get the device up and running initially and even then we literally had to calendar an appointment with a Wifi Baby technician!3) The camera is a fixed angle. It can zoom in/out but it can't go up/down or left/right as can other other models.4) Wifi Baby doesn't have its own software so you have to purchase secondary software from an unrelated provider.  Wifi Baby recommends Sunshine Apps which we purchased- new purchases for each viewing device by the way which adds considerably to the cost of this system if you're two parents, each of whom has a phone and each of whom wants to be able to view the device from a remote location.  Sunshine Apps then sends you messages/alerts trying to solicit more funds- \"donations\"- saying they can no longer support their software!  So yes, Wifi Baby created a technology but not the software to run it on and the software they recommend you purchase is no longer being supported?!5) There is no feature to turn on the device when the baby makes noise (i.e. have the viewing device be in sleep mode until the baby moves/cries then light up to alert you of the activity).  As a result you must leave your viewing device on all night if you want to hear the baby when s/he cries... go back and read note 1) above as to why this is a serious deficiency!6) The device requires being screwed into wherever it's mounted rather than providing an option for a clip on.  Do you want to screw the device into your crib rails or into a stud in your wall... do you want holes in your crib or wall?!6 Month UPDATE: we've been using Wifi Baby for 6 months now.  We just switched our home router and once again after two hours of trying to set up Wifi Baby got frustrated and called for help.  Wifi Baby informed us that our one year warranty includes a ONE TIME set up assistance and if we wanted help setting it up a second time then we would need to pay a service fee. So our warranty is still valid but they won't help us.  Service FAIL. PS I've also now updated iphones to the latest 5S and Wifi Baby still doesn't work on it outside our home wifi network.

Unfortunately, you must pay an additional fee for a smart phone/iPad app to view it. All of this I knew going in. (FYI the only iPhone/iPad app they provide support for has a frequent pop up asking for donations because they're going under. Glad I spent $10 on an app that is soon going to be obsolete). What I didn't expect was the issues with customer service/technical support.When the camera works, everything is great. I have owned the camera for 3 months and have had to call technical support 3 times. Each time I have had to wait an average of 3 days to have someone help me. What the other reviews don't mention is that there is a limited amount of technical support available. While they are very helpful when they do call, it does take a significant amount of time to get an appointment.I wish I hadn't have ever purchased. I had done extensive research and honestly WiFi baby is comparable to many other wifi baby monitors out there. I am going to have to buy ANOTHER monitor because every month I go 3-4 days without a baby monitor. It defeats the purpose of having a monitor.It seemed worth the extra money (instead of buying foscam) because of the Amazon reviews of great customer service. I then purchased this WiFi monitor over other comparable products because again I thought the customer service would be a valuable asset.Before purchasing keep in mind when reading so many positive Amazon reviews about stellar customer service, that every time WiFi baby helps (even after initial set up) they send you emails requesting you to write positive reviews on Amazon. Even if you didn't purchase on Amazon. WiFi Baby is clearly aware that Amazon requests are fueling their sales.

PIcture quality is good during the day and also at night.  There is absolutely no problem seeing our baby at night.  The microphone is incredible and picks up every last little noise.I will say that there is no way I could have set up the camera to work on our network without the help of the Wifi Baby tech support.  So, ease of setup is low.  My network consists of a verizon fios router that then goes into an Apple time capsule that functions as our wireless router.  So, I still don't really understand it, but having both devices increases the complexity of setup.  However, what absolutely saves the day is the Wifi Baby tech support.  It is no joke that they, Gary in my case, was SO helpful.  I submitted my help request online and Gary quickly contacted me, set up time to speak on the phone, and then quickly was able to set everything up himself by using a screen share program.  Gary sent me a follow up email stating all the different actions he took and all of the passwords and what the DNS addresses and ports should be.  Then, weeks later, I contacted Gary with a question and he volunteered to help me re-configure my wifi baby set up in response to my question.  So nice :)To use the camera, one really needs to use the 3rd party app....I have not checked recently, but last time I did, using an internet browser window to view the camera output didn't work so well.  In my case, it seemed to freeze after a few minutes and so I would have to refresh to get it to start again.  But, again, I have not really looked into it too much b/c I just use the app.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the app costs an additional $12 or something.  Yes, it is sorta expensive, but it is a one time cost.  As soon as you buy it, you don't think about it again.  But, make sure you have the app when you work with the Wifi Baby tech support.  They will make sure you have the app set up correctly also.I will caution also that how well the app works depends on how strong your wireless signal is in your house.  If it isn't strong, the video/audio of the app will disconnect and then reconnect periodically (when your wireless signal gets too weak).So, in a nutshell, I like using my iPhone as the monitor part b/c I ALWAYS have my iPhone on me...but it isn't like one can use the phone for anything else if you are using it as the monitor.  So, if you are at home, and want to still have your iphone available to use, might be good to use your old iPhone as the monitor :)And, last comment, don't wait until the last minute to set up the camera and app as it will take a bit of time.

I am generally tech saavy so I considered a bunch of ip cameras on the market.  I thought I could do the configuration myself even if it was a little complicated but was happy to find WifiBaby since buying a camera made for surveillance purposes and configuring the network seemed a little annoying while I was 8 months pregnant.  I was able to set up the camera easily on our home network for viewing over our wifi by following the tutorials on the wifibaby website and the included instructions.  I did this before the baby was born.  After the baby was a few weeks old I decided to finally try to set up the outside network viewing and I almost was able to do it with the instructions online but ended up having to fill out a support ticket.  Gary was great and we set up a call within a day or two, we screenshared and he basically just set it up for me.  I probably wouldn't be able to replicate what he did so if I moved or things got reset I'd probably have to call again but it's working great for now.  Overall pretty easy to setup and good for a late term pregnant lady/new mom with very low brain capacity!I like being able to record to a miniSD card since I already have a bunch on hand from cameras and other devices.  I knew from investigating online that I would have to purchase apps for our devices to be able to view the camera so that didn't bother me.  We bought the android app tiny cam pro for my android phone and the baby monitor hd for my husband's iphone.  I actually like the ios app better (I like the visual tracking of sound) but the android app works fine too (you can turn the leds on and off within the app).  It was cool to be able to check in on the baby the first time we left him at home with someone else, even better than calling.  The camera quality is great for our purposes, I can even see my baby blinking.  Using the LEDs at night is key, it works great and the red lights don't bother my baby.  I wish there was a way to change the position of the camera through the apps like with a standard baby monitor.  We just used it while a sitter was watching the baby and the baby was juuuust out of frame.  If I could have moved the camera down just a bit I could have seen the baby.  For now we prop it up on a bookcase near the crib and wheel the bassinet right near it, when the baby is older and can reach the bookcase I see how you might need to mount it or something but for now the stand works fine.This may be a software/app issue but the camera refreshes a LOT when I'm viewing it on my android phone (Galaxy S4).  Each time it refreshes it mutes the audio.  This is annoying when I'm trying to listen in on my baby while I'm in another room.  I asked Gary about this while he was fixing my set up.  He changed some settings but it's still happening and is annoying but not a deal breaker.Pros: easy to set up on wifi network, great customer service, picture is extremely clear, you can set it to record to SD card or alert you when it senses movement, limited choice on apps - they just tell you which one to use which I likedCons: hard to set up over 3G/4G (outside my wifi network) by myself so I had to find time to contact customer support which is hard with a newborn, can't adjust the angle of the camera remotely (not really a con since I knew that in advance), the camera refreshes really often which turns off the audioOverall: The camera itself is good, the picture quality is better than I expected, it's a good size and relatively easy to set up with help from customer support.  It has worked well for us on both android and ios devices.  My husband has been able to look at the baby while he's gone which was our main goal.  If this wasn't our objective I might have gone with a traditional video and audio monitor but I'm glad we didn't.

We have tried multiple systems and all seem to have certain shortcomings but this product has all of the essential features that we were looking for.  We wanted good image clarity, good sound, multiple camera capability, remote monitoring (while away from house from smart phone/devices), and support to help if/when issues come up. A previous reviewer mentioned that the screen is split when you have multiple cameras; while this is true, that is just one way to view the video feed, all you do is just tap on the camera you want to focus on and it will be full screen, or you can even do a picture-in-picture view.  This product is a bit higher in cost than some, but it really isn't if you consider the amazing support that you receive.  While I am happy with all features of this product, I would say by far the best aspect, is the amazing help and support the company offers. They helped us set-up everything at whatever time was good for us, which is later in the evening for us due to work and baby schedules.  No other company is this flexible. And even months after the initial set-up, we made a mistake on one of the settings and they were more than happy to fix it for us.

Bought this camera six months ago and am so glad I did! Can't imagine living without it now as I mainly use wi-fi around the house, but switch to 4G when outside gardening or letting hubby view from work.  Set-up for wifi was easy - I did it myself with no problem. Downloading the identified app from the Android store also a cinch (app was free even).  Just had to do it for each phone, but used the same access port.  Getting the remote access over 4G was quite a bit trickier, but once I got customer service on the line, they got me up and running in an hour.  The expense was worth having the excellent customer service. It is nice to be able to go to sleep at night and be able to hear/see the little one.Cons: Wish it came with different attachment bases. I used to keep the camera on the top crib railing, but now the little one knows to knock it off to get mommy's attention.  The ability to angle more would be nice.  Also there is a distinct red glow from the leds, which is not bad - really it is the green power light which is truly distracting at night.  Will have to tape it to keep it from being too bright.

It can also be configured to take pictures when there's said movement and email it to an account of your choice. Instead of movement, you can also configure it to take pictures at an interval of your choice. My favorite features are the internet streaming for free (all you need to know is your public IP address) and the squelch which allows custom settings to suppress the background noise and alert you when sound surpasses the level you set.

I purchased the overpriced app they recommended, $12 for iPhone, and it was up and running. You can use your computer or bookmark the page on your phone and that will work for free, but the app allows quick viewing of up to 4 cams with the touch of the icon.However, as soon as I left the wifi of my house is when I realized there was more to this. I was hoping to find a way around having to do the port forwarding thing since it seemed over my head. The manual does not come with any additional information on the other technical aspects this monitor provides so you have to use their website wifibaby.net. The site has plenty of support tips, but you have to weed through to find what tip you are looking for or read other peoples comments with the same problem. After searching I finally realized the info I needed was under their support icon and \"nannycam\" setup. Once I went their and read some info and tried to figure it out on my own I finally called their technical support and sent them an email. If you are average or less with computers or have never heard of the term port forwarding and plan to use this monitor outside of your home/wifi area (what they refer to as using it as a \"NannyCam\") then fill out a support ticket right away on their webpage and have them call you. Here is the rub with their support:The Negative:If you call you will have to leave a message and they will call you back mon-fri, you just have no clue when this will be. My first callback was within 30 min. The next took over an hour. So be ready to set it down and be flexible.Fill out the support ticket on their website and have them call you, unless you think you can figure it out over emails. They will again get back to you sometime that day.The Positive:The technician was extremely knowledgable and was willing to go through everything until I had it working the way I wanted. Have all your stuff and questions ready so they can help you.In summary this product sets up very easily right out of the box if you plan on using it just in your home wifi area, but if you plan on using it anywhere outside that or with 3G or setting up to get email alerts you will need some assistance more than likely. Once their support gets a hold of you they will get you all hooked up.This would have been a 5 if their manual or website explained using it outside of a wifi network more clearly but it was kind of hidden as a NannyCam feature. I believe to view any camera outside of your network you will need to go through the port forwarding process, so at least wifibaby's technicians are savvy and will get you through it.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Customer service is incredible", "Author": "ryan", "ReviewID": "R2E7QRVLFBQXZS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When we ran into an issue trying to get our router set up properly, Gary set an appointment and did a great job getting our monitor dialed in and working great.

Trust me on this one... read my experience.", "Author": "hgp2013", "ReviewID": "R39U5E8TVJXAHW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've never reviewed a product online but I felt it was necessary to share my experience with mom's considering this product.  I was very excited about a wifi monitor... how cool, right?  Wrong.  I think it's a great idea in theory, but they still have a lot of kinks to work out and the customer service has been less than helpful.  First I spent, $259 on a baby monitor when a $120 video monitor would've been fine.  When you set up the product, you have to download the app, which they charge you another $12 for.  When you spend that much money on a monitor, shouldn't the app be free???  We had to spend $12 for each download... my phone, my husband's phone (he has a different iTunes account), and then our nanny's phone.  Another $36 just to get the monitor to work... ridiculous.Set up was less than easy, though I will say their tech support is helpful.  The real bummer here is no one is available to help you on demand.  You have to set up an appointment which is typically 24 hours out.  Once we got the monitor up and running, it didn't work well.  It constantly cut out, but I was still jazzed on the best of the best baby monitor so I figured it was a problem on our end.  I spent $199.99 on a new modem, which didn't solve the problem.  So then I spent another $199.99 on the best wireless router, which (you guessed it) didn't solve the problem  either.  I then paid $50 to have my internet provider come out and install an internet outlet closer to our bedroom.  Problem. Still. Not. Solved.  So, I've spent a grand total of $745 trying to get my monitor to work.  At this point, I'm feeling rather foolish but I just deal with a monitor that cuts in and out (which is scary when you wake up in the middle of the night and your monitor is blacked out... and you have no idea for how long).FAST FORWARD 7 MONTHS....I am going to bed a week and a half ago and the monitor won't work on my phone.  So I try to pull it up on the iPad... no luck.  I try for 30 minutes to get it to work and then give up and hope it comes back on in the middle of the night (this has happened before).  The next morning (Friday), I set up a time for tech support to diagnose the problem, which will be the next day (Saturday).  The tech support guy (who is very helpful, by the way) tells me that the monitors wifi capabilities have crapped out and I need a new monitor... after 7 months.  You have got to be kidding me!  Isn't the whole point of a \"wifi\" monitor that it works with your wireless internet connection???  He sends me the information to get a new monitor, which is covered by my warranty.  I complete all the necessary paperwork and submit my credit card number for a $200 refundable deposit to have my new monitor expedited since at this point I have been without it for 3 days.  Monday comes and goes... I hear nothing.  On Tuesday, the returns department starts hassling me about my warranty.  I respond and provide as much information as possible the same day.  I hear nothing back, so on Wednesday I send a follow up email asking if my new monitor has shipped.  I hear nothing so I call and leave a message and then email my tech support guy begging for his help.  On Thursday I receive an email (my call went unreturned) stating it's not their intention to cause frustration but they are still having problems with my warranty.  As a good faith, they ship my replacement monitor overnight to me.  That would be great and all if I hadn't paid for an expedited replacement 6 DAYS EARLIER!!!!  CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A JOKE!!!!!  Aside from the tech support guy, I am beyond frustrated with the lack of timely responses from their returns department.  I wish I could just return the replacement camera and by a regular video monitor.Another downfall of the monitor is if you receive an Outlook calendar invite or reminder on your phone, that overrides the monitor which means the invitation stays up on your phone and the monitor cuts out.  Very frustrating as I am business professional and use Outlook to organize my life.  I can't tell you how many times I have woken up and the monitor has been blank, which is terrifying as a first time parent.This has just been my experience.  I would strongly recommend going in another direction.  I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  My feeling is anyone who has rated this product with 3 or more stars hasn't had it very long and they will be in my shoes in a few short months.

We can access the camera via each of our iPhones, iPads, MacBook & PC.2. We currently only have/need 1 camera, however, in the future we can access multiple cameras on a single device with split screens without having to have a separate device or app for each different camera, this was really the biggest deal breaker for us.3. The customer support reviews were very favorable.Upon receiving the camera, I was very anxious to get it all set up, which was very easy given the installation disc and setup instructions. I was immediately pleased with everything about the camera: a. The sleek look of the camera b. The functionality of being able to move the camera around easily from room to room as needed, or the capability to mount it if so desired. c. The great picture quality in light and dark rooms d. The included ethernet cable (for setup) as I didn't have a spare one kicking around.Everything was perfect, until I realized that I was not able to view my camera externally, from outside of our network or on 3G. So then I went about reading their troubleshooting guide till I felt I had it all memorized and yet nothing had worked.  I then submitted a trouble ticket and had a response within JUST HOURS!!I ended up being helped by, Errol, who is an outstanding support technician! I opted for my assistance to be via remote screen support and Errol got right to work and within minutes he figured out the issue that was preventing my being able to view our camera externally.  It really had nothing to do with Wifi Baby being overly complicated (as I've read in some other reviews), it was really the way our ISP set up our router(s) on our property.  I called my ISP to have them reconfigure some of my settings and Errol waited VERY PATIENTLY on the line for an HOUR back and forth. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to resolve my configuration issues right away so I had to contact Errol again a couple days later when I had things in order.Once I contacted Errol to finish my setup, he connected remotely to my screen again and within 10 minutes, he had my external viewing set up on my computer and on my phones! This experience was so incredibly outstanding, it truly puts the SUPPORT in customer support! Did I mention the awesome hours that they are available to assist? Well, I am pretty sure they are available to help well into the evening, perhaps 9PM? Errol really was a pleasure to deal with and I would certainly refer every single one of my friends/family to purchase this product, if nothing other than for the outstanding one on one true customer support available to you, if you need it!DEFINITELY choose this camera, I'm sure glad we did!P.S.There is a separate third party app to purchase (I think $11.99) that works with this camera, however, it is not mandatory so if that is really a deal breaker for you then keep that in mind.

He was running a few minutes late and sent me an email letting me know.  Eric was very patient, knowledgeable and he spoke ENGLISH!I would recommend this baby monitor. Even though the set up is a little involved, the outcome is worth it.  I can see my baby on my ipad, iphone and pc at home or away.  Audio and picture is excellent.

Gary patiently walked me through each step of the setup (2 cameras to 2 iPhones, a MacBook and an iPad) explaining what was being done along the way. He is easily the best computer technician we have ever dealt with.

This is unacceptable, but to make matters worse, the truth is that it's closer to 15 seconds with the best settings I could find. There is also no way to alert on sound (only motion) with the suggested ip-camera streaming app.It's just a Y-cam with outdated firmware and crappy support. The Y-cam itself goes for much less than half the cost of this, and has equivalent functionality.I have a masters in computer science and it took me a long time to set up.Since it's a crappy product, even purchasing the equivalent Y-cam which is much less expensive is not something that makes sense.

Aaron", "ReviewID": "RS3UZZLVALWRQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I don't own this cam, but I see a lot wrong with the concept and the price.I cringe at the thought of using IR lights on a sleeping baby.  Calling a cam a \"baby cam\" that uses IR is crazy to me.  I myself have used an IP cam with IR light and it nearly blinded me at a range of about 6 feet before I realized it can harm you, thankfully I recovered.  You see, the problem is the light is very bright, but you can't see it with your eyes, the human eye doesn't respond and thus doesn't normally contract and defend itself.  You don't realize you should close your eyes, put your hands over your eyes or turn away as you normally would with visible light that is bright and shining in your eyes.Some may want to argue this point, but I say if there's even a chance of hurting your baby or anyone else it's not worth it.  Save IR for outside surveillance.  Test it on yourself, about the same distance you want it at night with the IR lights on and look into it for 15 minutes and see how you feel.  Keep in mind you'll have it aimed at or near your baby all night every night.I would recommend getting a good low light cam without IR, maybe put a night light on near the baby.  Low, ambient light with a good, low-cost cam is what I would buy myself.I have looked at dozens of different brands and IP cams.  The best one I found with a decent picture and good viewing angle is the Edimax 3115 usually around $60-70, but sometimes they will go on sale for $40-50.  It doesn't have h.264 tho, and no IR (which is good for a baby cam), but the picture quality is great with enough light, 74 degree viewing angle, 1.3 megapixel image, and it's wireless N which is what you want unless you're doing some fancy POE setup.Here's a list of things you want in a good IP cam:- H.264 (unless you use software like Blue Iris to do it for you on your computer)- Viewing angle of 70 or greater- Megapixel sensor (makes a huge difference in image quality)- Wireless N or POE for ethernet runsRight now you can get cams with all of that in the $100-150 range.  There are some new ones coming out later this year and next year that should bring down the price and increase quality with all of those features.The cams usually come with basic software that may be enough for you, but if you want the best get Blue Iris (can be found on discount at Eb**).", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "WiFi Baby 2.0 - 2013 Version: Monitor & Nanny Cam DVR | Video, Audio, Alerts on iPhone, iPad, Android, Mac or PC on WiFi or 3G/4G.
