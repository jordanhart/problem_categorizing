{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Rock Solid Camera with Many Features", "Author": "Schundg \"Schundg\"", "ReviewID": "RS0I2T1FY5BKM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the Trivision NC-336W (w/o POE) and have been using it on my wireless network without any trouble at all.  It is a very well built camera.  The camera is a bit heavy but that's because it's made from quality materials.  The mount is the best and most sturdy I have found on any camera.Though this camera is an outdoor bullet camera, I have it mounted inside my garage door window to keep it hidden and therefore I am unable to use Infared night vision.  I enjoy excellent night vision using 2 (40w equivalent led bulbs in ) coach lights mounted outside my 3 garage doors.  Daytime vision is excellent (even through a garage door window).  The camera automatically adjusts to brightness/darkness.  I have had no trouble with wireless drop outs, camera failures, or any other trouble.  The camera is in my attached garage about 50' from my router which is in my home.  This camera is rock solid stable and delivers a great picture even connected to a wireless network.  Bandwidth usage is low due to video compression.  I enjoy 12 frames/second (FPS) at 1080P daytime viewing and 7 FPS @ 1080P night vision.The Trivision accepts an SD card for recording storage though I have not used that feature.  I have this camera connected to Blue Iris DVR software (Ourstanding Software) and use BI software to control motion detection sensitivity, motion masking, recording, email notifications, etc.  There are plenty of features included in this camera like email notifications, recording on trigger, motion sensing, motion masks, night vision control, IR control, Audio record, video record, SD card storage, File Transfer, and 2 way audio which requires a (not included) speaker at the camera.I have contacted Trivision support both pre and post purchase and have received outstanding support.  They are very timely (overnight, usually because they're in China) and through in their support.  I arranged for a technician to log into my camera and make some initial adjustments as this was my first camera and I had no experience whatsoever.  I contacted their support later and asked about a firmware upgrade which they sent to me.  A web site would be very helpful which they say they are creating, but I have not found it operational  as of Nov, 4, 2013.The camera is a bit pricey but you get what you pay for.  My next purchase will include the PoE feature which is not possible with the NC-336W ... Note: to get the PoE feature, you need to purchase the NC-336WP.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Outstanding, clearly the best security cameras in the world.", "Author": "Chef Bob \"Cano2\"", "ReviewID": "R3AESOP62K9R5I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After many trial and errors with cameras, I ended up spending the extra money and getting these. Boy they didn't disappoint!Setup isn't difficult, but requires at least SOME technical knowledge. Firmware upgrades are needed immediately, and you must email support to get those updates. Support is FANTASTIC with this company, despite their being in China. Usually 1-2 hours maximum to get detailed replies back. Very friendly. info@trivisiontech.com usually respond immediately, and if you email them ask for the firmware and they will email back the firmware with detailed instructions.After the firmware is updated you are ready to install them. First, some important facts;1) The cameras are IP66+ rated. Which means you can submerse them in water. They are resistant to dust, dirt, blunt force, and water. Essentially these are full military grade cameras. You do not have to be concerned where you  mount them, unlike most other cameras.2) Mounts are STURDY.. Very thick steel, able to sustain a lot of force if necessary. Unlike most flimsy camera mounts!3) Top camera shield is steel, and sits above the camera buffered by rubber knobs.4) Camera has 'seals' for all openings, including rubber plugs for screw holes!5) Camera has 'several' mounting areas underneath, so you can adjust how/where the mounting post screws in. This is a superb feature missing from most cameras.6) Camera comes with a 6db antenna, very good, and capable of incredible range, even through walls. Most cameras come with 1-3db antennas - for the record.7) SD card is mounted inside of camera - you need to unscrew the camera mousing.8) Camera junction box is sealed, mountable outside, and has romex attachments for direct home wiring, or power supply attachments!9) Night vision is STRONG, but fairly low spread, keep this in mind. It can see effectively out to almost 100 feet, but there isn't tremendous spread to the night vision.10) Camera defaults on 17.5 FPS, 1920x1080 high definition.11) TRUE high definition - and it's remarkable in quality! License place ID at over 40 feet!Some important things to consider;1) Software that this comes with is rubbish. Absolutely limited. You WILL need a third party software like Blue Iris to effectively utilize this powerful camera. Not a big deal!2) Included \"Camera Live\" software needs to be installed for true configuration, otherwise the cameras firmware overrides SOME settings in Blue Iris and other packages. For example 10FPS is really what you want, but the camera overrides Blue Iris. So you need to login to setup under Camera Live, and turn the camera down to 10FPS.To setup properly, you need to do the following;1) Connect camera directly to router/switch, and wall outlet.2) Load Camera Live, go into 'setup', and upgrade firmware with the firmware supplied by Trivision.3) Go into NETWORK aspect of Camera Live, setup Wireless to reach your network.4) Unplug everything, mount camera, plug it into power or direct wire with romex.5) Now load camera live, extra the IP address of camera, and adjust the 'settings' (such as lowering it to 10FPS)6) Install Blue Iris, it will find the camera (click plus sign).Now you are ready to go.  You can also enable P2P connection, and connect to your camera directly with the free software, and mobile apps (camera live). However this offers NO functionality for recording or anything else, but at least verifies it's all working. Now it's easy to add more cameras.There are cheaper cameras, but not cheaper with the level of resolution, night vision, durability, and configurability as this one. If you want a REAL camera, you pay $300+ for one. $100 cameras will get you frustrations, trust me on that!", "Date": "April 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "A very nice camera", "Author": "M. Garnaat", "ReviewID": "R305RFPNEOTLN5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to keep an eye on a home we purchased until we are able to move in.  I mounted the camera on a barn on the property.  I found a nice location right in the corner, under the eves so it is somewhat protected from the weather and has a nice view of the driveway and the house.  I then ran ethernet out to the barn using a powerline adapter (also works great, btw).After the physical installation, I then set about doing the software configuration.  I checked my DHCP server on the wireless router and found the IP address of the camera and then connected to the camera using a web browser from my Mac on the local network.  That all worked fine.  I changed the admin password and a variety of other settings (e.g. using digest auth rather than basic, etc.) and was very pleased with the quality of the video from the camera.  I also configured my router to create a virtual server so that the camera could be accessed using a browser from outside my LAN.I then tried to set up the iOS app but I had a lot of trouble getting the app to connect to the camera and even when it said it did, I wasn't able to see the video feed.  I suspected that my firmware might be out of date but I had difficulty finding a support web site to download updates.  I emailed the company using the email address on the camera web interface and got a prompt response which pointed me to the updated firmware.  I downloaded the rather large zip file, found the firmware for my model and updated the camera.  That all went smoothly and at that point the iPhone app started working and has continued to do so.After reading the documentation a bit more I realized that I could put an SD card in the camera and configure it to store videos there.  So, I bought a 32GB card and installed it and, sure enough, it happily stores the videos in ~ 160MB chunks and removes the oldest ones as necessary to make room for new ones.  This gives me a couple of days of videos stored on the camera.  You can also configure it to FTP the videos to a separate server so I will probably do that soon.All in all, I've been very impressed with the camera.  It works as advertised and has been very reliable.  I love being able to check the video feed on my iPhone just to make sure things are okay there.  The only complaint I have is that it would be nice if there was a web site that had firmware updates, manuals, etc.  But, at least the email support has been very responsive so no real complaints.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Easy and stable", "Author": "S. Scigliano", "ReviewID": "R2J61Q7C8CZW51", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was truly shocked at how easy this was.  I found it best setting this camera up with my iPad.  No problems.  Followed the instructions and all worked as it said... Even the wifi connection works great and it was pretty simple getting it to where I can look at the camera through the web.  The one minor drawback is the cord.  It is pretty bulky and thik till it reaches it's own control box which is 1\"x2\".  So you have either live with the little box sitting outside near your camera or drill a 1\" in diameter hole to run the plug  inside...  Beside that, bravo.  (As an FYI, I'd make sure you have a new modem and router.  I think folks may run into set up issues with old ones that do not have plug and play capabilities....  I'd get another one soon if it wasn't so darn expensive, but if I do need another one in the near future, I'd buy it again.)", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Horrible customer service", "Author": "Stone", "ReviewID": "R1UTMBQIGT8QU6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Customer service is horrible! I've now had problem with both camera's and after many months of back and forth with pin pan he told me the only way he was going to help me is if I add more stars to my review! This is total BS, guess he's unfamiliar with the term blackmail.The first camera had a reflection of the camera lens which made a ring in the picture, after trying to get ahold of customer service for weeks I had to write a bad review on amazon. Finally someone contacted me about my review. I told him about the problem and after several weeks of arguing with me they finally sent me the parts to move the camera lens closer to the glass, which I had to do myself. This did fix the problem but i think QA should have caught this before it ever left the warehouse.After a couple months the second camera won't stay running, I was able to restart and get it up and running. This kept getting more frequent and was starting to become a daily chore. Finally it wouldn't reboot at all. The company stalled long enough for my warranty to run out, then they wanted to charge me another $80 to send the camera back for a replacement. He has lost my address three times and only when I said I was going to re-do my review again with less stars did he say he would send me a new camera. Just needed my address... Company is a joke and the camera's are sub par.Use your money somewhere else and buy from a place that has good customer service.", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Considering returning", "Author": "s. pantalones \"Se\u00f1or Pantalones\"", "ReviewID": "R2TTGGON94J2GP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Hardware is high quality.

It was really nice that they had an appendix for us AT&T; Uverse subscribers on how to get the 2Wire gateway to properly pass video through.The physical camera is built tough and seems to be very well made.  The night vision capabilities of the camera are first rate.  It works really well in a dark environment.Only downside I see to it is that some of the software provided is a little \"non-intuitive\" in places, but it does work.UPDATE: one issue I found... if you want to use an SD card larger than 32Gb (like the 64Gb card Amazon recommends you buy when you order the camera), you will need to reformat it in the camera as a FAT32 file system.  Unfortunately, Windows will only do this as an exFAT file system.  You will need to delete the exFAT partition on the card and then use the formatter on the camera to reformat it as FAT32.", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "A test video I did", "Author": "micheal boyes", "ReviewID": "R1ENHDN30A19XM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Uploaded a test video using camera on WIFI and with cameras audio.

The device carries an HD symbol beside it claiming 1080P resolution and all kinds of wonderful claims. That is a blatant misrepresentation. The camera requires a Quick Time plugin to display. The quicktime plugin cannot generate even close to a High def picture. I have experimented w/ browsers, plugins and i connected the camera to both an Apple and a PC with the same disappointing results. I do not think the resolution of the camera is more than 320x 280. i have $130 cams that produce a better picture than this one does for $330. I would return if I hadn't spent a lot of time installing and attempting to get higher resolution from the cam. Plus I threw out the packaging.
