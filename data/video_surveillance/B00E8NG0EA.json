{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great system for cheap!!!", "Author": "Sebastian Morris", "ReviewID": "R2CAGUM0LAIY3V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good system that is easy to install. I had quite a bit of trouble with the 1step remote viewing. The softwear would not load, I had to call tech support. Tech support was great, they logged into my desktop and set it up for me. The night vision of these cameras is excellent!  But the mounting backets only allow for a side mount. Also the narrow 60* view could use some work and the power supply should be changed to one plug and not 3. All in all this is a great system for the money!", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$549.99", "Features": "Versatile bullet & dome camera combination\nRemote viewing on smartphone\n500GB HDD for 2 years footage\nUltra hi-res video (600TVL)\n24 IR LEDs for 65' night vision", "Name": "Defender 21186 Surveillance Cameras (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41b27FxhGgL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00E8NG0EA"}}
