I like it too, for I know when he has opened the door. The mailbox alert has not helped us yet.", "Date": "September 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worked 5 times", "Author": "Adam mitchell", "ReviewID": "R2W5HE03WU0G7C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Don't waste your money.

The most I could get was only 25'. That may be fine in an apartment or small home, but it was useless in my house.  I purchased new batteries, as the ones that came with the unit tested bad, but that made no difference in the range.

Young", "ReviewID": "RFDT4M9S8DGY8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The range on this is only about 20 feet.  This defeats the entire purpose of a wireless door annunciation product when the transmitter and receiver have to be nearly side by side to work.  I want to be alerted in my bedroom at one end of  my average size three bedroom house whenever someone enters from the garage area. It is about 50 ft distance with 2 sheetrock walls between.  The door would never alert with the receiver placed  in the bedroom.  I moved the receiver to a location in the hallway about 30 feet from the entry door transmitter with only one wall between them.  It would alert about 40% of the time - certainly not helpful!I thought maybe the battery that came with the transmitter might be weak, so I spent $4 on another of these special batteries.  It did not help.I finally moved the receiver to the family room directly in sight of the transmitter.  Yep, it works - except that I cannot hear it back in the bedroom which was the whole purpose of the purchase.In conclusion, I could only recommend this product if you live in a small studio or one bedroom apartment.", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Does not sense correctly, adhesive is worthless", "Author": "C.
