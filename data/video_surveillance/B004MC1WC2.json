Some good, some just fair, some bad. The battery life and the fire up response time to take a picture is very important.  I recently purchased 2 of these bushnell trail cams.  Both the battery life and the response time for the Bushnell are excellent.  Battery life is awesome, and the trigger time is so quick I rarely miss a picture.  I can honestly say this is the best trail cam I have ever owned.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pleased in East Texas", "Author": "Scott G Bryk", "ReviewID": "R16MO0KWXL761U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this product and am very pleased.  I've had a lot of luck with these small Bushnell cameras.  Battery life is great and trigger speed is also quite good.  For clarification, this IS the 2011 model with the field scan.  Up to 8 Meg images.  My only semi negative feedback would be that with field scan you can only set one time period, so if you are going to take images during the morning and evening periods you basically have to include the entire day or the entire night.  The entire night would definitely wear down the batteries (IR flash).  I imagine it is a simple software fix that Bushnell will put out in the future.  I own Moultries at the same price point and far prefer my Bushnells.  I simply can't choke out the cash for the Reconyx cameras.  They are entirely too pricey to have a sufficient quantity of them to try to understand the deer herd on the size property where I hunt.  I can get five Bushnells for the price of two Reconyx.  My Bushnell from last season stood the outdoor life well here in East TX (heat, rain, heat, rain...).I also bought the python lock and metal outside case...  they're kind of a pain in the rear to deal with (I'm a low irritant tolerant guy) and nothing a bolt cutter wouldn't make quick work of.  Probably not worth it unless hunting public land.Finally I searched the web pretty heavily and found the price at Amazon was the best I could do.  If you can beat it though, congrats, then I'm the chump.Regardless, I'm happy you're reading this because it means you're also excited about deer season.  God blessed this great land and you too, be safe and happy scouting!SGB", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent for hunting, not so much for surveillance (mod 119436C)", "Author": "J. Smith", "ReviewID": "R3GVQQZY709871", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, this review is for the 119436C model.I bought this camera for surveillance at my business (kind of a bridge-the-gap measure until I can get an effective surveillance system installed.)  The camera takes good color pics in the daylight, and good black and white pics at night.  The consistently effective range of this is around 50 feet, with occasional pick ups at 80 feet.  Part of the reason for this is most likely the clean background area, anything moving through the area is \"framed\" by dirt, no moving bushes or background noise that will cause false triggers or interference.The pictures are good, but I have noticed some slight distortion away from the center of the pictures, a slight fish eye effect.My main problem with this unit is that the led's do glow a noticeable red color which is pretty noticeable in dark environments.  The flash catches the eye kind of like something flitting by.  I plan to move this unit to a more lit area to compare the flash glow and see if it is still as noticeable.I rate this at 5 stars in spite of my led visibility because this camera is designed for game images and videos.  It was not designed to be a business surveillance tool, I just wanted to list the drawbacks of this unit for those who might be considering it for the same purpose.Edit to add:  I moved this unit to a more lit location and it does help with the glow noticeability, but it is still there.  I purchased the Bushnell Black LED trail camera (# 119466C) and am more pleased with the flash performance.  The LED glow is almost nonexistent in pitch black conditions on the black led camera.", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "2011 Model - Best trailcam on the market", "Author": "JP Vic \"Bee Guy\"", "ReviewID": "RWLISOM5AKXC2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "II have three trailcams from Bushnell, two earlier models and this new one.  This one is the 2011 model that has audio (not really important), a timer to take a picture (field scan), and can handle 32GB memory cards.I also own three other trail cams from Moultrie a M-60, I-40 and a D-50.  I had a cuddleback two years ago, and it worked fine, but it got destroyed (tree fell on it).  I do not own the new Moultrie M-100, which seems very similar to this Bushnell, but this is the first year for the M-100 and I bet they will have software issues.  This is the 3rd year for Bushnell and they have this camera dialed-in very well.The biggest issue with my older Moultrie cams is battery life.  They need feed 6 D cells about once a month.  The price of the batteries start to add up, but mostly the issue is going out to a dead trailcam and wondering what pictures you missed.  A battery life of 1-year for just 8 AA is great.Aside from battery life, all these trailcams seem to do the work well.  Basically I want to take a picture of game when it walks by and they all do that.  I'm not going to publish my pictures in National Geographic, I mostly want to count horns and find patterns.  All do that just fine for me.I've stuck different models of trail cams on the same tree and compared results.  It's weird, sometimes the Bushnell shoots and sometimes the Moultrie shoots but most of the time they both shoot when game walks by.I like the 2 year warranty from Bushnell and have used it.  The first year model had issues, and I returned it- they then sent me a new current year model.  I had issues with a Moltrie cam once and tried to get warranty work, but they did not honor the warranty and returned my camera.  I bought from an on-line dealer they did not like.  ( I will only buy from major retailers now)I do like the nighttime flash color pictures from my Moultrie D-50, as it is nice to see in color.  All nighttime trailcams that use IR flash come out in black and white.  Flash vs IR is a personal thing, but in the end I'm counting horns and B&W; is fine for my needs.The biggest thing I hate about the I-40 &M-60; Moultrie is the fact that it is not easy to swap the SD card.  I sometimes like to check my cams every day and it's a real pain to swap SD cards.  On the Bushnell it's a piece of cake.The biggest thing I hate about the Bushnell is that programming in the field under low light conditions is difficult.  The screen is hard to read and the buttons are impossible.  I find I need a small flashlight unless it is a bright sunny day.Some trailcams come with a `viewer'.  Personally I think it is a waste, save your money.  If you need to view pics in the field, most all cameras (the cameras you use to take pictures of the kids) that use a SD chip will display trailcams pics,  and so do smartphones.  In my trailcams I use microSD with an adaptor and then plug the microSD into my blackberry for field viewing (If I can't wait to get back to the house).Summary, I've been real happy with my Bushnell trailcam.  I buy one new cam every year and for 2011 bought this one.  I did look at the Moultrie M-100 and I think it would have worked fine for my needs, but it was a bit more $$ than the Bushnell and the fact that the Moultrie is a first year model made me stay with the Bushnell this year.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Georgejr", "ReviewID": "RQS24OI6HIRHH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Picked up this unit based on good reviews and a great warranty. Comes with free software to scan thru 1000's of pics to find motion (great when using field scan mode) and comes with free software for a buck scoring software (I haven't used this yet).  The Scouting assistant software is great tool.  Currently I have it set to 5MP, 1 sec delay, high sensitivity, Field scan turned on for 6am thru 7:15pm.  After being on for just over a week used about 1 GB with these settings.First location was in the middle of woods in a thick tall grass trail.  Worked great facing NW direction.  Plenty of canopy so I wasn't worried about direct sun.  New spot is facing direct N (most state this is best if you can face north to avoid direct sun wash-out of the pics).  At our house I tested (I highly recommend this to get used to the camera) facing south and south west w/o any problems with only 2 trees in our yard.  Took great pics of cars and people in the neighborhood.  I did have some low light blurring of pics till I updated the firmware as noted below.I would recommend the following.  Sony Envelope rechargeable batteries (new ones have even more charge cycles and have great life (85% of capacity after a year  and spend a few bucks on the BC-700 Lacrosse charger or something similar.  This charger took my Energizer rechargeable and gave them new life.  Charges each cell separately and doesn't rely on just a timer. Our Digital camera went from 3 weeks between trying to take a pic and having dead batteries to lasting 4-6 months with about the same amount of use.  Old energizer charger cooked the batteries I am guessing and the storage life was non existent, new charger they are working much better, but do loose over time so I would not use with this camera due its low consumptions and possible to go seasons on 1 charge.Just ordered a 16 GB memory card and plan on trying videos later this fall to watch turkey patterns (Time lapse and Trigger can be set to use video, you get either pics or video but you can't do one of each).  I purchased a Scandisk class 4 and MicroSD size so I can also view on my phone (Micro to SD adapter used in the unit).  Class 4 card is probably over-kill but the price was not much different then class 2 (Higher is faster  Be careful of fake memory cards, If you write a review make sure to know the seller if you are sure it was not a fake.  Amazon has frustration free on the MicroSD and you can be assured it is not fake.  I've read several reviews where memory cards were the problem or low battery life was tied to it on this and other trail cams.Note Bushnell has a 2010 and 2011 firmware update.  Review your Ser # to see if you need to update it.  Fixed blurry pics I had in night vision before I ran the update.************  Update OCT 5th 2012:  Camera going strong and what a great tool.  I've been just using only motion this fall so far (corn still on fields so I will wait to use time lapse to track turkeys at a distance for late fall turkeys.  I've found mounting the camera higher on the tree and angling down (I use parts of branches but you could saw a few wood shims too) works great for night shots to avoid triggering camera and only seeing eyes of deer out past 50 yrds.  I did this really to make sure bucks don't try to rub camera but found the additional nice feature, as gun deer gets closer I will mount lower and on a tree overlooking a field to track as much activity as I can.  Right now just want good pics of deer within 40 yrds.  If you want to see these shots keep the camera 6' or less height, but I'm at 9 ft angled down using a ratchet tie down to hold camera and getting great pics including a 8 min fight on a huge buck and nice mature buck.  I use a gator and stand on the bed to swap cards and if needed batteries.  I tend to swap batteries when I see one bar on set-up as I have found these rechargeables do last a long time.  I have it set to take 3 pics at each trigger and 1 sec between shots so I get a old time video which is great to watch each camera shot (Camera has video but I still haven't used it yet as I can go months between getting out to the camera the 3 pics / trigger allows me to see enough info on where they are going and what they are doing).  I've had over 9,000 shots on one set of the rechargeables and on a 16 GB card which had space to spare yet.  It was still taking shots which was due in part to time lapse mode taking most during the day I was using in the spring to pattern turkeys (LOVE this feature).  I have now purchased a second set of rechargeables and a second memory card to make swapping out easier.  I would note to be careful changing batteries as I have dropped one on two occasions and often I am swapping late at night which can make finding the battery a bit difficult.  I have found them but use one hand to push and pop battery and your other hand to cover bottom of box incase they don't stay in your hand.  I find if I miss them they hit the bottom of the camera box and down they go.", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "PERFECT for BACKYARD WILDLIFE SURVEILLANCE", "Author": "StopBreedingParrots

caught this litte mouse snooping around the back of the neighbor's garage during the night. I prefer taking videos to see which way my nightly visitors go and how they behave. I've increased the length of the videos to 35-40 seconds which does eat into battery life a bit.  I have the cam set on high sensitivity and, on that setting, the Bushnell has picked up critters as small as this mouse in addition to raccoons, a possum, cats, chipmunks, birds and squirrels (during the day). Daytime videos could be a bit less grainy, sound could use some improvement and there is no moon phase or temperature stamp, only date & time. However, the camera takes FANTASTIC photos (I posted some at the top of the page when I had the camera set up to monitor the taking down of our huge old maple tree that carpenter ants had entirely hollowed out).My main reasons for deciding on the Bushnell were that it can be set up on a tripod to move around easily to different areas of the yard, that it has sound and that it picks up tiny creatures which a lot of the others do NOT (I tested others next to the Bushnell and they failed the small animal test)! So, I'm very happy with this hunt cam for my purpose of seeing who snoops thru my yard at night!!! :>)NOTE re the VIDEO: Use FULL screen when watching the video -- the mouse is so tiny. Also, when it disappears behind the garage for a second, it comes right back.The Bushnell was about 4-6 feet from the mouse and approx. a foot off the ground.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "outstanding", "Author": "A Customer", "ReviewID": "R1EEBLQYV2G72Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "best game camera i've owned.  made my own base for it and set up in tree about 20 feet. takes awesome photos. very clear. use 4g sd card that holds lots of photos.  would buy this again. battery life great. had a moultrie before, did not like.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Elsen", "ReviewID": "R1LJP6PSAKVU0Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the 4th bushnell trohpy cam I own.

I wanted to see how many cats were coming to the feeding station that still needed to be neutered/spayed.I've only used it the last two nights, and I did get a lot of great videos.On the SD card this morning, there were 55 videos, and over half of them were false triggers and just videos of the food bowl with no animals - I do have it set on high sensitivity, and I think the neighbor's hanging flower basket might have been setting it off.I was also missing images of cats that I knew for a fact had come by, but the camera had not picked them up.One thing to mention, in night vision mode, I can't tell apart the orange and white cats.  The black and white images make them look all white.  What I CAN see in night vision mode, however, is if the cats are ear-tipped (the clinic clips the tip of their left ear when they neuter so you can quickly tell).when the night vision is triggered, you can see red glowing from the LEDs, so if you want a spy cam, get one of the others.  For my use, the red is fine.I haven't tried the still mode yet, just the video mode.  I'll edit my review later when I play with the settings some more.The description says that the batteries last up to a year.  I'm assuming that this is for still photos only.  I had the video length set to 60 seconds, and the sensitivity on the motion detection to \"high\" and I got about and hour a night of moths flying by, and the batteries only lasted 3 days (I only had 4, not 8 at the time).  The thing started acting up, too, and fresh batteries made it work fine. I've adjusted my settings, and now the batteries are lasting a little bit longer.Edit:I've attempted the still picture mode several times, and it doesn't seem to work right.  I got one picture of my husband walking by, and several .jpg files that were 0 kb.  I know he was out there multiple times, and he saw several animals and that was it.

The worst thing I discovered is that the \"invisible\" IR flash is actually quite visible as dim red.  It doesn't really flash either.  It's more like they turn on for a couple of seconds.  I think the exposure time at night is roughly 1/30 to 1/5 sec.  So if your subject is moving, they will be blurry.  In day time the exposure is shorter, so,there's not much motion blur. At night, the pictures are all black and white, and the resolution seems to drop to about 1MP even though the image size is still 8MP.  Also beware the actual image sensor is 5MP, so the 8MP setting is basically a lie.  It does provide a better picture though, by virtue of a lower compression ratio.  I am impressed with the clarity of daytime photos, however.  They are far better than what a video camera produces, and very sharp all the way down to the pixel (at 5MP).

I am returning the item only because \"my\" camera was real junk, for sure. I had read hundreds of the reviews on Amazon, as well as, those on the internet dealing with these cameras. I have a great deal of experience with this Bushnell Cam, so I understood how to set the camera parameters up and how to use all the features, since they have the same buttons, etc. I bought this camera because it was the cheapest Bushnell that had the \"non flash\" PIR that allows for more sleath that won't scare away animals. My experience was using my brother's for nearly 3 months of daily use last year. I liked it so much I wanted one. This one has an 8 MP camera, which  took great clear photos on my brother's camera, and the videos were fantastic during the day/color recordings.You can see from the reviews, here at Amazon, most people got great results with their cameras. I was bothered by the fact that there were any bad reviews, except for possible DOA problems, since I had such a great experience with my brother's camera. I checked the internet out thoroughly on this camera and found that there were atrocious reviews as well. After reading hundreds it seemed that about 20% hated this camera and 80 % loved it. This is unofficial, but certainly left doubts in my mind. I hoped that I would get one of the good ones like my brother. I've never won the lottery, but I figured I could beat the odds, so I bought one of these. I lost the lottery, again! Dang!I installed the 8 batteries and the SD card, then used the MENU to format the card. Worked fine.I set the camera to the highest resolution, 8 MP, and the highest sensitivity so it would take photos even if a chipmunk walked by.I set the date and time and used the strap to attach to a tree facing my compost heap. I opened the console door in order to set it from the OFF to the ON mode. Three batteries fell out. My brother's battery compartment held them in tightly. What changed? The battery holders are weak and when attached verically to a tree they tend to fall out when you open the console door, which you have to do, if you want to turn it ON. No problem, next time I will put tape across all 8 batteries.I danced around during the light of a very bright day and left it there for hours. My wife later put some scraps in the compost. In the evening I went out to check out what the camera had taken. I was extremely disappointed. I found pictures of myself from 10 feet out, only. These were during a bright afternoon. All the other dancing around from 75 feet and inward, was in vain... the sensor never recorded anything passed 10 feet. But, the worst was the quality. Even though it was a very bright day, the pictures were nearly black with only my white shoes and faintly viewable face shining through the murkiness, and it was highly flushed with no definition. This could never record a chipmunk even if he were 3 feet tall. This was nothing like my brother's camera when I tried similar tests. During my research on the internet I found that this was the biggest complaint... really dark pictures and an inability to sense movement during the day. Maybe the camera needed a driver update????I did a search and found that the camera might, could, maybe, perhaps, need an update, but I'd never know because there is no way to check the version installed in the camera. All I could do is get the latest update and see if it improves things. I found the latest update for my model and installed it using the SD card, and was hopeful it would solve the problem. The camera accepted the update.  I lost the lottery, again. Dang!!!The daylight shots, in midday broad daylight were garbage... all washed out, and dark. I thought maybe the gain was wrong, so I put the photos in my image software and drove the gain up, brightness up, etc. It brightened the picture and at the same time washed it out. It was indeed a horrible picture to begin with and no software would fix it. The dusk and dawn pictures were not usable and at a bad resolution considering it was supposed to be 8 MP. The pictures are worse than the cheapest digital camera one could buy.Unfortunately, these dusk and dawn times are when many animals are most active.I tried the camera in video mode during the bright day. It was only able to record me moving around when I got within 12 feet of the camera. My brother's camera could pick me up during the day at over 40 feet. On top of that, the video was horrible by any video standard.... smeary, and dark.I tried the camera at night and it worked as expected, and did a great job at black and white photography even at long distances at night.I used the FieldScan which essentially takes pictures over and over at a given location at prescribed intervals. This feature worked, but with bad dark pictures, who cares???CONCLUSION:What I learned was that all these cameras, although they are advertised to be the same, are not. The cameras are made in China. I had, in the past, researched Chinese production methods. Like most companies around the world, Chinese companies purchase parts and circuit boards from numerous other companies to reduce costs and increase profits. All items, although advertised to be the same, are made from a hodge-podge of items from different vendors. The only problem with most Chinese companies is they have no quality control, so products are slapped together, assuming everything is fine, and then passed on to the consumer without regard, and left to the consumer to filter out the garbage. I became one of these filters with this product. This item was in no way comparable to the other Busnell camera of my brother's and could not be made to be, in the slightest, similar in quality. Externally, it was identical, but that is all.But, based on reviews at Amazon and other sources on the internet, it is possible to get a great Bushnell camera. My brother even has one.My ultimate conclusion is that you take your chances and join the lottery. They are in favor of a good camera, but don't be surprised if you get a bad one... it is possible. I am not the type to forgive or forget, so my personality says I will look somewhere else, unfortunately. Bushnell used to be a good optic brand for me.ONE GOOD THING:Thank goodness for Amazon's easy return policy... I couldn't live without it, and it is great business practice. At least, if you get one of the bad cameras, you can return it with very little hassle which I am doing right now.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best on the market--versatile and inexpensive", "Author": "G.

The Trophy Cam line has been the best performer by far. If you encounter short battery life, or too many or too few pictures, or pictures out of frame, I would advise changing your settings--As a wildlife biologist I use a variety of trail Cams, and these are by far the most versatile. I use them for everything from voles, to birds, to herps and large mammals.Just be prepared to spend a few days testing the settings--don't set it up for a week or two the 1st time and go back to see what happened. Also, I highly recommend the Ultimate Lithium batteries. They last a LOT longer--months longer than regular alkaline batteries. I have some high traffic areas that batteries last about 6 weeks in, but as I use high sensitivity on a number of cameras, I go through them pretty fast even in low traffic areas. Using Normal settings, 2 pics per shot, with a 10 second interval I get a good 6-11moonths out of a set of the UL batteries by Energizer. Just be sure that you don't have tall grasses or waving branches in the field of view--you will get thousands of pictures of plant life--not very exciting. Also, the camera does not \"know\" when the SD card is full so if you are in a high traffic area or using high sensitivity, it will continue to take pictures even though the card is full---wasting the batteries (another reason to test it out for a night or 2 in order to get the settings correct for your plans).

The quality of the videos that it takes and the photos are great and there are multiple settings for quality (megapixels, etc).It's easy to setup (keep it close to the ground for the best results.

I've had this for a year now and have used it through all seasons without a problem.  The batteries last a good period of time even during the winter which is a huge plus!  Night vision works very well as well.  I like that you can change the sensitivity settings so if there is a lot grass, tree limbs in the photo it won't be snapping 4,000 photos every time the wind blows.Very easy to swap memory cards which is another huge plus!So far I have captured plenty of wildlife; Turkeys, deer, rodents, bear (make sure you dont have any feed/food scent on the cam or you will be sorry), coyotes, foxes, etc.Overall I couldn't be happier!I have noticed on rare occasion that when you open the device to get the memory card, the screen won't turn on.

I took the default settings for day one.Day1. When I got home, I could not wait to check my photos.  I pulled the SD card and popped it in my PC.

She made several more trips during the night ensuring I did not see anything interesting and the cam took photos every time.  Who knew that my dog who gets fed every morning and evenening would like dry shelled corn?  During the day, I had photos of my dog as well as crows, cardinals and blue jays.  On the birds I could only see the tops of their heads in many cases... had the bait too close to the camera!Day2. I adjusted the settings to my liking.  Set it up for taking 3 photos on each trigger, set the field scan to every 30 minutes, and to trigger only once per minute.  I moved the corn about 15 feet away from the cam.  When I got home yesterday, once again I had to check the camera first thing...could not wait!  Well you guessed it...during the night there was my dog eating corn again and this time with some of her neighborhood dog friends.  The other dogs did not eat the corn, but just kinda hung out.  I had about 100 dog photos, a couple of cats had wondered by, and three photos of one deer about 50 feet away that was almost out of the infrared flash range, but still very clear even if kind of dark.  I had one animal that blazed by so fast I could not make out what it was.  According to the manual, I could lower the resolution to 3MP to catch fast animals, but I'd rather have the bigger, better photos.  During the day yesterday I had crows, doves, cardinals and blue jays.  Once again it captured them without a hitch only this time I could see their whole bodies because they were at the better distance from the cam.  Also, thanks to the field scan I could see that nobody had came in my yard etc.  It's a great way to view a large area without requiring a trigger.Day3.  I cannot wait to get home!I hope this review helps someone.  It is my first field cam, so I cannot really compare it to any other model but I do LOVE it so far.

I set it to take one photo when the motion detector is tripped and then another shot 1 second later and a third 1 second after that. This seems to be a good setting for getting the most images. Often, the sensor trips before the subject is actually within lens range and this setting ensures I almost always get a shot of the animal. Since most of the animals are on the move, it may be just a nose that is within sensor range. The multiple shots option is great.

The day time photos of squirrels/birds/deer are great and I think it will make a good security camera when gone for a few days.  The night time photos are pretty good but if too close the flash washes the scene out some what.  It also makes the eyes of the animals glow.  I miss understood the model I ordered and it does not have a viewing screen for the photos.  We take the SD card out and view it on the TV or Computer.  No soft ware needed.  Download the ones we want. It uses 4-8 AA batteries and the menu is fairly simple.  However I am unable to get it to erase the SD card in the unit.  Which it is suppose to do.

Let's say it takes 10 pictures, it names them something like \"img0001\" to \"img0002\" (not the actual name, but the indexing is the point).  The problem is, say you copy the pictures onto your computer or tablet and delete them off the trailcam.  When the camera starts taking pictures again it starts back over at 1, so the new image is called \"img0001\" again.  If you want to copy that picture onto your computer or tablet too, then you either have to rename it or put it in a separate directory since the names are identical.  I'm not sure how big a problem this is for some people, but this camera was a gift for my father who isn't very technologically advanced, and this adds a level of complexity to managing the pictures that is just unnecessary.All in all though, a strong 4 stars - if it wasn't for the file naming thing, it would be a 5 star trailcam.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bushnell Trophy Cam", "Author": "Old Timer \"Old Timer\"", "ReviewID": "R1XF50NWLQZ2F5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have four of the 2009 models which have some special features that are no longer offered.

The range is quite good, our camera captured animals that were about 20 yards or so from the camera, even at night. There is no sound from the camera that I could detect when it is taking pictures and the only visual signal is a weak red light from the infrared detector. Animals don't seem to be bothered by it in any way, based on the pictures we saw. It's certainly been fun to see what walks through the yard at times when we are not there or asleep.

There is no indicator that clearly tells you that the camera is working once the case is closed. You can step in front of it and look for the dim red light from the detector, but it's not foolproof. That means that you may come back to check your images and find that the camera was not actually on. Not such a big problem for us but not so good if you want to leave the camera for an extended time somewhere and come back after a month or so and there are no pictures. It helps to tape the batteries down. (2) There is no easy way to check that the camera is capturing the field you want it to. You have to set it up, walk in front of it, maybe at different distances, then take out the memory card, check the images and check if this is what you wanted to see. This can be time-consuming until you have it right and really depends on the area and what kind of critters you expect to see.I have never used any other trail camera so I don't know if other manufacturers have addressed these issues but overall I would recommend this camera and did not regret buying it at all.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Our second Bushnell Trophy Cam", "Author": "femme du nord", "ReviewID": "R2JG4UITD2PO38", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We use these cams at our cabin in northern MN and have captured many interesting animals.

I can say the night time videos are much better than the night time photos. Motion blur is a problem with photos at close range at night if the subject is on the move...(motion blur is the worst at 12 feet or less.) The night videos on the other hand look great. No blur. Daytime photos are pretty good too. You can easily make out details in the photos. I am using the 8MP setting for photos. LED's on the camera glow red when they are on, so you can see the camera at night and all of the animals I filmed seemed to be interested in the camera to some degree when it was taking photos or videos at night. The motion sensor can be triggered farther than 45 feet. I pointed it towards a roadway which was about 60 feet away and it triggered every time a car passed.The menu screen is kind of OLD SCHOOL and the buttons work but look junky. I think this could be improved. The up, down, left, right buttons are in a single row not in the shape of their wording. I would have placed the buttons like tradition devices where you have an up button on top, a down button on the bottom, the left button on the left and the right button on the right with the OK button in the middle.....duh! Their layout works but its 1990's looking and slightly confusing to use. I would expect more ease of use in a 2011 model. The menu is very simple to use and navigate once you get used to the dumb button configuration. You can not review photos on this models screen. You can attach it to a TV with the included cord or your computer, also with the included cord but I prefer to use multiple SD cards and just swap them out when I visit the camera. Trust me you don't want to have to disconnect the camera from a tree everytime you want to see what is on it.

Every game camera, with perhaps a few recent (and expensive) exceptions, seems to have quality and performance issues.  This one, at least, is still going, and gets decent photos much of the time.I've stuck with still photos, in bursts of 3, and high motion sensitivity most of the time, so this review won't evaluate the video capabilities - though I may give them a try some day.  I run it a 5 MP, which appears to be the \"sweet spot\" in quality for this camera, I believe that the 8 MP photos are oversampled  (going from memory here!)A common failing of game cameras is taking night photos in the early twilight or day photos in the late twilight - thus giving massively over or under exposed photos, just at the time most animals are active.  This one has only done that a couple of times (another popular brand makes a RULE of mis-exposing such photos!).It is generally out behind the house, sitting on the ground and pointed up the mountain slope toward a large boulder, as there is a game trail just this side of that boulder.  There is the issue of lots of false exposures on very windy days, where the swaying of the creosote bushes trigger it - but I like the high sensitivity to catch small animals at some distance, so just delete the extra photos.  That only happens once every few weeks (there aren't many bushes right there to begin with).I live in the Mohave desert, so heat, not cold, is the issue here.  So far, it has held up to the heat OK, though I've avoid exposing it to the sun during the blast-furnace days of summer.  It has been out in several days of rain and drizzle - again with no ill effects.You do lose sensitivity during the heat (which the instructions indicate).  When everything is hot, the heat of an animal just doesn't stand out to the sensor.  In sub-100 degree temperatures, maximum sensitivity gets the job done - though nothing like when the temperature is lower and much better range for smaller animals is common - but this is going to be an issue for most any IR sensor game camera.Similarly, the IR feature is a mixed bag, as with most all of these cameras.  Overexposed on the close ones, underexposed on the far ones, and blurry if there is any significant movement at all.  I don't think any reasonably priced game camera avoids these issues (though they do make a few flash units that take color flash photos at night - to the consternation of the animals photographed, I'm sure!  Blurring on motion of the night photos is the biggest issue, and it is certainly an issue.  I haven't looked carefully to see if other cameras shorten the exposure enough to help in that area.I get photos of passing quail all the time, occasionally a dove or cactus wren.  Occasionally a rabbit (desert cotton-tail - the jack rabbits are seen nearby, but not right here, even on the mountain for some reason).  A local bobcat has been photographed both night and day.  We got a night shot of a kit fox - I've never seen one around here, but they obviously are.One of the weaknesses of these cameras is their shutter delay.  This one is proud of its short delay, but there are better (and worse) ones.  Where I have it sitting, a lot of animals pass very close to it.  For fast moving ones, all you get is the tail in one photo and nothing in the next two of the 3 shot burst.  Coyotes are usually fast movers, so they are blurred (at night) and often only a tail or hind-quarter is seen.  Similarly road runners - I get the distinctive tail, if anything.  Bobcats, rabbits, mountain sheep, many birds, you get the whole critter, often in all three shots.  For night shots, the click of the IR filter being retracted will often attract their attention and you get a nice \"posed\" shot with them looking toward the camera.  That, and perhaps the dim glow of the IR, seems to attract their attention, but not scare them away.  Works for the bobcat and rabbit, but not for the coyotes or foxes.Battery life has been \"OK\".  It is on its second set of batteries (that I can recall), and I only put in 4 at a time.  With the heat, putting in all 8 might not help much with longevity (as it should), since the heat may kill them as fast as the current drain.  One irritation: replacing the 4 batteries causes loss of date and time, requiring it to be reset.  I'll experiment with temporarily adding batteries up to 8 before replacing the first 4 to see if that avoids that minor hassle.  (Whether a warning about that is in the manual, I don't recall.)At least the menu and controls aren't too difficult.  Between the simple graphic button labels and a little experimentation, they are quickly re-mastered each time they are required, without consulting the manual.Photo reliability has been so-so.  Every once in a while I get a partial photo (top half or 2/3 only), or an unreadable photo.  Once, I had to do a \"repair\" on the directory structure of the SD card in Windows 7 to get it to display the photos.  Obviously, there are occasional glitches in the writing of a photo, with bad photos or even a messed up directory entry resulting.  So far, that has only been a minor irritation - resulting in one photo of a group of 3 being bad every great once in a while.I bring in the camera and download photos every week or two (it is right behind the house, I could do it daily if I wanted).  It is a bit of a chore to go through the false wind photos, all the quail photos, etc., and looking carefully at each one for some small animal not immediately apparent in the background.  Nearly every time however, we are rewarded with a nice photo or two of some rarely seen animal.This isn't a great game camera - and Bushnell has already brought out new models with significant claimed improvements.  However, for the price (I paid $140, which is still the current Amazon price), it may be about as good as you're going to get.  (At least as of earlier in 2013, when I bought it).If you want a game camera for the back yard, to get decent quality photos, in a variety of lighting situations, of not too rapidly moving animals, at a \"reasonable\" price, this one is a good choice.  For more demanding situations (fast moving game, very difficult lighting, critical uses like isolated hard-to-reach hunting locations), I'd want something more reliable taking and recording photos, quicker on the shutter, etc. - and I'd end up paying a lot more for it.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice.

By the date stamps on those, it seems this thing lasted about 6 months (it died several months ago).When I put an SD card in, the other memory no longer showed up. But either way, the interface into the device and the card seem to be fine. I tried to trigger some photos, but nothing doing there. Also, there was no DCIM directory created on the SD card. So, I guess the brains of this thing are fried, but the power supply and interface are fine.Too bad. I kind of liked it, but I guess I will try something else or see if a more invasive postmortem can find anything (unlikely, but nothing to lose)....

Settings go higher but with the huge card size it accepts its not an issue. *gb card will get you 7500 images on 8mp resolution and over an hour of video. Trigger sensitivity detects small critters like mice as well.Cool features:  Field scan is very awesome. One thing I did not know til purchase was that the trigger is still active during field scan. This means that if any critter walks in the detection zone between the one minute intervals (minimum) you get a photo.  Audio with video is nice!Overall: a great tiny (open palm sized) camera packed with big camera flavor. I would like to see a flash version in the future but for now I use the Covert Reveal Flash (also on amazon). The trigger speed is on the lower side of the spectrum in trail cam world. If you want faster triggers you have to pay more for the reconyx or cuddeback attack, though proper angles and deployment can overcome short organism exposure to the trigger. Also remember for the price of the faster cams you can have more of these meaning more coverage vs faster triggers. In the end its personal preference and budget.

When improperly set, a tall weed blowing in the wind sets it off, or it does not go off at all.

Although I will lose 8 of the 40 leds and will also lose the widescreen capability, Mike at Bushnell Tech Service says that the 119477c is a much better camera than the 119467. Mike said that the camera isn't really designed to use a DC adapter, that most people who want a plug-in power source use a 6 volt rechargeable adapter, powered by a solar panel; he said that these are available at Cabela's retail store but not online. I recommend that no-one should buy the old 119467 model.ORIGINAL POST:  Bushnell represents that the camera powers optionally with DC power. When you call them up they say that providing the DC power out port is the extent of their responsibility; that they don't supply the DC power adapter. However, they don't spec a DC power adapter in the owner's manual, but rather a *connector* only, not an adapter at all; and the connector they spec has to be soldered onto an adapter! I tried to get a Radio Shack adapter, but to get the 6 volts and the B plug, you have to get their switchable adapter, which only has plugs which have a 90 degree turn in them -- they don't work in the port on the camera because you have to have a straight-in plug. Prefer rechargeable batteries? They won't work either, according to Bushnell's online FAQ! Get ready to use tons of AA batteries, as there is no \"real\" DC power supply or rechargeable battery option available.

Now it's out of warranty and I am out of luck.The trouble I have with the Bushnell's seem to be poor hardware/software interface.  I was skeptical right away when I first saw the cheap three-way switch inside the camera and I was right.  It is very sloppy and often slips past the point you want it into another setting.  I have had all sorts of trouble with the cheap pushbuttons that are supposed to control the menu.  Perhaps they do or maybe the switches are bad or perhaps the software is poor.  No way for me to tell or for me to fix it.  Even while these cameras are in warranty it costs me money for shipping and handling to return them under \"Warranty\".The battery life is very good however it doesn't do any good when the camera itself is totally unreliable.  It sure does take good pictures and you better enjoy the one you get because you probably won't get many more before it breaks and you have to spend $$ to get it serviced.Once that is done you hop back on the bandwagon . . .a few more pictures (maybe) and it's back for more costly repairs.Bushnell Trail Cam?

This inhibited our ability to identify tiger individuals because you have to see their stripe pattern. It also makes photos rarely suitable for media use, or showing off to your friends.The nighttime photos had the same problem, burry if the animal is moving at all.Both these problems are due to slow shutter speed. Their new cameras have an options for faster shutter speeds at night, but this of course then leads to darker photos, since you're letting in less light to the sensor. HOWEVER, dark day and night photos can be easily brought back to life in Photoshop or another (cheaper) photo editing program.

The quality of the photos is also very nice even set at the 5MP setting, night photos are good and clear as long as the animals are standing pretty still. I also like the fact that it is fairly water resistant, we've had some serious rain/wind here and water has not penetrated the case, temperatures have also dipped below 20F and it's held up with no issues.My one complaint is that there is nothing holding the batteries in place so that if you close the camera up, get ready to mount it and then handle it a bit too rough the batteries can pop out of place and now you have a non-operating camera which also clears the time/date setting.

This is also not the first trail camera that I have owned and currently own two others (another one of these bushnells and a bone collector hd). This camera does all that it says that it will do, but you do have to have some common sense. For example, don't point it directly east or west or all of your dawn and dusk photos will be dark (which is a major issue if you are using this camera for primarily deer as I do).In the 2.5 years that I have owned and been actively using this camera I have only changed the batteries twice. The first time was after 6 months because it kept taking photos of the wind moving brush (sensitivity was too high). And the second time was about a year ago. I keep my cameras out year round, which means that the second set of 8 batteries lasted an incredible 18 months or so.I bought this camera primarily for the hd video and 8mp photos. I have not been disappointed. Lots of people tend to leave negative feedback about trail cameras when they get pictures that are blurry. This happens when the animal moves right as the shutter goes off, just the same with any other camera. The video has always been flawless for me and very helpful in deciding when to hunt or not hunt an area.The only reason that I did not rate this 5 stars is because occasionally (and I don't know why) when I check the cam after having it out for 2-3 weeks it will have 2-4 days randomly missing like it just skipped those days. It is usually during the nighttime hours. I have not called bushnell on this yet.

The photo quality is very good in daylight. 8MP looks bright and sharp to me. I can see whiskers at several yards. At night, (black and white) the quality is lower and it can get a little fuzzy with flash reflection from the target if the target is close. The red night flash is very discrete.  The trigger is plenty fast enough for any wildlife I want to photograph at any distance I require. It functioned perfectly in bitter cold, wet snow and in the blazing sun. I love the field scan mode. Careful, that means LOTS of photos. I now understand how nice a built in laser pointer aiming device would be. Oh well, I just practice a bit, double check and aim it carefully.  To look at photos in the field I bring an Ipad and a small apple SD adapter for the chip. If I had a smart phone it would be even more slick though I like the large images on the Ipad.

Meling \"Habitat guy\"", "ReviewID": "R83T1I0POZECU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We live adjacent to a national park in southern Arizona, amidst a variety of wildlife.  After a neighbor showed a video of his animal visitors, I decided to get the Bushnell.I pondered pretty heavily which Bushnell to purchase.  The main issue for me was whether to purchase the model with the blacked-out infrared flash.  Some folks mentioned the blacked-out flash was less distracting to the critters.  I decided to go the cheap route and got this one instead.  I can attest that the infrared flash is barely noticeable, and that the critters don't seem to mind at all.We strapped the unit to the trunk of a tree adjacent to a watering trough in our front yard.  It's about ten feet from the house to the water.It's almost the high point of our day when we pull the SD memory card from the unit each day, plug it into the laptop, and look to see who visited in the previous 24 hours!  The daytime pictures are great, with good resolution and colors.  The night-time pictures are still good, but black and white.  The best critters come at night.Set-up of the unit was very easy.  It's also very weather tight.  My only objection thus far is that from the time you turn the unit ON, you only have 10 seconds before it starts taking pictures.  It's hard to close the two snaps on the cover in that short period.The flash carries much further than I would have guessed.  In my case, the unit is just a few feet from the water, so there is plenty of light.  I'd prefer to put the Bushnell a bit further away, but lack a sturdy tree at the optimal distance.I put a 32gb SD card in it, reasoning that I'm sometimes gone for weeks.  I recently returned from a 6 week trip to find over 3500 pictures. I had set the unit to take 3 pictures each time motion is detected.  After eliminating lots of bird and ground squirrel pictures, I found some great pictures of deer, javalina, coyotes, and bobcats.A friend purchased a less expensive unit from a different manufacturer.  It is MUCH larger.  I really prefer this smaller unit, as it is less visible.I would certainly purchase this unit again, and would recommend it to others!", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "M.

I have been hunting deer for a long time, but I never knew exactly what was in the woods I was hunting in.  I set this camera up near a corn pile and I was amazed at what I saw.  It takes amazing pictures in high resolution and you can set it to take pictures at different time intervals.  It will also take short videos.  The case allows you to leave it outside year around and it takes great pictures at any time of day.  I do recommend buying at least a 4GB memory card for it because depending on the setting, it may take a lot of pictures.  For example, I have it taking 2 pictures each time it detects motion and I have taken over 700 pictures in a week.

Photos are excellent, haven't used the video function yet, but as I said the photos are perfect. Motion sensor works great, I often get pictures of birds, racoons, squirrels, and other wildlife as well as deer, my main target. Photo quality is awesome, both daylight and infrared pictures are clear and crisp.  Battery life is supposed to be 1 year but I have found that they usually last about 8000 pictures when running high sensitivity.  Obvisiously this is down a little when working in cold weather, but I usually manage to get close to 7000 pictures out of a set. Case is waterproof and lasted through 3 days of constant rain followed by about four days of being completely covered by snow. My only complaint is the construction of the case,it appears to be made of a cheap plastic that does not hold up very well in cold weather, one of the mounting brackets broke my first use in snow so now it takes some rigging to get the camera to stand straight up. Also the brackets could be placed in much better places ( possible on the sides instead of directly in the center of the back???). As far as the menus, they are easy to follow and quick to navigate. Screen is easy to read meaning it can be programmed in the field without much trouble. Quick to setup, easy to use, great pictures, but still needs some work on the case to make it the perfect 5 star trail cam.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Does what it says it does", "Author": "Lisa Patterson", "ReviewID": "R22OYFKCQJD95K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this.

Fast trigger speed, long battery life. I've been comparing side by side the Bushnell to my Primos Blackout (they are mounted on the same tree). The Bushnell captures more deer than the Primos, possibly from the faster trigger speed. The downside of the camera is the day pictures are darker than that of the Primos and the night shots are blurred if the animal is moving. However, if the deer, racoon or possum is standing still during the camera shot, the image is clear enough to make out what it is. I like how small the camera is and it's really easy to program.

Based on the fact it took 6 great photos of a buck (that was with a 10 second reset delay) on the first night the camera was installed is proof that the cam does not spook deer.Nothing negative to write about this camera after the first few days of use.

It's a big box that stands out like a sore thumb; other cams have \"advanced\" flat-backed oval shapes to blend in on a tree.-\"Trigger speed 1 second\": seems more like 3; I pushed a wheelbarrow full of firewood past it numerous times and it barely catches me in the frame.Other complaints:-Date/time stamp on video is only on the first frame or two; no way to read it without pausing playback on every clip. Very annoying.-The batteries come loose easily and often need reseating after mounting the camera. I think that's why it didn't do field scans as programmed but still caught me going and coming back after 6 days.-10 second delay between turn-on and active mode is an annoyance because I spend a minute or two positioning and concealing it.-The IR-LED bank glows red on activation; an attention grabbing feature that may prompt people to steal, bears to maul and coyotes to avoid these cameras; 'black-out' type models are advertised without this problem and would be preferable.-A simple security feature in the firmware could register this camera to it's rightful owner and disable it for thieves; negligent to omit it imo. Not even a molded-in s/n; just a sticker. Make a little effort here Bushnell. (I subtly scratched my name on mine.)-Video and multi-pic settings are nice for sensor-activated shots but for periodic field scan shots are just wasteful and it's a major deficiency that there's only an all-or-nothing selection.Picture, video and audio quality are all pretty good except for twilight conditions where pics are often washed out, which also happens occassionally during daylight shots for some reason.I take along an assortment of color and camo tape to help conceal the camera in a particular environment and I'll consider material from worn out camo clothes when hunting season nears and the woods get crowded but this thing is big and boxy and difficult to conceal very well.Twice now it ended up taking a pic a minute 24/7 though field scan was set to 15 minutes; thousands of pics to go through.Overall: I'm finding trail-camming an interesting hobby even with this pita camera, but if I get another it will have to be much better designed than this one.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Mine Died 1st Year", "Author": "John Guess", "ReviewID": "R1Z95WTQPTSTDI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Worked great for about 3 months.

No Problems.  Set up  instructions were clear and the process was somewhat intuitive.  After adjusting the camera just the way I wanted it I attached it to a a small tripod using the threaded socket in the base of the unit and set it outside on a stone retaining wall near my home. I pointed the camera towards a dark space between my house and an adjoining building.  A few hours after dark I walked in front of the camera to check it out and noted that the IR lights emitted a soft red glow as I came within range of the motion detector.  The next morning I retrieved the camera and easily removed the SD card, popped it into a slot on my computer and read the contents.  There were about 6 still images on the card.  A couple from when I was setting the camera and a couple from when I was retrieving the camera.  There was also a clear photo of me, time stamped at 20:33 the night before, taken when I walked in front of it just to check it out.  There was also a very clear photo of a large raccoon taken at 20:46.  I was pleased with the results.The problem arose when I tried to change a few of the set up options.  The three way switch that controls off/setup/on was defective.  With a lot of tender manipulation I could get the camera to go back and forth between off and on but it would not go into the middle position, which is the setup mode.Really irked me.  I liked everything else about the camera but the switch is a real weak point in the design and construction of the unit. It is flimsy and does not click into any position.  Its operation is very mushy.I sent the camera back for a replacement (Amazon was no problem to deal with), with the hopes that the replacement unit will be more reliable.  If it is not, I will have to return it for a refund.UPDATE SEPTEMBER 29, 2012Exchange was straightforward, no problems or complaints.The new (replacement) camera has a three way switch that is modestly improved compared to the broken one which I returned, but after several days of use it seems to be fully serviceable.I have the camera set on NORMAL sensitivity (options are high, normal, or low).  I have it set on 8 megapixel still images and 3 images per triggering event (taken at one second intervals).  Its night time performance has been very good.  There has not been a single false trigger since I set it out.  The nights here have been very cool (40 to 50 degrees and very still).  I know this sort of weather provides optimum environmental conditions for the camera's night time use. I will be interested to see how it performs in the heat of summer.So far the camera has captured rabbits and racoons (as well as me setting up and checking on the camera).  Range is excellent.  Image quality at night is very good out to about 40 feet.  Dark images are discernible from 40 feet out to about 50 feet.  Pitch black beyond 50 feet.

Even the good pics are not very clear, I tried all the different settings from 3mp to 8mp and no change. I had a Moultrie 4mp i40 and it was the best camera i ever had even after a bear ripped it up, rained in it and filled it with water and it still worked for about one more year and finally crashed. After reading all the great reviews on the bushnell i thought i would give it a try and i am going to try to find another i40. The good things about the bushnell is that everytime it takes a pic there is always something there and it is very easy on batteries.

All arrived in excellent condition and assembly and set up appeared easy enough. I planned to attach the security case to a tree with lag screws drop in the camera and start scouting counting horns. So here is the problem - I could not get the camera to slide into the case with the lag screws installed. Turns out that there is a small plastic piece protruding from the back of the camera designed to hold the camera away from the tree if you are not using the security case. Unfortunately, the design seems poor so the camera won't fit into the security case which was supposedly designed for this product, if you attach it to an object with lag screws. Options would be to attach the case to the tree with the strap provided for the camera, consider flat head screws, or cut off the plastic support piece from the camera back. I chose the latter and soon found that the plastic tab is hollow thus creating a 5X4 mm hole in the camera back. Fortunately, I was able to seal the hole with some plastic filler from the auto parts store and the camera then fit well into the security case. I then passed the lock cable 8471D through the security case and once again the camera would not fit! No big deal as the case comes with a lock so I just eliminated the cable. I certainly would not waste money buying the lock cable again.After I finally was able to install the camera and case, I was satisfied with its performance. B&W; photos are surprisingly clear - easily able to see animals and count points which is all I really need. The daytime color photos are somewhat blurry but this may be partially due to wind moving leaves etc. as no wildlife was in the frame. Burned through the first set of eight AAs in about 3 weeks so expect to buy plenty of batteries if you plan to leave it in the field all fall.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "When it worked it was only barely", "Author": "John L.
