{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best monitor system on the market. Period.", "Author": "Donielle L.", "ReviewID": "R28D56A28NPUU8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With our first child, I purchased a standard audio-only monitor that was on sale. Despite its short falls and antiquated technology, it did the trick. Things went downhill fast, though - the rechargeable battery on the mobile unit began dying within a few months, making it useless unless it was on the docking station 24/7.Now expecting our second child, I did extensive research into a new monitor system. I knew we would need two cameras (one for each kiddos room), and I wanted them to be able to connect to wifi so we could check-in on them when travelling (preferably through an app with our mobile devices). The typical monitor-systems had too many issues reported by customers and/or Consumer Reports - long lag time, short range, poor customer service, and the ability for tech savy individuals to hack into the digital/analog frequencies.WifiBaby had the best reviews of any consumer site I viewed and had all of the features I was looking for - mobile connectivity, secure stream, remote access, infrared, can view multiple video streams at once, etc. My only hesitation was the price, since I needed two, and having to pay separately for the mobile app (again, twice, since my husband and I do not share the same iTunes account). I'm glad I got over that! WifiBaby is hands-down the best monitor system. My favorite feature is the ability to set the audio sensitivity and squelch-limit so I don't have to listen to the white noise machine in kiddos room! When the noise level surpasses the set threshold, it unmutes so I only hear the pertinent noise!First recommendation - purchase directly from WifiBaby.net because you will get a small discount on each camera unit when purchasing more than one with the same transaction.  Also, shipping is free and 2-day delivery is standard.Second recommendation - take advantage of the WifiBaby Pro support, especially when setting up the remote access. The customer service is AMAZING. I had same-day service and my rep spent over an hour with me getting things working. If you can't set up the remote connection following their directions right away, don't waste any more time (unless you are an IT guru and/or know how to make a gateway through your network firewall).I have recommended this to all of my friends who are expecting or already have children. Best. Thing. Ever.", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great setup!", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R1ZRKUKEU9Q7R1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I see a lot of reviews (on the WiFi Baby 2) refer to setup and configuration.  I thought it was a breeze.  Mind you, I'm more of a techie, but when buying a device that will become a part of your home wireless network, you need to at least know how your network works.  However, if you do not, WiFi Baby provides fantastic guides and has outstanding customer support to get you up and running.I actually turned the wireless off and am using the camera over ethernet and powerline (through the electrical outlets).  If you give your camera a static IP on the network, it makes things easier.  All of this is very easy through the web interface of the camera.  The 2013 model even comes with a built in link that you can use away from home so you do not have to search around for a dynamic DNS service on your own.Although some other non-WiFi wireless baby monitors come with monitors as well, their batteries last for one, maybe two hours at best if using the video.  It is extremely nice to use the family iPad which has a much better battery life.  Streaming any kind of video (YouTube, etc.) will wear down the battery more quickly, but the iPad's battery is as good as you're going to get for a video baby monitor.Pros:Wireless or wiredPreconfigured link for away from home viewingViewable from iOS, Android, or any computer via web interfaceEasy setupFantastic supportAmerican companyiPad as monitor (sound can run in background too!)Multiple camera support - huge for meHave not needed to restart camera yetCons:Pan and tilt would be nice (but not necessary when you think about it and see the large viewing angle)Our cam is near a wall near white curtains and you get a white ring in the night vision due to the reflection from the curtains.  If you point the camera towards the center of the room (away from the curtains), this goes away.  Probably specific to my application but tweaking the placement reduced the effect significantly.We will be buying more of these in the future.", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome product", "Author": "A.

I had no trouble getting the camera configured to view on my home wifi connection, but I did have a little trouble setting up the remote viewing so I could still see the video feed when I was away from home.  I went to the Wifi Baby website and set up an appointment time for someone in service to contact me.  The service representative was very punctual, very nice, and very fast!  He told me exactly what I had done wrong and even helped me do it via screen sharing so all I had to do was watch!  It was a totally painless process.  I love that I can even use it as a security-type camera once my children are grown.  Picture and sound totally comparable to the Summer baby monitor I was using before it died on me.

So we use all the available technologies. Read below.My wife and I are having our first baby and looking at the reviews of all the cameras out there it seemed like everyone had some type of flaw to it. One big thing is that our friends were always losing the baby monitor or the batteries were dead. Since we always have our phone or ipad we thought this was perfect. We also both work so remote viewing is a MAJOR plus.The item arrived quickly and was installed right away. It worked right off the bat but we had issues port forwarding. My wifi network is somewhat complex with repeaters. As a amateur techie I wanted to resolve the matter myself but just could not get around to it. I submitted a remedy ticket.Within 2 minutes I received an email asking what time would work best for tech support to call. I actually stated anytime today would be perfect. Within less than a minute Gary called. We setup a remote viewing session. I explained to him my very complex situation. He was very kind and could speak English on things than many might not understand. He helped get my remote viewing to work within minutes.He then said, how do you view it, lets set up all your apps. Within a few minutes we got all of them set up.

I even had two other people try to help me set it up and they couldn't either.

Love the app for the ipad and iphone. The visual and audio quality are fantastic and there are a lot of options to play with. The fact that this can serve as a baby monitor, nanny cam and security cam should help to make this the gift that will keep on giving!Had some initial hiccups with the setup so had to call support. Was so glad I did and highly recommend going this route if not technically savvy. Very pleasant experience and informative. Everything was explained succinctly and the rest of the setup was pretty much a breeze with a little help.Love this product so far and the team that stands behind it!", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lots of issues", "Author": "Luke", "ReviewID": "R250TTAIHO7KR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I consider myself to be pretty tech savvy, this camera setup pretty easy at first. I followed all instructions exactly and got the camera connected very easily, then the problems started.My router is a Comcast Xfinity SMC router/modem combo I usually get between 20-50mbps download speeds on my network and never have issues with any other devices. The camera appeared to lag (around 4 seconds on audio/video). Then the video started to work real-time, yet the audio was 1-2 seconds behind (not a huge deal).When you initially set up the camera it must be via Ethernet cable directly hooked up to your router. After I rebooted the camera like instructed and hooked it up via Wi-Fi, that's when the serious issues took place. I moved the camera into the baby room (15 ft. from the router) and the video would either freeze or completely drop. The app used for android devices is the \"TinyCam Monitor Pro\" ($3.99 at the play store). The camera would connect, then fail, then connect and finally I was unable to connect at all. This is a HUGE problem and a MAJOR bug in the camera! If the camera freezes, you don't get notified at all. Your video and audio just no longer work. If you are relying on this for peace of mind, this is a deal breaker for me.Then there is the issue of the \"night vision\" mode. My camera was set to auto for all modes, yet the night vision mode would come on randomly even when there was adequate light in the room. Also, as other people have stated, the audible sound the camera makes when switching to night vision is loud and could disturb your baby.Next issue was the nanny cam set up. This is the reason I actually chose this camera over others. I followed all instructions, my router even states it supports UnPn, yet it wouldn't communicate with the camera. I tried the port forwarding thing and everything appeared to check out okay until I actually tried to view the external URL that you use to view it in Nanny Cam mode. This process would not be possible IMO for a person that isn't tech savvy.Bottom line: I will give support a chance to try and fix my issues; if I am not satisfied with functionality and reliability after that I will be returning this camera. I will post an update after I speak to the support team (going on 24 hrs. now of waiting).UPDATE: 4/16/14:  Called customer support, set up a screen share/phone call to fix my issues.  The tech was very helpful and fixed the nanny cam feature rather easy.  I then moved the camera to the baby's room (15 ft away from the router) and it wouldn't work, or when it did it was terribly unreliable.  We checked the settings and the camera was getting 4/5 bars for WiFi.  The tech couldn't troubleshoot the issue, so I had to request an RMA.  I had to put ANOTHER $200 deposit down so they will mail the replacement unit out before they receive my defective unit. So as of today I am out $459 and still don't have a working camera.  I will update again when I receive the replacement.UPDATE: 4/22/14:  Received my 2nd WiFi Baby camera today, set up an appointment with customer support and they were helpful. I had the exact same issues with this camera.  It freezes ALOT, this is a HUGE issue if I am using it for the safety of my daughter.  I would not trust this device to be reliable at all.The tech said it was probably my router that was the issue, not the camera.  I would say that his assessment was plausible if my other 10 wireless devices didn't work flawlessly or the speedtest.net didn't show 10 MBPS + download at the furthest distance from the router.  I am returning this item and will be getting a camera/monitor that is stand alone with the ability to be used over WiFi.I would NOT recommend this \"made in China\" junk to anyone, FYI if you search the internet there are SEVERAL other cameras that are the exact same with a different name on them.

A quick phone call to the company, and Jeff was on it in no time. After sharing my screen (with unbinding patience!) he adroitly navigated through the systems we have in place, got us up and running on MULTIPLE devices (3 iPhones, 3 iPads, etc). The \"away\" function will only work with the add-on purchase of the app, but, for me, it's a well worth while, nominal purchase to be able to use this function. Baby Wifi 3G is the only monitor I found where this is even an option. There are some reviews complaining about having to pay for the app, but it should be noted that they are 2 different companies. It's all of $10. If you're paying the higher price for this adaptable monitor, it's just another $10, though NOT required if you're just using at home.On my first work trip post-maternity leave, and post-Jeff's set-up, I couldn't get the \"away\" feature to work.

So you have to keep it super still and upright the whole night which isn't easy when you are groggy and just want a closer look.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic product with amazing customer service.", "Author": "Haley", "ReviewID": "R2JX154Q3DL2J7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are not tech savy- no worries!

Truly, he went above and beyond to help. He not only got me up and running, he fixed a few issues I had and helped with the away feature. Just for anyone who doesn't understand, you do need to connect the camera for initial setup and once it's done, all you need is an outlet! We monitor through our IPhones and iPads. The app was an additional cost of $11.99, to us, a small price compared to batteries or replacement batteries and will be great went warm weather hits and we are outside where our old monitor never reached!

As far as the app goes, you are able to click out of the app and put your phone to sleep while keeping the sound of the monitor on; however, the volume drops significantly and you can barely hear it. Second, a monitor at this price should really have temperature included. Instead, you have to purchase an extra third-party thermometer to link to the app. Third, the app that you need to use this monitor costs $13- That is ridiculous! Despite all of these things (most we learned when we first installed it), we decided to still give it a try. It disconnects more often than it stays connected through the night. Our wifi service and signal have no issues. We have used other wifi monitors and have not had as many disconnect issues as we had with this monitor. We had to send it back.

When it actually works...", "Author": "CMD", "ReviewID": "R1TYUVE906AIXD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The problem here is not really the camera, it's the app and connection. When it is connected, the monitor is great. Great quality video, wide angle, good with noise detection, etc. The app crashes or doesn't connect all of the time. We actually bought another monitor (motorola video) to have as backup and for when we travel. Since I started working 2 weeks ago, I would say 75% of the time I try to view my baby's room using the app I am unable to connect. That is not a good %. We got a 2nd one to use as a 'nanny cam' in the living room (but really so I can watch my baby from work when he's playing) but will likely return it because it's not reliable (that said, we don't really want to start a whole new system here so we may just deal with faulty connectivity.) Customer service is great, but unfortunately it would be extremely time consuming to call every time the app fails to connect. It actually kind of amazes me that with today's tech advances, there is no really good wifi baby monitor/nanny cam option. Seems like such a basic thing. My 2 dings on the camera itself are: it does not pan or tilt, so while it's a 'wide screen' you can't move the view remotely like you can on the Motorola digital video monitor, and second, the infrared lights around the camera are pretty bright and often our baby stares at it (keeping him awake - but I should add, once we hung the camera on the wall, further away from the crib, this seemed to stop happening... so make sure to position the camera a few feet away from the crib.) In summary, I don't know if you should buy this. We obviously kept it instead of returning it, but the connectivity seems to be getting worse the longer we have it (which is only about a month now.) I guess we decided some out of area connectivity is better than none, and based on what I've heard this is still better than most of the wifi options out there. Oh last thing - it definitely works better when we are at home connecting. Most of the non-connectivity happens when we are trying to access remotely.", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "An expensive mistake", "Author": "MAQ \"IRRegular User\"", "ReviewID": "R1GY9JK3QU3IKI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Had this product for over a week now but I am still unable to set it up. One would guess that for the price you pay, the company would actually invest some money on the software to make setting it up and configuring it easy.

Instead, the company is still in the dark ages with this software and it takes many steps to configure and still you get many problems along the way.

You can see noises and can dissect if they are just baby grunts, or real cries.Things I don't like:-This seems intuitative, but you can only view it on your phone, ipad, or computer. Now, that's nice, except for when you want to use your phone. And if your household doesn't have with an iPad, or a land line, you're screwed. Also, if you have a nanny and you leave, does she have to spend the $12 to get the app? It's not really the most...convenient monitor on the market.-There is a loud clicking noise when the camera transfers between night vision and day vision. You'd think it wouldn't disrupt the babies, but it does.Honestly, the fact that you have to spend $12 on an app for this, and you are tethered to your phone--makes me hate it and wish I had never purchased it.
