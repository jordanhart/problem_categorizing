I didn't mind the installation of these cameras which included drilling holes in walls, putting wire molding over the wires and getting all the extra accessories you need to make the system function, i.e. 50ft ethernet cable, 1TB hard drive, etc. When I finally turned the system on it went into a rebooting cycle. It continued this cycle indefinitely every three minutes until I finally shut it off. I contacted tech support and eventually got a new DVR since the old one was tested and confirmed defective. The new one did the same thing. I tried switching the hard drive, swapping the ethernet cable, playing around with the settings but nothing worked. Altogether I dedicated 40 hours to getting it to work and it was all a waste of time and money. Don't buy this garbage. The vga camera quality was horrible too and you have to work in IT to be able to setup the network capabilities.. but then again, what do you expect to get for a $100 surveillance system?", "Date": "August 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Average guy review", "Author": "Mal", "ReviewID": "RKJG56IHJ2RSZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Okay. So I am in the military and a tech-geek. But what I'm definitely not is a rent-a-cop, D-Day prepper type of guy. Just a husband looking to add an additional layer of security.My experience with this product has actually been pretty good. I live in a wooded area and needed something to:A.Record at night, and at day...pretty well.B.Be cost effective.C. In the unfortunate event that I have to discharge my firearm here in Maryland, I can prove that I was exercising my second constitutional right...the camera's definitely are capable of spotting and identifying potential douchebags on playback.In my heavily wooded area, the night vision came through pretty good at night, to the point where I could easily identify somebody in the PITCH DARK.Daytime picture was equally as good too, just a cut above night vision though.The DVR interface is pretty basic, imagine Redbox's rental interface--but just not so red. If you're savvy with poking around in your computer BIO's than you will find the camera DVR interface VERY easy to use and configure.BE WARNED-You will need to purchase and install a SATA hard drive in order to save any recordings (this requires opening the DVR up, 4 phillips screws) Check out NewEgg or Amazon to find a hard drive, I recommend a minimum of AT LEAST 500GBIn my honest opinion, this is a descent camera setup for home or business security uses. The picture clarity reminded me of my experience walking into my local 7-Eleven and the system that greets me every time I walk in the door--except that these Zmodo's look much cooler, with no chime ;]I grabbed my set on NewEgg back in NOv of 2012 for $99 on Black Friday. Amazon seems to be the only retailer still offering it.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$328.50", "Features": "View Footage Online or on a Smartphone\nAdvanced Motion Detection Recording\nInstant Email Alerts if Activity Detected\nView from a TV or PC monitor\n4 Indoor/Outdoor Weatherproof Color Day Night Cameras", "Name": "Zmodo PKD-DK40107 4Channel DVR 480TVL 6mm Weatherproof Camera Surveillance Kit **NO HDD**", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510PYWSI0iL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007WLR5ZS"}}
