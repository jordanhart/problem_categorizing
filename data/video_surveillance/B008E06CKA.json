{"Reviews": [{"Title": "No monthly fees", "Author": "Michael Abreu", "ReviewID": "RL9Y0BKOYWG1Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this security system for my 2 bedroom condo. The installation was very easy and simple to set up, mainly because all the sensors that were included in the kit were already paired \"Thanks SecurityMan\". However, I did need some assistance programming my telephone number which allows the host to call my cell phone whenever the alarm is triggered, but with the help of their tech support center I was able get them programmed with ease [User error, I forgot to add the 1 in front of the area code \"DUH\"]. I also like the fact that I can upgrade my security system at any time by adding more door sensors, motion sensors, sirens and even a motion sensor with a hidden camera, which I've already ordered.Overall I am very happy with this system and would recommend it anyone that wants an affordable and expandable home security system without having to pay monthly service fees.", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$99.99", "Features": "Easy-to-use and cost-effective D.I.Y.
