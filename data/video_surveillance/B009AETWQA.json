{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Decent enough, but not reliable", "Author": "Skoog", "ReviewID": "R1C2UYDD9GRRCN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought one of these to replace a non-\"My DLink\" NVR, in the hope that I could finally view my IP cameras over the internet.It did work, I can seen live and recorded video on the \"my DLink\" site from all the cameras hooked up to it, whether the cameras are \"My DLink\" or not.  By the way, the previous NVR (a DNS-726-4) was also unreliable AND I could never figure out how to view its content over the internet.Major detractor:  The product is not reliable.  It must be rebooted three times a week, and it does not have a maintenance function to auto-restart.  Sometimes when I reboot it via the web interface, it does not come back up on the network and I have to crawl under the desk to unplug it for a hard restart.  If I forget to reboot it, sure enough it will be out of commission -- responding to pings, but not allowing log in, nor is it recording.  For a home security product, this is unacceptable.I've expended a lot of money and energy on these D-Link security cam products, and in the final analysis I feel cheated.  Tech support from DLink is essentially non-existent.  Being a pretty forgiving consumer, I would rate this NVR a \"B\" if it would just reliably record 24/7 without a hitch.  Various literature on the D-Link site describes features like finding when an item goes missing, etc, no such features are present on this device.The associated MyDLink web feature is OK, but not very appealing.  You can examine one camera at a time, in a completely different interface than the native NVR's web server.  In comparison, the MyQ-See version of this service (another vendor) is just like connecting to the DVR directly, over the internet, with all features enabled just as if you were inside your router.Conclusion:  A marginally acceptable product that could use a lot of improvements.", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Like but not perfect", "Author": "Ed", "ReviewID": "R1HLV45AHLFFOK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good little NVR for the price as long as you are familiar with dvr's & security cams; you should be pretty happy with it.  Does NOT include Hard Drives.  The unit does freeze up every once & a while but if you put a timer on it, it works great (this should be a feature in the software sadly not, it needs to be reset just like DVR's.  Has motion detection with dlink cams, one feature I really like is mydlink.com backup so any computer with a browser/internet and I can hit the video & recordings. Records sound.  Bandwidth required is not too bad considering the quality of image.", "Date": "April 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Product", "Author": "Marlin Graham", "ReviewID": "RQQ2D8FZ81T4M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This NVR arrived in excellent condition, was easy to use and did everything the manufacturer promised.
