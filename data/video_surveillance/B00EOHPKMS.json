It's easy to setup and when it works it's a fantastic. The problem arises when viewing the camera's remotely. About once a week, I was completely unable to connect to the device remotely either from a PC or using my iPhone app. The problem solves itself when I manually switch the power on and off from the physical DVR. So if you happen to be viewing from afar and have a connection problem then you're out of luck.Secondly, LOREX's phone customer service took about 1.5 hours to connect. Also, if you're trying to reset your password, it may take as little as 1 minute to as long as 2 hours to receive your temporary password. On some occasions, the password doesn't work if you send multiple requests.UPDATE: 2/13/2014To be fair, in the last 3 months I have not experienced a single connection problem with the DVR. It seems that the latest software update has fixed the connection errors I was previously experiencing. I haven't done anything except leave the device on auto update so it take's care of itself. Now that the system works, I'm left with no more complaints. Night vision captures really well even in the presence of pitch dark. Seems as if it does so by emitting an invisible infrared red light from the camera itself and then going into ultra light sensitive mode.Also, I would recommend creating an account on the lorex website, registering the device, and registering a DDNS.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EOHPKMS"}}
