I decided to go for a more economical choice by adding a couple of these Hikvision cameras to the network.  I had heard some good things about these cameras and considering these are about one third of the cost of the Samsung cameras that I purchased, I decided to give them a chance.Like a previous reviewer has said, these also can be purchased even 100 dollars cheaper direct from overseas, however in addition to what he points out about the risk of getting ripped off, there is another big reason not to do that.  Hikvision USA will not warranty those cameras that are the asian version.  The Hikvision USA cameras come with a 3 year warranty and for me I would rather be safe than sorry by paying the approximate 100 dollars more.  Mine came from Nelly's Security and so far they have been awesome with their customer service and support by answering all my email questions.Having just now connected them, the hard part was for me, running the cabling that I needed from the attic to the areas I needed the cameras.  One minor complaint is that I wish the screw plate had a bit more area to hide the cabling for those like me who aren't running the cabling through a wall and instead have to run it outside.  I had to add a wood block with a groove in it to help protect the connection from the elements due to that lack of space.One big complaint is that the zoom and focus are manual on the camera and you have to climb the ladder, remove the sun shield and unscrew the cap to make the adjustments and depending on the location of the cameras, sometimes that isnt particularly easy.  Then you have to make sure you line up the cap so that it watertight as well.  While balancing on a ladder 20 plus feet up is difficult and Hikvision could have made this easier to access for adjustments.So far the picture looks great and the other adjustments seem pretty easy and the cameras are working fine so far.  I will update once they have worked for a while longer.One thing I almost forgot is that even though the description here says that it will take a regular SD memory card, it does not.  It only takes the mini SD card up to 64 Gigs.Decent cameras for the price but a couple of my issues makes this 4 instead of 5 stars.", "Date": "March 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Pretty Awesome Camera", "Author": "Blah", "ReviewID": "R2F1T2WSWVRV5A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wish the damn thing didn't cost so much, you can order the same camera straight from China for about $100 less but it can take anywhere from 30-60 days to ship to you and you have a high chance of being ripped off. That's why I ordered mine from Amazon warehouse deals with Prime, two day shipping and I knew I wouldn't get ripped off. I have been using this camera in production for about a week now, it wasn't too hard to focus but having manual focus does suck, why isn't it autofocus?! Not uncommon for cheaper IP cams though, having to manually focus is my only gripe, picture looks great, works with all common apps and software. If you don't care about being able to change focal length the 4mm version is cheaper, I like being able to adjust it though. I should be using these for all of my outdoor applications unless something better comes along.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GFFPFEU"}}
