{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Cam, Fabulous Support", "Author": "ANWaudio", "ReviewID": "R30YJP975SZ2JH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A friend recommended the the Sharx line of cams; I was impressed with the picture quality and very pleased with the comprehensive web-enabled features. All I'd need to monitor vacant property remotely over the 'net would be the cam, router, and modem -- no local host computer was required. What really amazed me has been the speed and quality of Sharx support. I needed more than the average user -- not because of the cam, but because of my admittedly ancient router. When a lot of companies would have said, \"sorry, we aren't going to waste our time, YOU, customer, have to buy new equipment,\" Sharx stepped up and helped me get all the functionality: streaming, motion sensing triggers, email alerts, clip record and immediate export to another remote system. Doubly amazing is that I often got a support email reply back from them in 15 minutes or less. More than once they offered to call with voice support on their dime, but I felt guilty about using so much of their time so I kept it to email. Good cam, great folks.", "Date": "October 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "VIPcella-IR SCNC2700WP PoE", "Author": "anthonyg", "ReviewID": "R3HPQRFNE4W9B9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good choice for a camera of this type in this price range.  I'm a novice user of security cameras, but I've tried out a couple models from other providers, like Uniden, and I really like the features and ease of use on this one compared to those.The PoE feature is very nice to use for a couple of reasons.  For one thing, wireless is nice but wired is preferable if you want a constant, reliable connection to your device.  This is especially helpful if you're recording or uploading from the device itself, or looking to get a reliable connection to your camera from another location off the internet.The picture is good when running over a fast network.  There are three setting in the camera - two for IP networks and one that can be used for viewing over the internet on a cell's data network.  You can setup each of these streaming modes and then pick and choose which ones to use for any of the alarm or recording options.Lots of options to use to capture motion detection, constant recording, snapshots, length of recordings, email and FTP uploads, etc.Updates:  my device, which I bought new, is running 4.45 (build 20120806)firmware which, as far as I can tell, is the latest.  But I just don't know if there will be updates or where to get them.  The Sharx website is pretty bare, and though I've heard their support is good, you have to email them to get them to get back to you. No support forums or chat or even phone support, unless they give you a number to call them.  A little disconcerting, but I'm willing to go with it for the time being.  I still have time to return this to Amazon if the tech support is lacking.I'm waiting to see what kind of response I can get from support and just how stable this little thing is going to be over time.  It's impressive so far...=======", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sharx Security VIPcella-IR SCNC2700WP", "Author": "J. Springer \"none\"", "ReviewID": "R2TZKUX2DLI8ZY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We installed the SCNC2700WP this weekend at a remote location.  We have a motion sensor installed and will get a message saying that it is sensing occupancy.  With this camera we can see what is going on versus driving several hours to investigate.  We considered several other models made by Panasonic, Imogen and Belkin; and after reading reviews on Amazon decided to buy this camera - the night vision and the excellent product support really sold us.  The picture quality is amazing for both day and night.  The daytime picture is color and the night is black and white using infrared.  We are able to see what is going on inside and on the deck 24 hours a day.  We also tested the camera during the daytime by placing it in a window looking outside and were able to see clearly as if we were standing at the window.  The picture is so clear you can identify the types of birds at the bird feeder.  If somebody is walking in the camera viewing area, they are blurry until they stop moving.  We initially installed the camera looking over a white counter-top but the bright white surface washes out the picture, especially at night.The instruction manual is comprehensive but hard to follow.  It mixes windows, android and apple instructions together and it is not always clear which one is which.  It would have been much easier to use if each operating system was separate.  If you are a savvy computer geek those instruction are probably clear, but we are not.  This unit is not wireless and requires both a Cat 5 cable and a power cable to operate.  To use POE (power over Ethernet) you need a special router or an attachment for the router to use; the POE allows you to eliminate the power cable.  In hindsight, the wireless one would have been easier to install.  It installed easily for viewing over the local IP network but we had trouble viewing using the external IP address.  We contacted the company via e-mail and got excellent support and are now able to view externally.  Their pledge is \"We pledge that we will not let you fail.  Contact us with any questions, no matter how simple or how complicated.\" So far their pledge is true to form.  We will be setting up some other web applications later this week and will update this product review.Update May 2013:  We love this camera; it is still providing clear pictures day and night.  We have not had any problems with it.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product and customer service", "Author": "Marco", "ReviewID": "RFLMEI9AP6O0D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the second camera that I purchase from Sharx. The software interface is very user friendly and, although I hit a few snags, customer service was excellent in their quick response and good working knowledge of the camera. CameraFTP was also very helpful with configuring the camera to upload the pictures to their secure website (and they have a very simple iPhone app for reviewing the captured images).", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love that POE!!!", "Author": "Faja4x", "ReviewID": "RHPTVGHDTFR2Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sharx make great cameras if you are interested in getting a great picture.  I have installed probably over 35 of their cameras for smaller firms looking for an inexpensive solution for their security.  I have also installed Foscams, Lofteks, Panasonics...you name it and my personal preference are the Sharx units.  I just installed this POE unit in my home so that I can monitor when I am away.  And speaking of that, I have to give a shout out to a great little iPhone app named IP Cam Viewer...it makes monitoring you cameras as easy as pie and also provides sound.  While many of the cameras I have installed depend on wireless, I really prefer Ethernet when possible and the Power Over Ethernet feature of this camera makes this installation that much easier.  I have also found that powerline Ethernet adapters work wonderfully to extend the reach of a home or office network.  The Sharx cameras come with free software to enable viewing up to 4 cameras at once...a really nice interface that allows you to view all cameras or switch easily between them.  You will find that Sharx cameras cost more than the opening price point Foscams and Lofteks, but in my view, they are worth it.", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008B9UVBA"}}
