{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A very good camera.", "Author": "WARREN REEVES", "ReviewID": "R2Z94UURYNLFKY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Originally I purchased a  GXV3611_HD and it was just OK, but horrible in low light conditions. Then I bought this camera and realized that I should have only bought this camera for my needs. I am impressed with this camera. The picture is very sharp and clear, much improved over the 3611, and it has night vision, so no more need for extra lighting in order to view my camera at night. It has the same view angle as the 3611 does, so it replaced it perfectly for where I need it. The 3611 isn't a bad camera, but this one out classes it in every conceivable way. If you need a wide angle lens camera with a great picture, and you plan to mount it where the lighting gets dim from time to time but you want to be able to view it clearly under any lighting condition, then buy this camera.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$164.95", "Features": "High quality 1.2 Megapixel CMOS sensors and HD lens\nAdvanced multi-streaming rate real-time H.264, Motion JPEG at 720p and 1080p resolutions in full frame rate\nSupport Motion Detection and Notification on PC client\nBuilt-in high performance streaming server to allow at least 4 simultaneous viewers\nIntegrated Power-over-Ethernet (802.3af)", "Name": "GrandStream GXV3610-HD Infrared Fixed Dome HD IP Video Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ehUvNJpmL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00HAME994"}}
