Politte", "ReviewID": "R3IDIZ2Z6QO17Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price, this is a fantastic system that was fairly easy to get up and going after the initial install.  I love being able to keep an eye on things around the house while we're out and about.  Being able to check up on things and receive motion activated e-mail alerts brings peace of mind. You won't find any other security systems this good for the price.  Something to know that's not really mentioned is that only one channel can record in D1 - the rest will be in CIF, but it's really no big deal as the CIF resolution offers good clarity as well.  Easily the best bang for the buck!", "Date": "November 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "420TVL, Really?", "Author": "A. DO", "ReviewID": "R2N862NMAZ18RD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My initial draw to this was it's cheap price, and the fact that it was an all-in-one package, that means less headaches for an intermediate installer as myself. But the actual experience was far from expected.Pros: All-inclusive system, inexpensiveCons:1. 420TVL is a complete lie.  Even bypassing the DVR and hooking this straight to a monitor, you'd be lucky if you could make out people's faces at more than 10 feet away.2. Buggy software, making programming and remote viewing over internet very difficult.3. Extremely cheap cables.  A light duty staple as able to kink, and render the cable useless during installation.  Upon closer inspection revealed that each connection is barely the width of a strand of hair.4. 4 days after installation, 1 camera started exhibiting symptoms and darkening of picture, with no changes to the surrounding environment at all.  And this was all In-door.Conclusion: STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "ZMODO 8CH H.264 CCTV", "Author": "greg", "ReviewID": "R1M7ZH9R2IIE4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "it works ,  in the daylight it is ok , but at night I was expecting a bit better qualityand I am not sure that the cameras are made by sony , it seems they are sony - type .plenty of cables for a house install , pretty easy to view and search recordnot bad for the money", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not what I would purchase in the future.", "Author": "Mark O.

BUT... only lasted 15 months!", "Author": "Bucky's Mom", "ReviewID": "RS9B0L2DOHPOC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After lots of reading, I finally committed to the Zmodo DVR.  Then, after lots of cussing, bleeding, and dirt, I finally got all the cables pulled where I wanted them.  I plugged in the power supplies, all the BNC cables, and turned it on.  Wow, it popped up all 8 channels!  My wife was impressed, and my kids were having a blast dancing and looking at themselves in all of the cameras.I still have to set up the internet functions, so there's still some \"fun\" ahead.  The on-screen menus are reasonably understandable; I was able to set it up for motion detection recording, change the sensitivity, and review recordings all without delving into the manual.That said, pulling the wires was NOT for the faint of heart; my wife had NO IDEA what I had committed to for installing this!  I did, though...Some more thoughts; you MUST have a way to get the mouse OR the remote control to work near your TV.  I bought an IR extender for this job, but it doesn't work (although the remote works just fine).  If you have to choose which control method to set up, I would go with the remote, as it has buttons that address many functions directly.  As far as I can tell, the mouse can work everything too.  I experimented with a presentation remote (as a mouse substitute), and it worked OK.  Not as well as it works on my computer, though.++ First update ++Getting the internet to work outside my home network required paying a specialist to come out and mess with it (with my help) for three solid hours (this is after I got it to work inside the home network with paid phone service help from Dell).  You CAN NOT get the video to work on a Windows phone, no matter what Zmodo tells you!  However, it works great on iThings.++++ Update after owning it for 15 months ++++Well, today my son wanted to pull some videos to study the secret lift of cats.  No luck!  I don't have a VGA output, analog vido output, and the mouse isn't lighting up.  I've tried turning it off, unplugging the power supply, changing the power supply, and cursing.  I'm really irritated!  I'm going to open up the case and see if I find something obvious, like a fuse, but I'm not hopeful.++++ Final updateWell, there wasn't anything obviously wrong inside or repairable.  Its dead.  15 months is NOT longe enough life.FYI, the Swann TruBlue was much easier to get running and ITS MANUAL IS IN ENGLISH!!!!", "Date": "February 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Review", "Author": "Seeta", "ReviewID": "RTLLYFLZKAKD2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought ths system and hooked it up home.
