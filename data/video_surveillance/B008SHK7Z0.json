{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Failure", "Author": "E. A. Larson \"ealgumby\"", "ReviewID": "RO5GF291DLF0G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have a bunch (more than dozen) older Panasonic netcams of various models, and bought several of these 'on faith' (i.e. didn't do my homework, my own fault) that they would:* perform to consistent standards demonstrated by prior Panasonic netcam products* play nicely with prior Panasonic netcam products* be some sort of upgrade over prior Panasonic netcam productsUnfortunately, I discovered they fail to meet these goals.What's wrong with them?* no PoE* no buffering* no backward compatibilityIf you're a big fan of wireless, you won't care about PoE, but then you wouldn't be getting this model either. If you do use the wired models, PoE is tremendously convenient under many circumstances, and I do not understand why Panasonic dropped this capability after seeming to head that way with their recent history of new releases. That's a strike against consistency, and nearly a deal-breaker for me right there.Lack of buffering definitely does sink the ship though. I have found that if you use triggers to initiate recording with Panasonic netcams, you will miss several critical frames before recording activates. In the older, buffered models, there is an option for pre-buffering, and IMO it is essential; if you don't use pre-buffering, you invariably capture what happened after the trigger event. Without on-camera buffering, there is by definition no pre-buffering. This is a complete failure right there in my book.Buffering offers advantages even for 24/7 streaming to NVR/monitoring devices. Momentary hiccups in connectivity don't have to result in dropped frames, but without buffering that's what you get. Frankly, I think the capability to record imagery on the camera itself is a basic functionality I cannot live without, and it boggles my mind why they would release a new model without this legacy capability. Once again, failure to maintain product line consistency.Lastly, no backward compatibility with previous models. I do not expect them to maintain the same old UI forever, but I do not forgive lack of backward inter-operability, especially when I already have a double-digit count of older models. There's a certain design/management philosophy I've seen recently in the tech industry (after 30 yrs experience) suggesting people should just, for lack of a better word, be 'forced' to upgrade. I find it unconscionably arrogant to assume every customer will be able to drop n-times the cost of a new unit to replace all of their old ones though. Yes, it's easier for the developers to upgrade without having to provide support for their previous models, and some customers tolerate this, especially with trendy product lines. I for one won't stand for it; if your latest product won't operate in multi-camera mode with my previous models, then I'm done buying new products from you. The *primary* reason I have continued to buy Panasonic over the years has not been for performance, but the knowledge (until now) that my new cams would work with my old ones: that is no longer the case, so end of the line for me. Not happy about it, at all.So in short, this product is a HUGE disappointment!Oh, I know, how can that be, given all the technological advances? H.264? Nice. Zonal motion detection? Ditto. That just doesn't cover it though, given the failures in the areas I've described above.Returned.", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice features, bad software", "Author": "watah", "ReviewID": "R1CBX6C6KENNV4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this for $70 or so on a sale here, and was very excited to test it out. The worst part about this software is having to install a specialized active x control and needing that on any web browser you want to view the camera. So in other words, it might as well have no web interface and rather some very nice firmware. It doesn't. The firmware seems very dated and the camera is very slow to respond. I had a problem with a dropping network connection. The camera wouldn't resolve it's own dropped network connection, I would have to manually power cycle it every time. I got frustrated and returned the unit. The 1.3 Megapixels was not a noticeable change from a 640x480 across my gigabit network. The one redeeming option was control of the shutter speed which allowed some night viewing when it was actually working.I returned mine a week later, and Amazon even credited the rush shipping without me asking! Amazing service, nice features, bad (seemingly abandoned camera.)", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Panasonic BL-VP104 720p ip Camera", "Author": "tomg", "ReviewID": "R2PMO70921QRG5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been changing my camera system over from the older Panasonic IP cameras (like the BB-HCM511, BL-C210, etc VGA) to the new VP104 and VT164...they both have wireless versions.  They all seem to use the same firmware/software.  First, they can't be set up or viewed \"out of the box\" on anything but a Windows based computer w/IE. However, they are compatible with equipment (like NVRs) that are \"Onvif\" compatible.  This means that they run on VioStor and many of the inexpensive NVRs coming out of China (at least the ones I have used).The 104 does not have a mic, speaker,  any hardware alarm inputs, or the heat sensor alarm of the VT164.  However, it does have motion detection and comes with a mounting bracket that mounts to the back.  All these camera put out very good video if there is enough light...don't expect as good a picture as the older models in low light applications...very noisy in low light. They can output 4:3 or wide screen.  Lots of setup features and options...however, no timer to trigger ftp for those wanting to upload a still image every few minutes to a server.  I like the camera interface, but it is completely different from the older UI...if you like the old one, it will take some time to get used to this one.5 stars because of the $100 price here.", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008SHK7Z0"}}
