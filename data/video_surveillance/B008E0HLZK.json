The picture and video are so clear and crisp.  I had trouble getting it to go wireless, and needed tech support.  I had trouble at first with tech support reaching someone.  I went to their facebook page, posted needed help and I got it.After a slight delay, the technician was super helpful, called me,  called me back when we lost connection, went in set up for me, explained to me what he was doing and sent me instructions to check through android phone so I could add that too.  very knowledgeable man, who exceeded my expectations.  (worth the wait!)  We also have a Dlink camera and the tech I used through them for help was hard to navigate with and it was frustrating.  dealing with zmodo tech was a breeze.  If it hadn't been the delay in being about to reach customer service, tech support  I would have rated it 5 star!", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$159.99", "Features": "Easy QR Code Scan with iPhone or Android Smartphone\n720P HD Video - 1 Megapixel Camera\n2.8mm Fixed Lens\nSupports up to 64GB SD Card\nH.264 Compression No Portforwarding Needed for Remote Access", "Name": "Zmodo ZH-IXD15-WC 720p HD Megapixel Indoor Mini Wireless IP Camera (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41odJYB79ZL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008E0HLZK"}}
