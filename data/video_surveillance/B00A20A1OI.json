These cameras were so easy to set up we didn't even need to use the online instructions for how to set them up.  We used an old computer monitor (acer brand) and it works perfect for the monitor.  Thought we could use an external hard drive to record, but we were wrong so we ordered an actual hard drive.  Color during the day, black and white at night, capable of audio as well. The night vision is phenomenal too, looks super bright and we can keep an eye on the pups all day long with the iPod app!", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Travlin Ray", "ReviewID": "R14YPDHQE4T87Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There were mixed reviews on this set. It is entry level but does everything it says it does. I used the online videos to setup but once I watched those it was easy to follow the instructions from there. Excellent product, I have mine setup for remote login via a free i-pad app.You can also setup motion sensor ability and email notifications. The interface is very simple and there are many options which I still haven't worked out how to use just yet.House is much safer with these watching over it and soon we will update some of the cameras in key areas of the house.There was a lot of negativity about the cords that come with this set but we had no problems. Cheap or Expensive, as long as they work and withstand the elements, what else do you need. The 60ft cables are exactly all that you need for the initial setup.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "no hard drive", "Author": "Danice Sweet", "ReviewID": "R1MZ1TZ294TRNB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "didn't know it wouldn't work without a hard drive.
