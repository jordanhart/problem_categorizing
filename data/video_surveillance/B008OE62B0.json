{"Reviews": [{"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "YTSEJAM \"Jeffro\"", "ReviewID": "RD7AIRAQUJFX9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had two 8 channel Zmodo DVR's (one was returned due to bad channel inputs), and two 16 channel Zmodo DVR's.  Lets just say I have pretty good experience with this company's CCTV equipment.I have 24 cameras installed in and around my home connected to 16 and 8 channel Zmodo DVRs.  My friends and family think I am crazy, or a pervert, or both.  I don't care.I can view my cameras from my Android based tablet and phone, both using \"IP Cam View Pro\" the absolute BEST app for viewing Zmodo DVR's.  Contact me if you need help setting up this app with your DVR.  I can also help with your router and port forwarding if you need it.I do love these DVR's even though the directions are written by an idiot, and I say this strongly because Zmodo can pay someone with decent english skills to re-write the manuals so that they make sense.  When you take your DVR out of the box.  Take the manual and CD and throw them away.  They're useless.Make sure you set the \"maintain\" feature to be enabled for a daily reboot.  Without this, they will eventually stop responding via network (browser or your phone).Each DVR I have uses a different active-x Internet exploder based program to view the channels.  They all suck.  But what they do nicely is show you the video.  It's not HD, but we don't need HD to see when the UPS driver is coming down the drive, or your buddies are throwing cigarette butts in your yard.This is OT, but before throwing out the camera that gets really blurry (and it will), take it completely apart and unscrew the lens from the circuit board and clean.  These may work outdoors, but they're not sealed in anyway.  They let moisture in and get dirty relatively quick.  Oh, and the IR LED's can go bad, or something that triggers them goes bad.  Overall, I've had decent luck with the cameras, and for $65 you can get 4 new cameras, each coming with 60' of cable, mounts, and the power adapter.There is other software that Zmodo \"says\" works with their DVR(s), but I have done nothing but wasted time installing it and uninstalling it after trying different things they suggest.Bottom line, they are pretty good for how cheap they're priced at.  I have 4 out of 32 cameras die or piss me off enough to get slammed on the ground.  I had one 8 channel DVR get RMA'd due to bad inputs.  And their top of the line 16 channel DVR with 16 audio inputs and all the bells and whistles, it's network connection would die frequently and stop responding.  It would require a reboot to work again.  Actually, I've had many network issues with the DVR's that use the same active-x software.Getting the videos off the DVR's is a painfull process.  I have one DVR where the .264 files that it saves is skewed out of aspect.  The resolution of the videos you get are 700x200 instead of something that's 4:3 aspect.Zmodo's support crew is very friendly, but they don't have a problem telling you DVR you bought from them isn't covered by warranty.", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "works but...", "Author": "Kevin Sr.", "ReviewID": "RGLU5DJQSLQB9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered one of these 16 channel dvrs without hard drive. It came quickly and in one piece but when everything is up and running the dvr decides to record constantly instead of recording by motion like I set and saved it. I go through the process again and the same thing happens. Also I haven't been able go online and view my cameras. I'm hoping there is a software upgrade to fix the issue.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Zmodo DVR.", "Author": "Charles W.

If this unit is in a storage closet, this is not an issue, however, I installed this unit in a quarters where there are living occupants and they can notice the difference from their prior QSee unit. The cheap fans are the cause of this and they had to be replaced to accommodate their needs.Build Quality:The casing is a flimsy piece of sheet metal which was not a concern for me (as a supplier and for the consumer) since the unit is going to be stationary for the entirety of its life, however, this may be a concern for some.User Manual:This is essentially worthless. The manual is written in elementary school English and contains many mistakes. You will learn more by \"toying\" with the unit than reading the manual.The unit buttons:The buttons on the unit are annoying. after about 30 seconds of navigating the user interface on the unit will make you appreciate the remote control. The unit makes a very obnoxious sound when buttons are pressed on the actual dvr. Fortunately, this sound is not made when the remote is used.Overall:I would recommend this unit if:Either the fans were replaced or it is stored in a location where noise wouldn't matter.If you are looking for a low cost to performance ratioOther Thoughts:This unit does not come with a hard drive. I used a 3.5 inch desktop drive, however, I had to install it sideways in the unit due to space limitations; if you are planning on installing more than one drive, I would recommend purchasing 2.5 inch laptop drives.", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Product!", "Author": "Techman \"destinpc\"", "ReviewID": "REN02CVF93JCC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price, this DVR is amazing.

Wow, never dreamed this 16-ch Zmodo DVR would be so easy to install. It came with case top unattached along with the separate hard drive I had ordered so I did not have to remove the case.  I installed the hard drive by hooking up two cables and inserting four small provided screws (60 seconds). I attached the case with the screws provided. I had been running a different brand of DVR and the Zmodo interfaced easily, old one out, new one in (five minutes).  Turned the power on (don't forget the in/out switch on the back) and the unit powered up and instructed me to format the hard drive.  You do that from the settings mode on screen with a few simple clicks. At the end of this process (5 min), everything froze and I had to restart the DVR (probably normal). I then inputted the settings, including those for each camera and everything just started working. (I inputted each camera setting, then found there is an ALL cameras setting.) Conveniently, a staff member had just entered the building so I searched for their entry video on camera 15 and guess what, there it was! Very easy to install, very inexpensive, and seems to actually provide a better quality picture than our old, more expensive, much heavier DVR.  I strongly recommend the Zmodo DVRs.", "Date": "July 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "ricraf", "Author": "richard martinez", "ReviewID": "R8LDLWKLN428V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this product is excellent,This is my second purchase from zmodo,I had to purchase another dvr due to lightning damage.i did not hesitate to buy it from zmodo once again.i love this unit.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do not purchase", "Author": "Jermaine Wells \"jdogg38115\"", "ReviewID": "R32C81MKNBA15D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was such a disappointment for DVR that had potential with all the package features.

This dvr does ALL what it suppose to do.The only thing I don't liked is that when I bought it, the headline on the offer mentioned a 1TB hard drive (that is fixed now I see) and of course it not have any drive... just for common sense I realized that for that price should NOT have a drive, so I checked around and find the correct info. Then ordered a separated drive (by the way, very easy to install)I could have made \u200b\u200bthe order and after receiving the dvr claim the drive, because that way is how was on the offer (I can show my email order confirmation with the original posting), but I would never do that to the people of Amazon.

I ordered this item to monitor my business and upon arrival was quite shocked that the unit I received was not intact. The cover was loose and in fact was not even attached, nor were the screws even in the box. Despite this defect, I fixed it and proceeded to connect it because my other unit was old and had crashed. Despite the units battered arrival, installation was super easy and I had it online and running in no time. It was at that moment that I realized the unit was a stand alone unit, which means it does not include the hard drive. The description was a bit misleading in the details because it mentions all its wonderful ability to record videos etc. While this is true, it can only do this with the addition of a hard drive, which must be purchased seperately. I ended up buying one and installing it and the DVR malfunctioned and failed to record. I contacted the company and they agreed to replace the DVR  after I shipped the defective one back. I requested through Amazon a return and the company keeps sending me emails with their return address. I explained it has to be initiated through Amazon but they keep sending me direct emails with their address and not a return through Amazon. Because I cannot have a lapse in monitoring at my business, I bought another unit from them until the defective return could be resolved however to date nothing has been handled through Amazon. Given my experience and the fact that I am a technical gal, I have decided to just keep the defective unit and repair it myself (although it looks refurbished already) and cut my losses. I am giving the item 3 stars because I do believe the product itself is a good one, but is more of a seller issue. They were very nice but the issue was never resolved. On a better note, they do ship quick and with the second shipment, the packaging was much better and that unti worked just fine after I installed the hard drive.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$139.99", "Features": "Plug-n-Play\nRecording Modes: Manual, Schedule, Motion Detection, Alarm, Motion Detection & Alarm supported\nDisplay and Records 480 fps\nRemote Access\nUSB Thumb Drive Backup", "Name": "Zmodo ZMD-DC-SBN6 16CH H.264 Real-time Security Surveillance DVR with Internet & Smartphone Monitoring CCTV System - No hard Drive", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31iUmkaAtnL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008OE62B0"}}
