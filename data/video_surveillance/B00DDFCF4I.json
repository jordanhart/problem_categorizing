{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best of Both Worlds (Wifi and RF)", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R1W5156DW850ZR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I held out buying a new baby monitor until this one was released because I liked the fact that it was an RF signal between the monitor and the camera, but there was also an option to view remotely via WiFi on an iPhone.  This monitor fulfilled both of these perfectly.  The RF signal is much more reliable than WiFi, which means that through the night, I don't have to worry about missing either of the babies waking up or having issues.  But any other time, I can fire up the iphone and monitor, whether I'm outside or out to dinner with a babysitter staying at home.  The picture is beautiful.  I'm sure there may be better definition pictures on other monitors, but it's big and clear and that's all I need from a baby monitor.  It has 2 way voice, a zoom option and displays the temperature, all more useful than I thought they would be.  Easy to set up, and easy to use.  Honestly, couldn't be more excited for this monitor after our previous, cheaper video monitor for baby #1.  I have the camera with the ability to pan, and have no complaints about this either.(One note:  If the panning seems like it isn't working, check to make sure that you aren't zoomed in.  That was about 10 frustrating, troubleshooting minutes of my life I won't get back)First time ever writing a review.  This monitor is worth it, and since it is new, I'd thought it might be helpful for those afraid to take a chance.", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for crazy cat ladies", "Author": "S. Peterson \"theswedishchef\"", "ReviewID": "R33OBPH4JPD4LT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm letting my daughter use this to watch her cat. I did something wrong in parenting my daughters because they both turned out to be 26-year-old cat ladies. All they do is talk about their cats and tell me stupid and uninteresting cat stories. Now one of my daughters is using this unit to watch and listen for her cat when it's in the backyard. Normally you wouldn't get any stories about cats while they are outside and you are inside. Not with this unit. She can see the cat, listen to the cat (even in the dark) and tell me more cute things her cat does I don't give a crap about. Thank God she hasn't realized that she can take pictures with this thing. If she does, she will start sending those to me, too. At that moment I predict this unit will have a \"malfunction\" and no longer be able to take cat pictures.If this thing works on cats, it should work just fine for babies or old people with dementia. I'm OK with baby and old people stories. Those are cute. But cats are cats. When one gets sick you can put it to sleep and get another one for free. You can't do that with people (unless you're in Denmark or something). My daughter even talks to her cat through this thing. Good God, where did I go wrong? The cat looks around for her and she thinks that's cute and then calls me to tell me that. That's not what cell phones are for. Cell phones are for things like, \"Mom just burned herself making a Vodka drink. I'm taking her to the hospital, again.\" Cell phones are not for telling that your cat looked at the camera unit she you said, \"Hey Grover!\" I was in an important meeting when you called to tell me about your cat. I only answered because there might have been a chance your mother was on fire, again. So, in conclusion, this unit works for cats and most likely babies and probably old people with dementia.", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "ok, but not stellar", "Author": "J. York", "ReviewID": "R9CQM09APDX4H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The LorexBaby Care 'n' Share baby monitor includes everything you need to have a full mobile video feed to keep an eye and an ear on your bundle of joy.  The kit consists of a broadcast module that you place in the room with the baby and a handheld receiver module that you carry around with you.I found the range of the LorexBaby kit to be quite good.  I have a fairly large house (~3000 square feet) and I was able to go anywhere in my house, upstairs or down, and I never lost reception or had difficulties.  I do have a newer house with an open floor plan, so there aren't as many walls to go through as older houses, so that may have helped me.  No setup is required, and the kit does not use your wifi network by default; everything works the moment you power it on.Picture quality isn't what you'd get on a high definition television, but you can see what is going on in the cradle.  The camera has an automatic nightvision mode so you can even see in the dark.  This works well and gives you a usable view at all times of the day/night.  The camera viewing angle is fairly limited so you have to be careful with how you direct the camera.  This makes it acceptable for a cradle or playpen, but not usable for monitoring an entire room or large play area.The receiver module has a band of LEDs that light up when your baby is making noise.  Even if you have the audio muted, you can keep an eye on these and then listen in when you see them lighting up.  This way you don't have to listen to the hiss of the microphone all day but can still tell when the baby needs attention.The receiver module has a built-in rechargeable battery so that you don't have to leave it plugged in all the time.  With video display enabled, I was able to use this for about 2 hours before it ran out of power.  Battery life goes up considerably if you use audio-only.  I like that the receiver module has a small arm that slips out to hold it upright so you can set it on the counter like a picture frame.A few other features of the LorexBaby Care 'n' Share are a temperature sensor, a microphone for talking to your baby, and a remotely controlled nightlight that you can use to give the baby some light.  All of these work fine.  The night light puts out the faintest of light and wouldn't help you walk around the room but does give the baby a little light if they like that.  Voice quality when using the microphone is pretty bad.  I tried talking to my wife and she had a hard time understanding me.  You can add a microSD card to the receiver module so that you can record footage of your baby or to take  snapshots.I am having a significant problem with my LorexBaby Care 'n' Share that will cause me to contact Lorex support.  The battery in the receiver module often refuses to charge.  I can plug in the receiver and use it on wall-power all day long, but 99% of the time, it doesn't actually charge the battery.  This leaves me with a depleted battery, even if I had it turned off and plugged in all night long.  I'm assuming this is a hardware issue that will require Lorex to send me a replacement.My sister-n-law has a Philips baby monitor that she spent about $200 on.  It costs twice as much, but it is at least twice as nice.  For my money, I'd rather have the Philips unit.A few other notes after using for a month:+ the zoom feature works really well and has a very sharp/clear picture.- the zoom button broke within weeks of using the unit, it is not well built+ the small footprint of the camera is appreciated+ the night light is useful- the bluish color of the night light could be improved upon+ the included cable clips for mounting the camera are appreciated; babies like to pull on stuff+ colors are sometimes off (though no worse than other baby cameras that I've seen)+ the temperature alarm feature is appreciated- lets us know if the baby's room gets too hot or cold", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Too expensive unless you really don't want to use wifi with your computer or smartphone", "Author": "Jonathan Strawn", "ReviewID": "R2TBPOWHOLQ4CQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "There are cheaper, high quality cameras available that do not require any additional purchase to view over the internet, such as EasyN FS-613A-M136 Wireless WiFi Pan/Tilt IP Camera Two-Way Audio, Email FTP Motion Alert, Remote Mobile View, DDNS, UPNP, 64 Channel Software, Windows & Mac Compatible or ImogenStudio QCP-A100 +Cam Video Security Accessory for Smartphones (White).The main claim for this setup is that it includes a remote screen you can use with no internet connection or other device.  Which is nice, if that is what you want.  The quality is fine, except that mount on the camera is very flimsy and loose, which means it will easily be bumped out of position.Otherwise, this is basically the same as many cheaper models that can be used with a setup that you probably already have installed in your house.", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Look Elsewhere If You Want a Network Baby Monitor That Works", "Author": "Kris", "ReviewID": "R33MKRH5XOBRQX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When it came time to buy a baby monitor for our son, I was looking for a monitor that allowed us to view the camera feed from our iOS devices over our local network as well as remotely via the Internet. Not sure which one to buy, I bought both this and the iBaby M3 Baby monitor for the iOS.The Lorex was attractive because it came with a display (via RF connection) and also functioned with iOS devices (via network). Not sure how we'd actually end up using a baby monitor, we felt this would give us some freedom and flexibility.When comparing the monitors, the cameras on the two units were similar in quality, and the audio on the Lorex was actually a bit better than the iBaby monitor (it seemed to be more sensitive and clear). The night vision on the iBaby monitor was much nicer, providing a field of view much greater than the IR \"focus area.\" The camera feed, however, was much smoother on the iBaby monitor; there seemed to be a lot of lost frames and delay on the Lorex.That said, the major difference was in usability. The iOS app for the Lorex was abysmal. I have some experience with Lorex products and was hoping they put a little more into the user interface of a baby monitor. Unfortunately, they didn't. The app had a bunch of information on the display that I just didn't care about (like the bitrate), and manipulating the camera position with the app was \"laggy\" at best--but in most cases it was simply unresponsive. That is, of course, when it didn't crash.But the iOS app wasn't the only way to view the camera field. As I said, one of the major selling points was the included display. However, the display ended up being the most frustrating part of the Lorex monitor. The little purple \"joystick\" in the lower right hand corner was literally useless. It is meant to be used as a directional stick (to move the selection around on the screen) as well as a input button (to select what was highlighted). When trying to actually use it, it would jump around the screen (moving more than once when the stick was pressed in a direction), and the selection button seldom worked; Getting it to select instead of moving the selection on the screen was nearly impossible. This resulted in a very frustrating experience and I quickly put the display aside.It is also important to note that the camera broadcasts wirelessly to the display, and the display shares the connection to the network via the base. This means if you want to use the iOS apps, the display must be \"docked\" in its base. I knew this prior to purchasing, but it really doesn't make sense from a real world perspective. You can't use both at the same time.Setup for the Lorex monitor was actually a breeze, which was why I gave it two stars. If you follow the directions, you should have no problem getting the monitor working. However, with the easy setup comes a complete lack of customization in setup. If you're comfortable with setting network devices up (setting IPs and ports), then you may find this pretty frustrating. Lorex's solution for feeding the camera feed to remote devices is to route everything through a third party server. I prefer to connect directly to the camera using my IP address with port forwarding. In contrast, the iBaby monitor gives you much more control over configuration. Of course, this may be a personal preference based on your comfort level with setting up network devices.In the end, I felt like Lorex tried to include so much functionality that it failed at doing any one thing particularly well. There's supposedly even a DVR function but my frustration with the monitor prevented me from exploring these advanced features (honestly, I didn't get an impression that these would be well executed, either). The iBaby M3 Baby monitor for the iOS was a much more straight forward device that may lack some of the features of the Lorex monitor, but does what it's supposed to do very well. Ironically, we love the fact that we don't have another display laying around--we get live audio from our iPhones/iPads with the displays off and can view him easily any time, too.

H.", "ReviewID": "R3S30AGT05US6N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was our 3rd video baby monitor. We had a Summer Infant that was good and worked well for Baby 1. Then we switched to another Lorex for the improved video quality. We got this one with Baby 2 to have the pan/tilt over the crib and to have the 2 cameras at once. I have bought hundreds of things on Amazon and this is the first time I've felt the NEED to write a review. My husband and I love all the features of this monitor - the video quality was exceptional compared to other brands.The battery stopped holding more than an hour's charge after couple months, we adjusted and would bring the power cable out of our bedroom when we needed it. Then a couple of weeks ago, the battery door on the parent receiver popped open because the battery had swollen so much. Assuming the company would send a new battery, I logged a technical support ticket. Then I heard nothing. About a week later, a got a notice saying my ticket was closed. So I called. A very nice technical person said sometimes that happens (really?) and she'd forward my ticket to Customer Support for a replacement.Then I started interacting with CS. They told me I would need to pay to send the receiver back to them and they would assess it and send me replacement within 5-7 days. I followed up via their web service to clarify that I would need to pay to send back a defective device and be without a monitor for about 2 weeks. They confirmed and said their policy is to have the customer pay shipping one way for replacements and they would pay the other. I could call and put a $40 deposit down if I wanted the replacement first.So, I called to talk to Lorex Customer Service / Support. Having waited about 35 mins on hold, listening to their message about \"having to be in warranty\", \"please try to help yourself using FAQs on website first\" and \"be sure to have your return authorization number\"...I decided this is not a customer service oriented company. (Look at other Lorex products on Amazon...you'll see a trend.) Finally, the CS Rep picks up and after I asked several questions and expressed my disappointment at the level of customer service, I was told \"we don't do customer service, we do replacements under warranty.\" (really?!) I asked to be put through to a supervisor, whom he assured me would have the same answers...then transferred me to reception? After another 30 mins, the CS Supervisor told me that if I had read the warranty, it said I would have to pay to ship the monitor to them. I explained that it was a defective product and shouldn't have to pay anything. (I do understand the deposit process, as people are not returning products.) He finally (rudely) issued me a shipping label and hung up on me.You can buy this product, but hope your works perfectly.

We were required to first speak to a technical representative before they would send a replacement.  After doing so, the tech's analysis was that the camera unit was faulty, not the handheld so we'd need to have the camera replaced.We then received an RMA# but we were told that we would not receive the replacement part until they received the faulty part.  I informed them that this was not acceptable because this is our primary device for monitoring our baby on a daily basis.  I also informed the customer rep that I thought the handheld or both may be faulty and they should just send us a brand-new unit instead of only trying the camera module.  She told me \"ok\" but then we only received the camera module.After swapping the module, we found the problem persisted.  I called customer support once more and was on hold for nearly an hour before a rep said she'd have to transfer me to a manager.  Again, I was on hold for quite a while.  Long enough to realize I was sick of dealing with Lorex and decided to initiate a return through Amazon.  Amazon's customer support, as always, is stellar beyond belief and they rectified the issue immediately.Bottom-line: this is, in my opinion, still the best \"do-it-all\" monitoring product on the market.  Even with the bugs, problems, and terrible customer support - if you're looking for a do-it-all device then this will likely be the best you can find.  My problem is that the best you can find in this category just ain't good enough.  We ended up splitting the devices and purchasing 3 separate items (nearly the same cost as this and works a ton better):1) Foscam IPCam for video and backup audio monitoring - plus we can use this as a nanny cam and home security, if we wished (versatile win!)2) We got the Philips DECT for dependable audio monitoring - much better range and clarity than the Lorex3) Finally, we got a remote sensor weather monitoring device for monitoring both temp and humidity in his room (we're in phoenix, it's dry, we have to keep an eye on his humidity because his skin reacts poorly) - if you don't need humidity monitoring then you can skip this since the Philips DECT has temp monitoring.Hope this helps.", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "I don't hate it, but I'm not very happy either", "Author": "Quaked", "ReviewID": "R2ENGDMG9INJIQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We used to have a Summer Infant monitor, but when the touch screen broke and it was stuck in the zoomed in view, we decided to get another one. All the reviews on this product were decent. The thing that attracted us most to this product was the fact that you can remotely view the monitor from your smart phone (i.e. from work, school, wherever there's a digital signal), and that you can even take pictures of your baby. I also appreciated that the product says that you receive the video on your computer. And I liked the idea that it can play white noise to help your baby sleep. My Summer Infant had a decent video quality, so I figured that since I'm paying more, and plus the advertisement makes it seem that way, I am sure I would get a much better video than what I was getting with the Summer Infant. I was sold. So this is what I found when I got the product.THE GOODSet up was fairly easy. Just plug in all the products and plug in your ethernet cable into the base and you're up and running in a few short minutes. I appreciate being able to see what temperature the room is, so I can know whether or not I need to go in a cover my baby with a blanket or just leave things the way they are. I love the remote viewing. The iPhone app was free, and set up took a little bit of figuring out, but once that got going, we were ready. The trick is to have everything plugged in and the ethernet cable plugged in so that you can pair your phone to your monitor. Since the camera is over my baby's bed, the only time remote viewing comes in handy is when my baby is napping while I'm away. So it's nice that I get to see my baby sleeping while I'm away.THE BADThe video quality is disappointing at best. The picture on my monitor looks NOTHING like what the company advertises. I was under the impression that the picture quality would be amazing, or at least better than the Summer Infant. Sorry, it didn't happen. The camera lens on the monitor is probably a 1 mega pixel camera, at best. The video feed is choppy, it lags and frequently has blackouts for about a second.Even more disappointing than the video quality is the remote viewing. You experience the lag and choppy video quality most when watching from your smart phone or tablet. The video constantly blacks out about every ten seconds. My home wi-fi is fine, and my work wi-fi is fine. Both wi-fi networks are great, so why is my video quality so choppy? The only reason is the monitor itself. I could be at home, and the video quality will still be choppy and black out.The sound quality is terrible. On the Summer Infant, the sound quality can be compared to being outside the room with the door closed. The Lorex sounds like a big cardboard box placed in front of a loud speaker. The sound quality is obnoxious. It's so bad that we don't even bother using the sound.The white noise was a disaster. We tried to get it to work, but all it does is scroll through the different sounds. The monitor plays each sound for about five seconds and then moves on. My baby can sleep through the rain, but not the waves.Hope this helps you in your decision-making process. $200 is a lot to spend on something that is just ok at best.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Poor engineering, poor customer service.", "Author": "Lev Ratinov", "ReviewID": "R3LN7UI0ZH9RN1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My parents live abroad and I have an emotionally genius wife who has suggested a baby cam as means of letting my parents interact with our newborn.

I loved the fact that it would support multiple cameras, and the WiFi option allowed me to check in on our baby when I was out of town.

Nothing like that horrible feeling when you wake up in the middle of the night, check the monitor, and find out that it has disconnected without warning.  What good is a monitor that you can't rely on?Next up...battery issues.  After a few months, our battery life started to decline significantly.  The battery swelled so much that it broke the back of the case and bulges out of the unit.  The charge now lasts less than 10 minutes.In order to exchange for a new unit under warranty, LOREX wanted me to mail the unit back to them, and they would inspect it, and send a new replacement in 5-7 business days. What? I will have no monitor for 2 weeks? Nice customer service. For $40, they offer an advanced replacement. We took this option, and they shipped us a new unit (this still took over a week).  When it arrived, the unit was useless! It did not work properly (constantly went in and out of range, and beeped every time you touched a button, regardless of volume settings).  To make matters worse, the battery would not hold a charge at all. We plugged it in overnight, and it still would not function without being plugged in.  We called customer service AGAIN, and they agreed to send us a new unit.The new unit arrived a week and a half later, and at first I thought we were finally in the clear.  I used it for a few days, and it seemed to work fine.  Then I tried to set it up with the WiFi cradle.  The first unit worked fine with the cradle.  This one goes dark and says \"USB PC Monitor Mode\" on the screen whenever you plug it into the WiFi Cradle.  This isn't listed anywhere on the web site, or in any of the documentation.  LOREX tech support has no idea how to fix it, and asked me to send it back (and, of course, after they receive it, they will send me another replacement in 5-7 business days).  Wow...three strikes guys.  You suck, and you're officially out.So, to summarize, I have three of these units on hand right now, and none of them work properly.

I was elated and contacted Lorex.  had called customer service representative 2 days ago regarding the issue and he told me to fax the amazon receipt along with my shipping address and phone number and the model of the monitor information and that Lorex would send me a replacement. Its been 5 days that I faxed all the information and I have not heard a word from anyone at Lorex. Not happy with the customer support so far. I then created a ticket on the Lorex website hoping that I would get a response then but till date I have not been contacted by Lorex.

I purchased the BB4325X and was overall disappointed. It's possible that, had I purchased another unit, my ratings would more closely reflect the average users' opinion. Do make sure the ratings you're reading apply to the monitor you're considering.Pros- I found this very easy and quick to setup as a standalone baby monitor (not using the wifi features)- The camera has a large range of motion from side to side and up (but not down)Cons- The marketing imagery is totally deceptive and doesn't at all represent the image you can expect to see on the unit's display, perhaps even with a camera studio.- Range of motion down is what's needed, because invariably you're trying to look down into a crib. This camera doesn't angle down far enough to do that well, so you need to rig a way to mount it with a tilt.- The zoom is awful, whole unusable. When you zoom in (digitally) it always defaults to the top left corner of the frame as a the full frame image. Unfortunately, only the top left corner isn't lit by the infrared illumination, so you see a black image (or something mildly better). To make matters worse, you can scroll to the center of the image, but the scrolling is so slow, it makes it a 60 second process to zoom.- Wifi android app is very poor. Be sure to check out the reviews on the android market if you intend to use this functionality.- The wifi is overall very limited.

The sightline is good - sometimes what the monitor can actually see is impaired on a few - and the resolution is nice. It also picks up really well. As another reviewer noted, the nighttime sight is good but you lose distance, so you have to set it closer. This has been the same with all of the monitors I've tried, and the picture on this is great during both times. We have a two-story place and that is sometimes an issue as well, but this did fine, picking up both upstairs and downstairs.I've enjoyed the extras this monitor brings as well, like room temperature readings, the ability to add more cameras, the ability to transmit this to other devices (this is the first I've tried to do this, and I like it)  snap n share, and others. I like my house cool and sometimes worry I leave the wrong vents open when worn down, so the temperature gauge helps and is pretty on. It deviates maybe 2 degrees depending, but gives a great baseline to check. The sharing technology is nice too, and allows me to photo when I think moments would be great.

Well, I'll try to do the best I can to describe my experience with this camera. I do a lot of reviews, because I think its one of the key ways consumers should purchase.I got this baby monitor because it was on 'the countdown to black friday' deal. I would never pay over $100 I don't think. Let me just tell you first, I got the camera/monitor and then had to return the first one. The camera died the first night! I called tech support with Lorex and they told me to return. Ugh. But I did get the replacement in 2 days from Amazon and it has had no other issues per se.To start, the monitor has a crisp view with infrared technology (night vision looks great!). It also has easy controls but some aren't compatible with the specific camera. You can zoom in (one view) and pan around the area that you zoom into only. It does not pan/tilt on the regular view. The camera is pretty simple itself and has volume control, on/off switch and button for manual night light operation (You can remotely turn it off/on as well) However, I think the light is way to bright for a 'night light' so I don't use it.I was a little disappointed that this monitor is 'snap and store' but doesn't provide the mini SD card, nor does it come with a usb cord to plug into the computer. Kind of stupid. But just another way to make more money for add-on's I guess. And the soothing sounds are so dumb. There is the rain, etc which is nice and then all of the sudden one of the music options are seagulls at the ocean! The loudest darn birds ever...why would my baby want to hear screeching seagulls!!! And you can just select the 1-5 music selects and stay on them. They don't repeat, but go to the next 'sound', once again, it rotates back to the darn seagulls. So I just don't use that feature either.There is another pro to this camera. And that is, it does have power save mode that allows the monitor (and sound) to mute/turn off until sound is heard. I really like that feature. Also, if you want to just turn the monitor off, you can do so and the sound still plays. However, I think a few times my baby was crying and it didn't have the sound turn back on again. So not sure if there was a faulty issue there or not.Overall, I am fairly happy with the purchase. I like the clear view of the child and the simplicity of the controls. It can mount on the bottom or on the back so its versatile as well.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Choose a different monitor if you're a heavy swing user (& my speaker quit after a few months)", "Author": "Cupcake", "ReviewID": "R1PM8E3NU4HPOF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "---Update, a few months later: The speaker on the monitor no longer works. Other reviewers can restart sound by restarting the monitor. Not me. Even removing the battery and resetting the settings didn't help. Sound seems to be dead. The camera is still picking it up (you can see from the sound level monitor lights), but you can't hear a peep, which other reviewers have also noted. Obviously, no sound makes the monitor pretty worthless unless you're in the next room. I tested it & the sound on the camera does still work (but I don't use that feature anyway, since my disembodied voice doesn't exactly fill my baby with untold joy). I'm contacting Lorex next week (12/30/13)& I'll update my review accordingly.---For a daytime monitor, or for a very still baby, I'd give it 4 stars. It's packed with lots if extra features (photo capture, intercom, temp sensor, etc), the daytime image is good, and the screen in big! But the night vision, with or without the nightlight, is awful, particularly with any motion. If your baby's in a swing, she'll be nothing more than a big white blur. I'd give it 2 stars for night, one star if you're using it with a swing. The daytime video isn't great with motion, either, but because regular-light video is inherently clearer, it's less of an issue in the day.While the other features are a nice bonus, they're no really important enough to me to sway the rating more one way or another. The price is pretty good, though, so based on that, I'd give it 3 1/2 if I could. Signal is pretty solid (gets a few more dead zones than some others, but with the antenna up, I can find a clear spot in most rooms of our large 16,000 sf reinforced concrete building), but not quite as reliable as the two others I've used.I really love the temp sensor. We're in an old high school building with no central AC, and erratic heat,  and different parts of the building can be more than 10 degrees different. Open a window, and it's even more dramatic--so this is a wonderful feature, which I think would really give you peace of mind with an newborn in any old or poorly insulated building.Interface is fairly intuitive, though I didn't always guess the icons at first try.Battery life is decent, several hours-- certainly not 8 with video, but I trust it for a solid 4.I hope to get some more life out of it when I've weaned her off napping in her swing, because I do like the photo and temp features, but for motion, this monitor's not you best choice, even for the price.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product with a few quirks", "Author": "J.

Due to the recent arrival of my niece and nephew, I decided to try this system out.  Over the past few days it has proven its worth by allowing me to view the baby room while staying in another room nearby watching television.  As a computer guy, in this review I share a few of the other features that you might be interested in.First and foremost, the wireless camera does require a plug in but no video cables.  The range of the camera and completely wireless monitor is about 75ft and displays black and white video most of the time.  The audio levels on the monitor can be adjusted to a high level so you can hear what is happening in the other room, even low whispers.  The camera does have good night vision but note that the red infared LEDs can be seen at night.  Red LED lights have no effect on baby.The Lorex WL3520 wireless and rechargeable LCD monitor has some fun features to play with.  You can play audio back into the room which consists of a short series of soothing beach and bird sounds.  You will also enjoy the talk feature that lets you speak to anyone near the camera and they can hear you very well.  Remember, the monitor is playing back the sound in the room so two way communication is possible.  The zoom is weak and not really worth playing with because panning is slow and the video itself is very pixelated.My favorite feature of the camera and monitor is the remote light that you can switch on and off.  Turning the light on always gets a reaction.The snap and share feature requires a micro SD card which is not included.  The snap shots and videos are low quality but do help capture special moments for sharing on Facebook with friends.You cannot find Windows or Mac drivers for this baby monitor at the LorexTechnology website which disappointed me because I thought the USB port could have been a great way to extend the view range of the monitor using standard WIFI networking in the home.In conclusion, this is a good baby monitor system that is ready to run out of the box.  Plug in the camera, turn on the monitor and its displaying video.  The video is not great but there are few systems in the price range that are as functional and display anything better.  While the maximum range is only 75ft in a home, it should still be considered if you sleep near the baby room and seek that extra measure of assurance during the night.

Feeling cheap isn't really a con as long as it works though.- Wireless connection isn't as good as I would like, we live in a ranch style home and it works everywhere up stairs but if my wife goes in the basement to do laundry, she looses signal in the laundry room which is pretty disappointing. Our house isn't that big but is in the shape of an L so as far as direct line of sight, the monitor while in the laundry room would have to look through the ground in order to communicate with the camera, the straight line distance is only about 40'.

Quiet noises like his music will not necessarily turn on the light and background noise but talking/crying will.  This is nice.  We have a 2 yr old too that still has his old monitor (hopefully if we buy another camera for our new one they link well together and can watch both on one???) so b/w the two of them I hear a lot of their music box noise throughout the night when they wake up to turn it on.  At least now, I'm only down to one. :)  The turn radius and pan is nice too so I can watch them playing in the room.  My biggest complaint is ALL of the buttons and the various locations.  I hate that the volume buttons on the side are right next to the music option buttons...I've hit that by accident a couple of times and it woke him up. Also, the touch buttons on the front are very sensitive so I will hit something and then I'm wondering what I hit for a second.

With a 16 GB SD micro card you can record the whole night and should a fall happen, you have evidence to prove what actually happened.

Yes, each camera can not only transmit audio and video to the receiver, but also you can transmit audio back.

The camera has automatic focus, and digital zoom, yet optical zoom would be better. And there is no remote alignment support, you have to adjust it manually. Also while the touch controls work, it would be better to replace the, with old style buttons.

The Summer Infant Best View Handheld Color Video Monitor, Sliver/White completely borked our wifi.2. The Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision just felt really cheap and we didn't like it (I know we returned it, but I didn't write a review so I can't remember exactly what we didn't love).3. The Lorex LW2004 Video Baby Monitor with 2.4-inch LCD and Automatic Night Vision had wonky connection stability, lots of beeping, super low volume, poor touch capability...So I was eager to try out this Lorex.PROS* Works right out of the box--you just plug everything in and it works. I didn't even need instructions...even for the Settings.* Decently clear picture.* You can have up to four cameras and view them all at the same time (vs. the Summer's two cameras where you had to flip the A/B switch).* I got a signal at the far back of our yard (at least 40 yards). It did blink to \"out of range\" but then popped right back up. Be sure to put the antenna up!* It picks up sound well--I had it in my son's room upstairs and it picked up my daughter crying downstairs (which I heard when I was taking my test walk into the back yard).MEHS*We didn't need a night light so I didn't care about this...but if we did, it's really close to the baby since it's (obviously) on the camera which is placed close to the crib. So it's not like you could use it for changing a diaper across the room.CONS* Plastic units feel cheap.* The pan/tilt function is manual.* The kickstand for the monitor is almost useless--it doesn't lock in place so turns easily and the unit falls over.Overall, I give it four stars for an \"I like it\" rating.

The kids sleep in mats on the floor so it was annoying that I needed to prop up the back of the old camera to tilt lower.I have no problem with the signal strength.  I live in a three-story townhouse with hardwood floors in between.  The camera is located at the basement and I have the parent unit monitor in the kitchen.  The resolution is good with a nice color contrast.  Night vision works OK even it is completely dark.I love the soothing sound effects.  You can choose waves, rainforest, rains, etc., and you can control the volume and selection from the parent unit.  No musical lullabye though.

It sounds pretty basic, but there's a lot going on with this package with regards to features and functionality. So let's take a look at see how it all works.SETUPOut of the box you've basically got the camera with removable stand, monitor, 2 identical power adapters, users manual, quick start guide, and the optional wall-mounting hardware. The actual setup is probably one of the easiest I've used. You basically just turn them on and they're already paired and ready to go. That's it. In fact, this is one of the few instances where I found the quick start guide to actually add more confusion than help. Mostly because it has instructions for 2 different type of cameras, depending on which one you have.The only useful note provided is that it's suggested you charge the monitor before first use, as it is battery powered. Although if you have it plugged in, that's really not necessary as it's designed to work on AC or Battery.CAMERAThe camera is an above average day/night camera that's screwed into a pedestal which allows for plenty of angle adjustment. With this installed you can simply set it on a desk or mount it to the wall. It is removable if you don't want to use it though.  Otherwise you've just got a small antenna on top, volume control, on/off switch, a light button on top, and power indicator.Of course there is a speaker and microphone built-in so you can playback music and talk via the monitor, which we'll go into more below. The speaker is pretty basic and doesn't provide great audio quality. It's somewhat tiny and muffled, which your child may or may not care about. It's just there to give you some basic sound output and that's about it.As with most microphones, it's equally basic with regards to how it will pretty much pickup any sound in the room. There is no noise cancellation or adjustment available as there are with some of the higher-end monitor systems.The picture quality this camera can provide is much better than any other camera I'e used in the past. The day-time images are bright and colorful and night-mode (using IR) works very well. It's as if the lights are still on, but in black & white of course. I did notice the IR sensors have a \"dead spot\" where the right 1/6 of the screen is not illuminated at night.MONITOR HARDWAREThe monitor is one of the best features of this system. It has a built-in color display that is surprisingly vivid, crisp, and detailed.  If anything, it's actually too bright at night time, although you'd likely just turn off the display anyways. Which you can do by simply pressing the power button once. The audio will still function of course, unless you hold down the button for a few seconds to power it off.Speaking of buttons, there are quite a few on this little gadget. On top is the power/display on/off button, camera light (allows you to remotely turn on/off the night light on the camera itself), record (video), and camera (screen shot). The latter 2 options will require a micro-SD card, which is located on the left along with volume +/-, and two controls to remotely play back music. Which as noted before, is going through some cheap speakers, so the quality isn't great.On the right-side is a Lock button that does what it says, which is to prevent any other buttons from being accidentally pressed. The \"Quad\" button brings up another very nice feature, which is the fact that you can use up to 4 cameras with a single monitor. This button switches between them or displays them all at once. Then you've got an A/V out jack (3.5mm cable not included), micro-USB, and power connector.On the back is an adjustable stand that works well enough. The front has 4 touch-sensitive controls including a talk button for talking to the baby via the camera, 2x digital zoom, camera button for toggling through multiple cameras, and menu button. I found them easy to use, but we'll go into the software below. Otherwise you've just got a 4-way joystick for getting through menus (or using an optional PTZ camera) and a couple of LED's on the left to indicate volume (in case you have it muted).MONITOR SOFTWAREYes, there was a lot happening with hardware, but the software has several useful features that are needed to get full use out of the monitor. Simply press the Menu button and the on-screen menu will appear. Using the joystick at the bottom right you can scroll through the options and press down to select or make changes. This is good to note otherwise certain changes won't take effect until you actually push down to make the selection effective.I won't go through every option, as you probably won't mess with most of them, and they're pretty easy to find by scrolling around. Basically you can do things such as change record quality, pair cameras, set date & time, language, alarm, etc. Speaking of alarm, you can set it to notify you of certain preset high/low temperatures. Which the camera does report the temp of the room, although I've found it to be 2-3 degrees on the warm side.REAL-WORLD USEWe found the wireless functionality to work perfectly. The monitor has an adjustable antenna on top that when extended, provided a strong signal anywhere in the house. Even over 150ft away, going through a floor, 2 doors, and multiple walls, it still had a strong clear signal and picture. As previously noted the picture quality is great for a baby monitor. Day or night we could see our 11 month old just fine.I'd still prefer the mic to not be quite so sensitive and/or at least have some adjustment so it doesn't pick up so much background noise. Even a quiet fan or quiet background music will transmit quite loudly. Our stand-alone audio-only monitor manages to filter all of that out. The monitor has a brightness setting, but when turning it down, it just made the image harder to see. Turning it up, and it became washed out.What I would really like to see is a dimmer switch or adjustment to actually control the back light. Otherwise all we can do now is turn the display on/off and use \"audio-only\" mode. Which is fine and hasn't really diminished it's functionality. What really does add to the functionality is the built-in battery for the monitor. This allows you to take it to another room and watch the baby while he/she is napping. It seems to be lasting about 4 hours or so, which does mean with our current use, won't quite make it a full day without a 2nd charge.The last feature we are missing is the ability to use a PC, Phone, or Tablet to remotely view the camera. As this package ships, you can only use the provided monitor. However, Lorex does sell a separate dock (Model# ACCWIFI11) that should provide that functionality. Although that does add cost and hardware to the system.PROS+ Excellent range+ Great camera picture quality+ Vivid display on monitor+ Video Record & snap-shot feature (with optional microSD)+ Night vision mode+ Two-way speaker+ Optional 4-camera capability+ Plenty of menu options and controls+ Battery powered monitor+ Very easy setupCONS- No built-in WiFi for Phone/PC viewing (optional dock sold separately)- No mic sensitivity adjustment- No back light control- Camera IR LED has a dead spot (night vision)- Battery life could be betterCONCLUSIONConsidering the price, features, functionality, and performance of this system, I think you're really getting a good bang for your buck. While there are some nice things I'd like to see improved or added, this would potentially add to the cost and reduce the value factor. So if you're looking for a solid video baby monitor system, especially if you want future camera expansion, I consider this one recommended with 4.5 stars.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Expected more from Lorex", "Author": "A. Hudson \"bisou bisou\"", "ReviewID": "R3QGXPOAKPYV09", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for several weeks. Lorex is a well known name in my household. I have bought their cameras for two years. I started with the Lorex LW241 LIVE sense Wireless Video Home Monitor. I then added two more cameras to the main unit and then purchased another monitor and camera. They are all compatible and durable. The only thing about the ones I own, they do not have a removable rechargeable battery. Basically I have to keep them plugged in and charging all the time because there is not battery to replace. That is the biggest con with the units I have and is a deal breaker if I was looking for a great system.This unit comes with a rechargeable battery which is nice. However, it does not please me as well as their other units. Looking at it in the box, it has this cheap look to it which is not what I expect from Lorex. My cameras and monitors from the LW241 are durable and look and feel great. With my other units Lorex sent out a miceo SD card which both the units take. However, with this newer one, they did not send out a card. It seems they are trying to cut cost down and try to make it look like they improved it but there really is not much there. Of course you have your built in memory to record but I liked it when they sent a small card, most people do not have them sitting around.The screen is the same size as my LW241; however, the unit is bigger and bulkier. It could have been sleeker, but they made it bulky. An improvement is the touch screen buttons on the right front of the unit, with they other the buttons had to be pushed straight on. I found the touch screen buttons a lot handier. But that is probably the only upgraded feature I could note. The toggle button on this unit looks really cheap. It just goes up and down and left and right, so not sure why they put a toggle button to begin with. My other unit, the kickstand is straight in the back and I have never knocked them over. On the newer model the kickstand is on one side on the back of the unit and turns! It is very cheap and does not keep the camera standing up well. I like the fact that you can read the temperature of where the camera is and be alerted if it changes. My other units has this as well though. Also, the other set I have has the time on both of the monitors and this newer one does not. Another feature they should have kept.As far as the picture, I expected it to be like the other units I had, but it worse. I have had this for weeks and was hoping I would grow to love it but the picture is not vibrant at all. My other unit is a lot clearer and has more color. I have tried to adjust the newer one but the only adjustment can be turning the brightness up and down, that did nothing. Also, the night view is very purple! Again, if you adjust the brightness, it just turns the purple up or down.The camera itself is the same size of the other units but it has a metal swivel bracket. Nice, but if you turn it too much one way, it falls out! I have had this happen every time I have tried to adjust the camera. It is very annoying! All of their cameras I own have a night light built in. It is on top and it s soft white light. It is nice but not worth buying the unit over.I was hoping this would grow on me but it never did. I did not have a range issue that other stated, I was able to use it through walls just fine and on the other side of my house. However, with the picture being so bad, it did not matter if the range was good or not.I personally could not recommend this camera. I love Lorex, I love the units I bought and noted at the top but with them not having a rechargeable battery, that is a deal breaker. Two years later you would hope a lot of improvements would be made, but I see a lot of corners that were cut and just a cheaper feeling unit with a mediocre picture at best.I think for the price point you could find something else. I would not feel safe having this as the main unit to watch my daughter sleep at night. Lorex tried but it seemed like they took features away instead of adding more in the two years. Also, the zoom to me is terrible. It zooms in the upper left corner, not the center. Other cameras I had that zoomed were actually zooming in what you were looking at and able to move the screen left or right. This one, just the upper left corner, I do not understand that.Not what I would expect from Lorex. They have good units but this is not one of them.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works great, decent range, wifi and access via internet darned good too!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1OR5QCFBYV2NY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this Lorex after reviewing a whole bunch of cameras, including pure internet ones like the Dropcam, Foscam etc. We wanted one that had a handheld monitor with a decent screen size for use in the house, that alerted us to sound and motion by turning on or transmitting sound/video when they occur,  and we didn't want one that eats up all our internet bandwidth streaming video to third party servers constantly (like the dropcam).I looked at the summer infant series but they were too pricey and the latest model was only available at toysrus, and only the add on camera was available at amazon.  I took a chance on this Lorex even though it was so new and I was not disappointed.The most important criteria for us was range and that was the first thing I tested.  I put the camera in one corner of the house (4000 SFT one floor home) and walked to the farthest corner.  About 3/4 of the way there I got the out of range message, but pulling up the antenna on the handheld monitor got me back in range again and I could pretty much walk anywhere in the home and stay in range with the antenna up.Once the range was verified, I checked the camera and all its functions.  The pan tilt is very good as is the zoom.  The pan tilt function does makes a light whirring noise as it operates but not loud enough to disturb the baby in my opinion.  The picture quality is sharp and clear.  I was able to very easily control all the functions from the handheld, including turning on/off the nightlight, turning on the \"lullabies\" (meh on the this as the sounds are generic such as surf, birds tweeting; would have been much more value if it could record and play mommies voice singing)!  The sound detection on the cameras is very good.  smallest noise near the camera is picked up and sent to the handheld monitor.  I have not yet installed the camera in its final resting place (they say 3FT or more away from the crib so tiny hands don' go reaching for power cords) but it seems easy enough with the included wall mount.  Camera has a switch to flip image over if you decide to mount it on the ceiling.  Camera also has ability to follow motion, so if you have a toddler crawling round the crib or the floor etc, the camera is supposed to pan/tilt to keep them in view.  We didn't try this feature out.Then I connected the second add on camera and paired that up.  I was able to select the camera or put both screens up on a \"quad view\" on the monitor and they were clear.  Sounds were being picked up from either camera and alerting the monitor as they should.  Pairing the second camera was simplicity itself; on the monitor, setup, add camera and pair it to Channel 2 (total 4 channels); monitor gives a 30 second countdown timer, press the pair button on bottom of camera and you are done.Next I tried the wifi cradle.  It supports wifi and ethernet.  I happen to have an ethernet port near where I put the cradle so connected it to that using the included ethernet cable.  Next I placed the monitor in the cradle (watch how you do this so it docks smoothly and mates all the way to the USB plug on the bottom of the cradle; its tricky).  Went to Google play store and downloaded the Lorex Care app onto our HTC One's (one is Tmobile and other Verizon).  Make sure your phones are using the wifi network in your home and then press search on the app.  It will find the wifi cradle and if not you can take a picture of the QR code on the device and it will find it; we didn't need to do this).  Default name is \"Camera\" and default password is 000000 (when you are all setup make sure you change the password)!  When you touch the \"Camera\" icon, you get the picture from the channel 1 camera!  To switch to the another camera, touch Channel button and select channel 2 (or whichever one you paired the second camera to) and you get that picture.  Simple!We also tried the Lorex Care app when we were out of the house and we had LTE or 3G or HSPA coverage and the app still worked great!  It seems to use about 300-500kbps to stream the picture.  Keep in mind for the whole internet access thing to work, the handheld monitor must be docked in the cradle.  One positive is we didn't have to muck around at all with our home wifi/ethernet router or firewall settings etc.  Things just worked. Love it!We are very happy with this Lorex so far and I will update later if our findings change.Update 4/10/2014Well as other reviewers pointed out, the battery life of the hand held monitor started dropping dramatically since we bought it 3 months ago.  Much more worrying, the battery started bulging out the back and it bulged so much it popped out the little battery door, screws and all.  Knowing this is a lithium battery this should not have happened as its supposed to have all kinds of overcharge and over current protections.  I suspect cheap/bad quality cells and it looks like a cheap no name battery.  Whatever it is, because of the bulging, I suspect this battery would have eventually exploded or leaked and caused a fire or damage; scary to think of \"what ifs\" when using this expensive little disaster around babies.  It's sitting safely in the garage now while I debate how to deal with Lorex and their atrocious customer service as detailed by many others here...

Does everything I was looking for - split screen video (so I can see multiple cameras at once and I don't have to leave it on that annoying option where monitors cycle through the cameras), pan/tilt/zoom cameras, two way microphone. It was a bonus for me that it also has a sleep sound machine option and that it comes with a free app so I can view the feed from my phone. I use this feature more than I expected - definitely worth the extra $ to get the wifi version!

I have no idea what would make this sort of thing happen.  I was using this monitor for my dogs at night because they sleep in a room on the other side of the house (I'm allergic to dogs so at the very least we can't have them in our bedroom) - one of them has epilepsy and this monitor was to see if he was having seizures at night.  We have single level house, so this monitor has to travel about 40-45 ft and go through 2 walls that are pretty well insulated.  For the first couple weeks, all was well, the video quality is quite good, the sound isn't as great but it was workable.  Then one night the monitor kept showing out of range... it hasn't worked for us since.  If I'm *right* outside the dog's room it works, but that's not what I need it for.  All other functions for this monitor are nice, but the range issue is a big problem.", "Date": "October 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lot's of Features, Near Perfect", "Author": "NyReckDiver", "ReviewID": "R2HM9M8M6A5N3X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "At this price point, I was not expecting much frankly.  Instead, I was pleasantly surprised.  It turned out to be a very affordable and agile system provided you stay within my tested range of 100 linear feet, providing there is no radio interference.  Homes with lots of walls and wiring within those walls will likely have reduced coverage.  This product will likely work best in open floor plans.The kit includes everything you need to establish a monitoring system.  The kit comes packaged well.  Build quality is more than sufficient for the purpose in my opinion.  Setup is very easy since it does not require use of your home wireless network.  Instead, it establishes a direct connection.  Total time before I was up and running?  About 10 minutes.Do not expect high definition monitoring. However, resolution was more than adequate to monitor activity in a room.  Camera viewing angle is also sufficient for monitoring a given space, though not exceptional and you will have to thoughtfully place the transmitter (camera) unit.  There is a landscape mode, which helps with the situation but really does not resolve it and this limited viewing angle may be a deal breaker for some people with the intention of monitoring an entire room or large play area.  The signal strength was more than adequate given our \"unopen\" floor plan.Lorex provide other features such as soothing sound effects, temperature sensor, and a remote controlled night-light, and an intercom.  While the sound effects were a nice touch, the intercom was not able to allow us to distinguish voices clearly and will not substitute for a walkie talkie.  Lorex also made the system expandable to 4 cameras and provides a decent rechargeable battery that lasted 5 hours during our use. I should mention that the night vision on the camera was remarkably adequate at this price point and in my opinion you would need to jump another $100 to do any better in this area.In short, I think many people will find this unit generally suitable. One note however, I found no method of being able to record audio/video, even with the A/V out jack.  I prefer units with memory onboard.", "Date": "September 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolute favorite monitor I've tried!", "Author": "A. Drewes \"Closet of Free Samples\"", "ReviewID": "R4GQUOP3JT22", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm just about 6 months along in this pregnancy. I'm not fully there, but I'm almost there. I'm now a stay at home mom plus I'm homeschooling our 5 year old, which is rewarding, but challenging at the same time. Why? Well she's a typical five year old who doesn't always want to listen or do her work. When I tell her to do something when she doesn't feel like it I often find her doing something else and conveniently \"forgetting\" that she was supposed to do it. If you ask her if she forgot because she doesn't feel like it she'll admit that it's true. At least she's honest. Of course this is frustrating. So my solution to make sure she's doing what she's supposed to and when? The Care N Share Wi-Fi Connected Video Baby Monitor from Lorex. I mean she even will constantly get out of bed to go \"potty\" just as an excuse to be out of bed rather than a need to go when she's really cutting up. So we figured this would be a great solution to the problem.When our monitor arrived from Lorex my husband and I were thrilled. First of all it is a stylish monitor and second of all it is VERY functional.

This thing has become a life saver! First of all it's easy to place in a room comes with a mount in case you want to place it on the ceiling or wall; wherever you choose. The monitor itself is almost like a mini iPad tabled or something with it's design. It took only a matter of minutes to set up and required little attention to the instructions for me. My husband used the instructions only to learn how we could monitor Sophia from our phones. Yes, you can watch your camera from your phone with their free app!Sophia likes the camera because she will look in it and talk to us and the best part is we can hear her crystal clear and she can hear us when we push the little bubble icon that's on the monitor so our voices come through to her on the camera in her room. Also, from the monitor I can play soothing sounds into her room - which is more appropriate for infants, but she find the monkey sounds amusing. I love how I can adjust the volume on both her camera and our monitor and that we can add up to 4 cameras total on this one monitor! Not to mention the monitor is portable so it can be carried from various rooms in the house for convenience as well. Did I mention you can even keep watch of the room temperature?! It shows directly on your monitor!Another cool feature of this baby monitor is that I can control the angle of the camera right from my monitor. It's a tiny little joy stick that I can maneuver from left to right or up and down which catches the majority of Sophia's room for us to watch her. I can keep up with what movie she's watching and make sure she's doing her work. When trying it out we even caught her in the act of climbing from her toy box to the to of her stool in a climbing manner that's generally not safe - and she knows better. We also watched as she would climb out of bed and she actually went up to the camera and said \"can I go to the bathroom?\" before exiting her room. She knows she's being watched and it has definitely improved her at least listening better.Needless to say I think I found one of the best, if not the best, monitor on the market. It's great for babies, young children, or just to have some sort of surveillance around the house for whatever reason. It's a high quality product that works great. We've been using ours for a few days now and I'm just in love with it. I love the fact of being able to record video and capture pictures from it. I love being able to hear what's going on and see what's going on. It's an excellent system that I would highly recommend to anyone for whatever the reason they may need it! It's fully up on technology and is a \"must have\" on my list!READ FULL REVIEW & PHOTOS HERE: [...]", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solidly constructed and for the price this has all the extra features I can imagine!!", "Author": "Momma Mary \"Expert Mom!\"", "ReviewID": "R2N276BIHVA9KS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not only does this have great picture quality (even in the Black & white night mode)they are both crisp and clear, very impressive and you can even zoom in (*it also displays the room temp!)and with the \"Two-Way Talk\" feature I can speak directly through the monitor's built-in  mic.! This is perfect for Gramma (aka me!! LOL) as I worry more now that my hearing (and eyesight) isn't as good as it was when my kids were babies.Another cool feature that I use to create \"background sound\" to prevent a rude awakening due to a phone ringing etc is the \"Sleep & Soothe Sound\" feature which has 5 background sounds from nature (the beach waves and rainfall are my faves) to help lull them to sleep.My goodness, I can even add a \"Lorex Baby Wi-Fi Cradle\" (*this is bought separately) it is an accessory will transmit your camera's video feed online so you can also connect with a pc, smart phone, tablet etc and even take pictures and save on my devices (you'll need a microSD card for that but they are cheap these days, if you don't already have an extra one), you can also expand the view to 4 rooms at a time if you need that by buying extra cameras! I only need the one right now but I can see when they are getting into the toddler stage where this may be needed to keep an eye on them in all rooms that are open to them (I have an open floor plan)I can also switch to a \"power save\" mode (It turns off screen and keeps mic on to hear your child's breathing sounds so you can monitor how deep they are sleeping w/out keeping the picture turned on!)I like that as if I am quick I can get back in there and rock the bassinet gently to get them back to sleep or turn them on their other side. I like the night light it emits, I find it just right for my older eyes.There are loads of other features you can play with but these are the main ones that I am over the moon about!Oh, forgot to mention the battery will last me all night (the book says up to 8 hours and I think that is pretty close from my experience, but I usually switch it off video to sound only when I go to bed) although I usually just leave it attached as I don't move it around often. If you keep it on video all night I would just be sure to keep it (the usb charger) plugged into the monitor to be safe.FYI, It also feels nice and solidly made, not a lightweight cheap build like most things these days, it feels like it will last through many grandbabies (if I'm that blessed!) ;-)", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "AWESOME", "Author": "KW", "ReviewID": "R1BPSZESR3VW66", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Does everything it says it does.
