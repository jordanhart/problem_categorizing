This is the only 808 style camera that is marked \"Ships from and sold by Amazon.\"  With that in mind, I decided there must a $27 reason for that, over the $10.99 cost of the other similar products.Most of the other reviews focused on problems dealing with documentation, manufacturing quality and support.* Documentation is excellent.  In clear and concise ENGLISH.* Manufacturing quality, no complaints.* Support, non needed.The only discrepancy in the documentation refers to red, green, yellow and blinking red/green lights.  The device contains a red and a green LED, whose lights are indirectly visible through a hole in the case.  The color \"yellow\" is really referring to the mixed light reflection you see when both LEDs are shining through the hole.  When the documentation refers to blinking red/green lights, they mean that because the red LED is stronger than the green one, the green will stay on and the red one will actually do the blinking.P.S. when passed through a courthouse or airport fluoroscope, the image given off is non-suspicious.
