I researched at least four similar devices (including Ideal's $700+ unit) before choosing this one, and I am not at all disappointed.The first impression I had upon pulling it out of the box was the build quality. Despite being an import, this is a surprisingly rugged device with a first-class keypad. The display is bright and clear, easily visible in open daylight, and having multimeter plus PTZ test functions in one unit is extremely handy when you're 10 feet up on a ladder, poking around inside a camera's guts.My one and ONLY gripe so far is the multimeter test leads. They're definitely not up to the same standard as the instrument itself, being PVC insulated as opposed to the higher-quality silicone rubber found on better sets.I would not hesitate to recommend this unit to anyone working in the CCTV arena.", "Date": "October 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "A must if you install cams", "Author": "FP Crazy", "ReviewID": "R1F87G0Q37A973", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Other companies put their name on this and sell it for a lot more.
