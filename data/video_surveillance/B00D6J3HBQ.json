I think the previous reviewers really missed out on a great opportunity!  How sad!This is the first consumer grade security unit that I have worked with that works perfectly networking wise!  Yes, the manuals are a bit short on router setup for the novice user.  Truth is, once port forwarding is setup for RTSP and HTTP Ports, about 10 minutes work, this unit works perfectly!  Very simple and straight forward setup!  What was wrong for the other reviewers???Works very well even with other DDNS Services besides Samsung's own iPolis service.  I am using an ASUS router and their own free www.asuscomm.com DDNS service for example.  Lorex and Swann should be terribly ashamed.Very impressive setup Samsung!  Wide angle cameras!  Great night vision, about 50 feet!  Great camera brightness, contrast and color control and adjustment!  Easy menu control [ using a mouse ] - good security!  Great overall performance!WOW!  At long last - 'audio' is available on the iPhone and iPad viewer [ using other cameras of course ] with the iPolis Mobile application.  10 Stars!  Note: The supplied cameras don't have audio!  If only these cameras had audio / microphones - even just half of them - this package would be perfect!We can now use the iPad / iPhone / iPolis Mobile viewer 'with audio' when setting out back, in the shop, office, remote location, using WiFi around the house / DDNS while traveling - to 'hear and see' the selected / Favorite camera!  Absolutely perfect Puppy and Baby Camera(s)!!!Also, the HDMI and VGA outputs can be used simultaneously.  Watch out for the display resolution limitations!  It is really nice to have a local monitor and a distant monitor attached simultaneously!  I am using a Cat-5 HDMI Tx/Rx Hub for a distant display.The DVR is not controllable/programmable from Safari using the Silverlight garbage!  Latest update breaks the Viewer!  So typical of Microsoft!  So ... for Apple OS-X / Safari - browser viewer only when/if Silverlight plugin works!  Don't do Updates!  If it is not broken - leave it alone!My only disappointment is that the email event sending cannot be controlled / throttled during nighttime hours.  When using outside camera installations the email event triggers will drive you crazy!  This system needs an event scheduler for email notifications!!!!  Daytime events are perfect!  Again, Lorex and Swann should be terribly ashamed.Finally, what is wrong with all of these security people???  Meaning, how hard could it be to provide commonly readable event backups of recorded events?  Samsung at least does a good job with their SEC package with a player embedded in the recording backup / archive.  Windows only!!!!  Desperately needs an Apple player - or - please - record the output in a usable format!Q-See - not worth mentioning!Lorex is useless!  Expensive!  Over heats!  Terrible cameras!  A terrible non-working networking experience!  Zero Support!  [ Notice how all the Costco display units are dead?  There is a good hint!  ]Swann - only 50% there!  Useless interface!  Useless/Non-existent Support!Samsung - Support? - I have no idea - it just works!Great Costco Price!  Great overall product performance - 98% there feature wise!", "Date": "October 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hard to not like a Samsung product ...but I don't  like this one", "Author": "Wayne H. Law \"Wayne\"", "ReviewID": "RA6AUNS1J4PIA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Sadly the installation of these Samsung security camera systems is the worst I have seen of any of the Samsung products that I own (and love).  Compared to my Note II, SmartTV and my Blue Ray player this let me down.  Mind you the quality of the system itself looks GREAT.  But my son and I (both quite technically savy) could never get this to work over the internet.  The entire reason I got it was so that my smartphone (Note II) could show me what is happening at my home.  Also you only get 60 ft of cable and while you can purchase longer extensions in most cases you will need several to reach all 10 cameras.  I have a relatively small home and still see where I will need 5 of the 100 ft extensions.We even had Costco service people on the phone for 2 hours and they finally blamed it on the Internet provider yet everything else in my home works fine off it (including my Omma voip phone). Sadly returned the system to Costco (purchase price there was $699).", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Value for the price", "Author": "Chris R.", "ReviewID": "R3C794K1LB9GQ8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Had the system about a week now.  Does everything it says it does and phyical instalation was a breeze.  Getting everything working over the internet is another story.  I am fairly computer savvy, but I could not get it talking to either my computer OR my smart phone.  The hardopy manuel for this is just about as bad as bad gets.  They include a CD with a PDF of the full version, but it is still lacking when it comes to explaining some of the features.  Purcahsed the unit from Costco and they encourage you to use their conceair service for techinical problems.  I did and the gentelman I talked with was VERY nice, but after an hour and a half on the phone, I was no further along then I was by myself.  So I figured I would call Samsung technical support before I took it back.......ten minutes after they anwsered, EVERYTHING was working perfectly.  I am very satisfied.  The picture is ok...would like a little more, but you start getting into alot more money to get perfectly clear resolution.  The only other thing is that I wish there was some way to have off site storage of the data, real time.  Over all, very good value for the money!", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "prelim review", "Author": "Webfoot", "ReviewID": "R386MV9DXLKPEA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Like others, saw this system along with the Lorex system at Costco.  Seen these systems at 3 different stores and at all 3, the display images on the Samsung looked a lot nicer.  The brand name was enough to encourage me to buy and test it out at home.At home the pic qlty isn't any better than the Lorex.  No problem setting up the system for a trial run.  Real decent user interface but has a lot less capabilities than the Lorex.  No capabilities for an ext alarm.  Had a recent break-in at the house.  Deputy that responded said if we get some kind of security system, make sure it has a loud alarm.  Nothing like an alarm that the bad guys can hear to encourage them to leave QUICKLY.  For me, want the alarm away from the DVR, don't want anything to say, here I am.As mentioned was a little disappointed in video qlty.  With 2 cameras hooked up and both set the same for brightness and contrast, images didn't look the same even though both were next to each other and point to same spot.  Also noted on one of the cameras I tried, ~6 of the IR LEDs were not working.Do like the cameras and the metal ball & socket mount.  Oh, be aware the cameras come with a small clear film protector covering the camera lens.  Make sure you remove them.When comparing these 2 systems, the good from the not so good, this system didn't come out on top for the things I deem important.  Will be returning this system.  Don't know what it is saying or if it is important but the mfg date on this system says it was made ~9 months ago.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great option for a small biz", "Author": "David Lopez M", "ReviewID": "R3M9S9GTWUT8ID", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is a great option for an small business indoors.
