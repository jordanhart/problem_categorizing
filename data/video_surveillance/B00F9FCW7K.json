I like the cloud recording as local storage doesn't make sense if you have a burglar who could easily steal/break the camera. Could the cost of the cloud recording be lower? Sure. But that will require a competitor to come up with a better product at a lower cost. Could happen.

It will detect minimal shadow casts through windows. Mine seemingly sends alerts without any movement of anything, light included. I had to turn this feature off because I would get constant alerts, you can't trust it. I have a Piper as well and it has a much better motion detector, the downside to the Piper camera is that the lens is infrared so it cannot detect motion through windows. So if you want to point it outside it will not detect motion, even if you wave your hands directly into the camera. I thought Dropcam would cure this deficit but it fails for the opposite reason, it's too damn sensitive! I have read many reviews and forums and its a constant complaint, but I do not see the Dropcam heads responding to this concern. It's a major flaw for those looking for a security camera. Do not buy this if you need motion detection alerts.The fee for cloud service sucks, I don't know who would pay for for 24 hour cloud service. If I wanted to spend that kind of money I would just hire ADP to fit my house with their over priced service. In a world where we as consumers are getting nickel and dimed for everything, the last thing I want to sign up for is more cloud service, at least not at those prices.One of these companies has to get this niche market right, Dropcam came close but falls short like the others. Piper comes close as well, but the video quality is not as good as Dropcam.

It has certainly given me peace of mind. I am not a subscriber of the monthly recording plan, as I believe it is too expensive for my purposes. Furthermore, I have paired my Dropcam with SmartThings. SmartThings recently provided integration into their platform with Dropcam to allow the capturing of images on the detection of motion or when sensors open and close. This integration is where I derive most of the value from the device, because I choose not to purchase a monthly plan from Dropcam. The image quality is pretty great for a webcam, but the device tends to be a bandwidth hog, so I choose to use the location features within the smartphone app to automatically turn the device off while I am at home (which doesn't work correctly very often and then requires manually opening the app and turning it off). If you are concerned with going over your monthly allowance with your internet service provider, this may not be the device for you (particularly if you need more than 1 device).I made the device 4 stars mainly because I believe the smartphone app can be significantly improved. The web interface allows you to zoom in and \"enhance\" video; however, the app does not. Therefore, if you have zoomed in on the web interface and forget to zoom back out before you log out, then in the app you are forced to view only that zoomed in portion of the recording until you zoom out on the web app. This can become increasingly frustrating as it has happened to me several times.", "Date": "May 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dropcam Pro..again.", "Author": "MPG", "ReviewID": "R2TRHAI67T9W0O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The easy setup and use (with user friendly interface) on my first Dropcam Pro has caused me to return the Samsung Smartcam HD and order another Dropcam Pro.

Their app to retrieve them is painfully slow and what I've found disappointingly is that on a regular basis the cameras either disconnect (and don't reconnect) or suffer some type of \"burp\" (yes, that's a technical term) when uploading their images to the provider.  On top of this the alarm co decided to design the clip to be 10 seconds after an event, so unless your Mr. Burglar is a charmer and when he trips the alarm is nice enough to stare steadily into the camera for a selfie your opportunity on getting a good pic is very limited.Not so with Dropcam.  Superb setup, easy user interface, very reliable and dependable.  I've had no disconnects that I can ascertain and when my internet service went down and came back up a few minutes later the camera cleanly reconnected.  My usage is limited to about 4 days to date but the image quality is spectacular, the wide angle lens really is great and the night vision is fine.  I don't have a problem paying $15/mo to get 7 days versus up video storage because I get 7 full days of storage and can go back and forth through a time span to watch an event (I just watched FedEx deliver to my house... and I'm at the office!  Apparently they delivered about 30 minutes ago and I was able to quite easily scroll through the timeline to find when the driver was on my porch).To help me from a security standpoint I connected an older Dell 9\" Android Tablet up to the wall above my intercom and I run the dropcam app 24/7.

I tend not to be a returner and I was feeling badly about returning a Vuepro Camera that I'd bought from amazon (don't buy the Vuepro) and I didn't want to risk buying the dropcam and returning it too. It's my nature to not be wasteful. Anyhoo, I brought the dopcam pro home and had it set up in my den in under fifteen minutes. The picture quality is great, I'm not getting any of the freezing that some have complained about and the hesitation in audio is very slight. I'm going to buy at least one more dropcam pro and get the cloud service for both. The service for a week's worth of recording to the cloud is $99. for one camera and for a second camera it's half price, so once you've bought two of these cameras for $400., cloud service is $150. a year for both cameras. You can't beat that!Listen: I set the camera up in my den not far from my African Grey Parrot's cage and went in to my office on the other side of the house to see how things looked. Clear as a bell.

The image quality is excellent, even in low light conditions, and it maintains its wireless connection continually and completely reliably.  The cloud video recording (\"CVR\") is exceptionally convenient (we have the 7-day storage plan); and both the CVR and the Dropcam image can be accessed remotely, as can be the camera's settings & controls.  The camera's built-in microphone's sensativity can be adjusted, and I have found the quality of the recorded sounds to be quite good as well, just as the camera's image is.  One can also set the camera to send alerts to an email address should it detect sound, motion or any other unrecognized activity.  It is a snap to set up and takes literally only a minute or two to set up and to have it up and running.  The camera does *not* require any ongoing connections to a computer (a computer is only reqired for the intitial setup, and then is not required after that).  Furthermore, in my view, not having to keep a computer up and running to use the camera or to capture video locally is a huge advantage.  For example, one could live in the northeast, yet maintain a camera remotely installed at another location, say, in Florida.  Not needing to maintain a connection to a computer to use the Dropcam eliminates any concerns about potential power failures & the related computer reboots, etc. at the [remote] camera's location.

I set the Belkin up in my kitchen to view anyone coming in the door and the DropCam upstairs to keep an eye on the dogs.First issue with this Belkin. I literally get over FIFTY motion detection emails a day, at that is a low estimage. There is NO ONE in my house and no movement shown on the tiny screenshots sent to my email. Secondly, there is no notification from the app. So if I have the email settings on my phone turned off, I do not get an alert with sound, which considering the number of false alarms, is probably a good thing. Then the email itself, just shows a screenshot of the (non-motion) versus a live feed (more on that in a second). Using the app, to view any clips that may have been taken if there was actual movement requires a subscription to Belink for their cloud service, which I don't think I really need at this point. My last issue is that for some reason the view on my phone shows on the display vertically so I have to turn my phone to view the screen correctly, which is really just an annoyance.Had I not also purchased the DropCam Pro, most of these things might not bother me as much. But with that, the downloaded app alerts me to real movement, so I can actually go into the camera app and view a live feed or any activities that may have recently happened if I missed them (with pretty good sound). You can purchase the cloud also, but I just want to make sure things are good with my dogs here and there, not really storing any data long term. I also get an email with the same thing, but the link through the app is perfect. I don't get any false alarms and the picture/sound I find much better. The only downside to this device, is that you do need a computer/laptop at this point to do the initial set-up, but like the Belkin it was pretty easy.I am not a tech/gadet person and I really wanted to like the less expensive product.

Eventually, I'll install it as a security device. The reason for only 4 stars is when my wife and I freaked out once. Here is what happened:One evening, we put our baby down upstairs (while he was tired but mostly awake) and then my wife and I came downstairs. We setup our iPhone to view the baby in real-time with sound. We could hear the baby making some minor noise here and there while we were watching TV. Then, after few minutes, my wife took a closer look to see if he is asleep since it was quiet. And what she saw scared the hell out of us. We can clearly see the babies' eyes are open, staring almost at the camera, but NOT MOVING one bit. We turned up the sound, kept watching for another 20 seconds. ABSOLUTELY no sound (but we know the mic is on since we hear the slight hiss), and NO movement while he's looking at the camera with his eyes open. Yeah, you can imagine our reaction. I ran like hell up the stairs, stormed into his room and immediately picked him up. His eyes were closed and clearly he was asleep. I woke him a bit just to make sure. Then, I slowly put him down again and went downstairs. My wife was watching the camera the whole time still frozen with the baby's eyes open. We immediately knew that although sound was live the picture clearly froze. I had to turn the camera on and off again few times to make work again properly.So, it definitely left a scar in our memory. It's because of the \"live\" hiss sound, we just thought camera is recording live. Anyway, I have over 50megs down and 10 up.

I solved that problem for a temporary fix by buying a portable battery that you use to charge ipads, iphones or any USB chargeable device. I purchased a Anker\u00ae Astro E5 15000mAh Dual USB Portable Charger from Amazon that works really great and lasts a long time powering the camera on a full charge. The charge operated the cam for exactly 27 hours and 48 minutes.  Not bad for a charge but I realize also you might want the cam to operate for longer than a day. I guess outside of running electric to the cam you could have 2 or more batteries charged and interchange them out when it is depleted.  I know it's not ideal but it works and works great.

I had two primary reasons; determine which of my dogs was destroying everything every time we left the house, and for babysitter monitoring in the near future.Well we had the perfect chance to test it out yesterday. After having been gone from home for about 30 minutes, we checked the camera to see the \"planted\" newspaper strewn about the room. We backed up to the previous activity markers (there are markers to show when there was activity you would want to view) to see our one dog destroying the paper while the other one growled and barked at him from the couch the entire time. We're pretty sure she was trying to tell him to stop because she never growls and barks at him unless he's trying to stand on her, and he was no where near her. It was fantastic because we knew not to scold her when we got home since she had nothing to do with it.The quality is great, but it does get a little grainy when you zoom in. No big deal though, how close do you need to get? It picks up sound really well; we could even hear her low growls before she picked up her head and she was all the way on the other side of the room from where the camera was placed. The night vision works really well too. I've checked in on the living room from my bedroom once to check on a noise (so much safer than walking out there if there were to be a burglar or something!) and everything was crystal clear, just black and white.It's also awesome that you can talk to whoever you're watching. I logged into the phone app (which is free) the other night and was talking to the dogs. One of them got up and started licking and sniffing the camera (and it didn't leave any gross smudges blocking my view).The ONLY thing I don't like, is that the CRV (recording, saving, and watching previous footage feature) is only available if you pay. It's a little expensive; $10 a month or $99 a year for 7 days of saved, or $30 a month or $300 a year for 30 days of saved.I'd really like to get the CVR option, which we have a free trial of right now, because it's a big part of the usefulness of this product, but that's just a little expensive.

Out of the box It took about 10 minutes to have up and streaming. Super easy. The power cord is pretty long which I appreciate. We put the camera near the ceiling and there was still some slack. It will have to be stapled to the baseboard to keep it from dangling. The setup is minimal, username, password, find wifi, that's it. The picture quality is pretty good. It isn't sharp/clear like digital video camera recording. But, it is a pretty good streaming quality. It adjusts the lighting making up for dim rooms. Looks brighter/lighter in the stream.  The only real negative for me is the zoom. The zoom isn't like a real zoom. You zoom in a digital zoom way...like when zooming in on a picture on your digital camera. So, it shows the pixels after about 4x. But you can get to 8x and get an idea of what is going on in less detail.  Hopefully if the wifi is better it will get clearer. For what I need with my baby, it is perfect. It can view the whole room. We may mount it to the wall directly about the crib so that the crib can be the focal point and less of the surroundings take up space. So far I have had a 3-4 second delay which I don't think is too bad. It definitely isn't \"live\" live.  Although, I noticed that on my laptop the delay is slightly less than on my iPad app. I get alerts on my phone when there is movement or noise. A little clip is included in the email alert so you can view what just happened. I suppose you need the cvr plan to get the clips. I'm still in the 14 day free trial. Otherwise, the emails direct you to view live which is free. The cvr recording option isn't a real problem for us. Regular baby monitors don't have the option to record so the fact that I have to pay a bit doesn't bother me. Of course free would be great but the fee is ok. We can create and share clips which is pretty cool. The talk feature is ok. But, it's like talking through a walkie talkie.  You can't both talk at the same time if one parent is in the room and the other is somewhere else streaming. But, it works.  If I talk to my baby through that it won't matter.  I really like it so far. My husband can view the baby and talk to him from work during the day.

Read update at the end of this review.I started using Dropcam in September after a theft at my restaurant, Dale's Caf\u00e9. Tried one and then quickly added two more after I saw the ease of use and ease of installation and after I tried a Foscam which was tedious to install and did not include a built in monitor which their ad claimed is included. Three Dropcams had me protected from any more thefts, but in a few weeks I wanted two more in order to monitor my dining areas. Well, lo and behold a surprise package came with a Dropcam Pro inside. It was a gift from Dropcam because I had given them a good review on the first three and also shared with them a design I came up with for a very secure mounting plate which is necessary in a busy environment like our restaurant. I then purchased a second Dropcam Pro and just finished installation of both cameras today. I apologize to Dropcam that it's taken me a couple of months since I first received their gift until today's install, but I promised them I would give a review and I can feel like it's unbiased because it's finished on my timetable according to the needs of my business.The Dropcam Pro has every feature of a regular Dropcam and it has better definition and a wider view. This is good for my situation because the Pros are covering a larger area in the dining rooms and the regular Dropcams are in a closer range because the kitchen areas are smaller.  My large dining area is 23' by 25' and my large kitchen is 12' by 18'. I am very satisfied with the visual quality on all my cameras and they perform better than I need them to.  I don't use the audio on any of my cameras but I did with my first Dropcam and it worked great. Then I found out that it is possibly illegal to record audio in public places so I shut off audio on all my cameras.The main reason I like Dropcam and Dropcam Pro is the way they record on Dropcam's website (they call it a cloud). I use their seven day recording cycle and for five cameras it costs me thirty dollars a month. A thief can come in and grab my cameras but he can't steal the recording of his theft. If I had a camera system on a DVR and a thief stole it I would lose the entire recording but with Dropcam I have the security of knowing I have a recording of the thief up to the moment he takes my camera. Accessing my cameras on Dropcam's website is as easy as accessing my email or checking my bank account. I can access my cameras anywhere there is internet access.The only possible downside of using Dropcam versus an in house system is the need for wireless internet access and the monthly cost if you need storage of your recordings. But for my purpose of securing my business I think it's money well spent. If you want to monitor a place where there is no internet access you are SOL, or to be less cryptic it just won't work. For my setup with five cameras I my internet provider gives me 10 mbps of download and 2mpbs of upload. Dropcam's technician recommends 0.5 mbps of upload per camera if you use audio (the cameras don't use download). But because I don't use audio the 2 mbps of upload is more than enough for five cameras. I tested my connection with all cameras on and was still showing 1.29 mbps of upload available which indicates I could probably add five more cameras and still have plenty of bandwidth to support them.I said it in my first review and still feel the same way, Dropcam's system of recording on their internet site is superior to in-house recording and I believe they lead the future of the video surveillance industry. They also have a great support staff and I haven't been left on hold for more than a couple of minutes.If you email any questions to me I will respond but I don't use email on a daily basis so it may take some time.Update 01-08-14 Having used all five cameras for 6 days I've experienced some intermittent down time occasionally on individual cameras and spoke with Dropcam support. They want me to increase my upload bandwidth to a minimum of 0.5 mpbs per camera which means I will need 2.5 mpbs upload for my five cameras. This increase takes place today and I will report back with results.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Outstanding", "Author": "MJC", "ReviewID": "RBCXCG7P9ABZQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A friend recommended this camera; I read the reviews, including the concerns, but thought I'd give it a try.

One of those dummies they call \"early adopters\" so I've ended up spending money on a lot of products that never quite live up to the hype. Security cameras are one of those items. Over the last two years, I've spent $400 to $500 on security camera gear that would (1) Allow me to view my home in real time from anywhere in the world (2) Alert me via text or email if there was motion or abnormal sound in the house and (3) Document in video or photos what caused the alert and to automatically \"push\" the collected data into an off-site storage area. The other devices that I purchased would not do all of those things but I accepted the compromises that I had to make. Unfortunately, reliability was also an issue with the other products.Two weeks ago I read a couple of reviews on the new Dropcam Pro and it seemed like a dream come true. I ordered one from Amazon and received it today. As advertised, I had it up and running in 5 minutes after I downloaded the iPhone app. No need to fiddle with router settings, firewalls or anything. The video is excellent even in my dimly lit living room. The wide-angle view is perfect and the zoom works well. Motion/Sound detection works well. There are many other features that can be turned on and off so I recommend that you go to the manufacturer's web site and check them out. I played with all of them today and they all work as well as their claims. The unit comes with a free 14 day trial period for the feature that stores 7 days of video on the companies cloud server. Very cool. You can go there from the phone app or from any web browser and scroll back through the history. Any disturbances due to sound or motion show up on the time line as \"blips\" so that you can go directly to those parts of the video. From there, you can set a start and end point and save the video/audio clip. Once done, you can even download it.The Dropcam folks charge $99 per year for this cloud service but that seems like a bargain for this kind of peace of mind. We live in a rural area and there have been lots of break-ins the last couple of years. My wife and I have been traveling a lot since we retired five years ago. I had a basic ADT system installed but by the time law enforcement could respond, my \"stuff\" would be long gone. This camera would at least give us some evidence to help the police catch the thieves and maybe even recover our belongings.Further details are on the manufacturer's web site.

I was very pleased with the previous model, but had one spot where I could really take advantage of the new wider angle lens. I can say there are three situations where this cam really makes a difference over the previous model:-Places where you need a wider angle of viewingThe increase is not dramatic, but enough to cover a full area side to side better than the previous model.-Places where you need a finer color detail for differentiationThe Pro can differentiate more finely reds, grays and other colors.-Cams that are facing out windows and showing outdoor scenes.The color difference in showing outdoor scenes is significant. It went from a bit gray, to vibrant and dynamic.Setup of the cams is not difficult, and is the same as previous models.

Its been a really cool experience to use and have had lots of fun with it to. Setup was fast, its dead simple to use, you can share your feed with other people (and revoke access) easily. The app for the iPhone is great, letting you remotely turn the camera on or off, zoom and record.I'm taking one star off because they only give you one month of their CVR service which does two things. First, it backs up all your video for I think the next seven days. Second, and cooler I think, is that when it notices movement it grabs that time and gives you an alert and you can easily view all the times there was movement during the day (so you don't have to watch it all the time).For a premium product and the more expensive model, I would have hoped it would be included or at least 3-6 months of free service.", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "robert engle", "ReviewID": "RW8GQ6QUSDK9M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera, wish it could be used outside I use it in the window and it's  a great  view in the day.", "Date": "June 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "DH", "ReviewID": "R20FYUGABGZZG0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We are using this as a home monitoring camera to keep an eye on things while at work.

As such, it's really important for it to work continuously and without fail. For the most part the Dropcam does well. Both the phone and website cut out occasionally but I've never seen it cut out for more than a minute except once, for 4 minutes (Walked in the room, saw it blinking like it lost wireless and after a minute it started working again. I suspect a firmware update went out). The cut-outs happen pretty often, maybe once every few hours and last about a minute generally. Also, the video in the web player tends to get quite a bit of a delay after a while of viewing, up to a minute behind even though it still says \"Live\".The camera is somewhat sensitive to wireless interference and distance from the router. If you have trouble you may have to invest in a powerline-networking or other option to put an extension closer to the camera.There are also some limitations to the camera that are worth nothing. It will not work without an internet connection. The way the service works is the camera sends the video to the Dropcam cloud and all receivers pull the video stream from there. It's really nice that the camera kind-of 'just works', but it would be nice to have an offline option. You don't have to pay for the online services to use the camera however you will get no video history if you don't pay. The pay service has some nice features such as easily creating timelapse videos or capturing video clips but I'm not sure if I'll pay for it yet. I don't know if you can capture anything without paying for the online service but I've read you can at least view the camera for no monthly fee.Also, the Dropcam will use your internet bandwidth all the time while you are paying for the cloud service and double that when you are watching video at home. It's not a lot, but it adds up through the month so if you're on the edge of using all your cable bandwidth, this might put you over. It's a little frustrating that the camera can't broadcast on the local network for viewing without having to go online.The wi-fi on the first Dropcam we ordered died and we had to return it, but the second worked perfectly so the first one was just a lemon. Dropcam support was as helpful as they could be, but it was still very frustrating for us.None of these issues are strong enough for us to return the Dropcam, however if you have a something critical you want to watch this might not be the best option for you. Overall I think it's a wonderful piece of technology but I can't help but feel a little let down. I really love the rugged-looking and compact design as well as the picture quality but it seems like it's just not quite there yet as far as reliability goes. It's also a little frustrating that the Dropcam company seems to be really pushing the online video service and failing at offering offline services for people who just want a simple high-quality web-cam.As an alternative, there is Piper. I only read about it for a few minutes just now after noticing we website mention it but it's supposed to be no monthly fee.

I am conflicted about the subscription pricing though. You have to get the subscription for the camera to be of much use. It costs $99 a year. Seems expensive for what it is... But then again it's less expensive than an alarm company.If you live in a busy city, police can take anywhere from 20 minutes to several hours to respond to your house when an alarm company calls in an activation. There are so many false activations from alarms that police consider them a lower priority. With this camera, it will send your phone a notification for unusual activity. If someone is actually in your house, you can call the police yourself and confirm it is a real crime in progress. Seems more efficient to me than dealing with an alarm co.I like that the iPhone app will turn the camera on and off automatically when I come or go. It makes it easy to not have to think about it, and less likely my home life will be caught on tape!I would feel better about the subscription cost if it included more than the one camera for all the same price.

I believe the minimum per camera is 0.5 mbps. and if you have 2 Dropcams, it's 1 mbps and so forth. But also keep in mind that if you have a computer, laptop, TV, cell phone that is using the WiFi in your home as well, that it will consume and share this bandwidth with the Dropcam.I say this because my Dropcam tends to lose connection here and there and it's because of the bandwidth. and yes, my router is in the same room and close to my camera. So please make note of your internet connection before buying. it will start to alert you though when your camera has low signal. The bandwidth will also affect your live viewing. The connection will not be able to keep up and you will start to see bits of the clips lagging. It can be frustrating when trying to watch the live feed.Overall, the quality of the physical components of the camera are great. (It also comes with a wall mount). There is a blue light that stays on when recording and if your camera loses signal, it will blink yellow (as it is trying to find wifi connection). There is a red blinking light and believe that it when it detects motion. The light though is subtle and not obnoxious to where it alarms intruders or anyone else that you have a camera.If you are set up for motion alerts, it has the ability to send you an email with a screencap of the detected motion. Although the timing kind of lags in the photo, I will usually get blank shots of my room once I've walked passed it. I've encountered a couple of times where it has been able to capture a person in the screengrab.The actually quality of the video itself is okay (not as superior as you would think). You can see some examples of the quality online at Dropcam's main website, where they have public live feeds. But I will admit, the quality is better than most cameras I've encountered. The night vision capabilities are great! So if anything happens at night, you are able to clearly see what's going on. I love the talk feature- it is crisp, clear, and loud (if need to be) when I speak into the mic from my phone, but the two way talk feature doesn't really work. So I can never really hear the other person unless if I shut off the mic. This might be due to the low bandwidth as well.Other than that, setup is super easy.

If you want to record you have to pay the cvr fee. However I am glad that it does not work like a conventional IP cam because they have atrocious security. It doesn't matter if you change the default ports and user id. Most of the competitors do not use a encrypted connection and are open to attack. Some have upnp turned on by default and will happily give the entire internet a window into your home. Some higher end cams do offer ssl at least for the login info but I'm still not sure if the actual video feed is encrypted. Even the popular Blue Iris software only recently added digest authentication which still isn't ssl.Eventually I would like to see the option to use third party software but the dropcam is secure and the apps are solid. For a comparison I was using the commercial software xprotect with a Hikvision DS-2CD2432F-IW. It was more like viewing snapshots than live viewing remotely and no audio support with that combo. Dropcam has it down to a science when optimizing your connection for remote viewing. While the always uploading can be a con for some it works out because multiple family members can view the same feed without draining your home connection.  If you want to record and view locally only then this isn't for you. I also want to mention that the hardware, software, electricity , and your maintenance time for local recording are far from free and underestimated by most people.As for some con's. The mobile app is missing a basic option that everyone else has. A screenshot button. While I'm ok with dropcam being locked to their service it needs more variety in cvr plans. I would like to see something for 1 - 3 days of recording even if it was only 20 bucks cheaper per year. If they ever break the minimum price point of $99 per year for service I would look else where.Over all I would say that IMHO the dropcam is probably the best option at the moment if you want something remotely accessible.", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Did not disappoint", "Author": "PJ", "ReviewID": "RRD2J0PHK0GEL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Moved to a new apartment.

The quality of the images is just O.K.; it may be better than a lot of what's out there but that shouldn't lead you to believe that you'll be satisfied with the video feed.  The image looks pretty good when you first log in, but any zooming at all immediately pixelates the image to near-uselessness.  We have a stellar network speed and top of the line airport base station; there's no shortcoming on that front.Where this camera really shines is its ease of setup, automatic updating, and accessibility from a lot of devices.  I found the motion and sound alerts to be prompt and useful.  The app is easy to use and free.  It also does a great job detecting sound and motion, but you're access to these features is really hampered by the cost of subscribing to their CVR (continuous video recording) service.  In my opinion, the absence of a memory card slot is not an oversight by Dropcam, its a business decision aimed at inducing you to subscribe to a costly service.The bottom line: If you absolutely need to buy a camera, this might be the best of what's out there right now.

You can do live viewing or look at your activity feed from the apps.You can change your cameras setting from the apps.You CANNOT make clips,view saved clips or download saved clips from either app.You will need a pc or laptop to make clips,view saved clips or download saved clips.* I love the versatility of this camera.I can move it anywhere within my home as my needs change.I can use it to look out my various windows.I can watch my pets if I desire.* I love the cloud recording options.I am not tech savy enough,rich enough and I don't have the time to set up my own recording system.I chose the 7 day 9.99 option.I mistakenly thought I had to pre pay for a year.I can afford 10.00 bucks a month and I can cancel or upgrade at anytime.Plus I love that the recording is held off site.If someone steals my camera they can't steal the video!* I have cable wifi so my connection is pretty quick.I have had zero connection issues.* I often use this camera at night through a glass paned window.I shut off the cameras night time light.The area I am recording (my front porch and lawn) is well lit.The camera captures the area very well.I have also moved this camera to a bathroom window and pointed through a hole I made in the screen (on a dry night)I wanted to watch my car which was parked on a street about 50 feet away. Again the camera night time light was turned off and the area is also well lit.I can see the car very well.I would not be able to make out the face of someone bothering my car but I can see if anyone goes near it.* I called their customer service hotline with a question about making clips.Their rep answered the phone quickly,was friendly and very informative.Overall,I am so happy with this camera and the recording options.

There is a slight curve to the image but nothing at all that is so noticeable that you won't get used to it. Night vision is excellent. Did not buy the yearly subscription so I cannot comment on the 30-day play back, but the Zoom-Wand works great so if you need to zoom in on something, you hit the wand and quality goes back to nearly as good as zoomed all the way out. Sound quality is pretty clear as well. I had to turn off the alerts because it alerted my phone almost EVERYTIME our baby's balloon on his crib moved but that can be said as a good thing in that the motion detection on it is great if you have a sleeping baby and want to know when they wake up. I also love the fact that you can set an on-and-off timer on the camera so that for those stretches of time when, say, your baby is at daycare, it automatically turns off from whatever time and day you set it to when you need it.

Resets didn't always work and because of this inconsistency, I had to return it.  I may have had a defective unit judging by the positive reviews I've read.I ended up getting a refund instead of an exchange for a few reasons.  The biggest one is the fact that it is constantly uploading video to the cloud; not just during motion or sound. This was slowing my connection speed for other devices and thankfully I don't have a cap on my data.  My other problem is the inability to capture video locally.  I know Dropcam would like to make a buck off their cloud service, which certainly has it's uses, but the average consumer should be given options depending on what they're using the camera for.  If I wanted to use it for a presentation, I wouldn't be able to simply use video capture software and dump the video file into an editor.  I'd have to first go online, edit the clip, download it, then dump into my editor.  Some people won't have any problem with this but I was surprised that the camera can't simply be used as a standard webcam.The local webcam functionality would be great for this camera as it has a very attractive cosmetic design and looks professional for business meetings while providing really fantastic video quality.

It's more expensive than other webcams, but overall I'm pleased with it. I normally don't write reviews, but this one was worth it. I love the ability to record clips and they maintain the files.

Kimata", "ReviewID": "R2VPGJ23KO4RE7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been looking for a simple to use monitoring camera setup, but the models I checked out were for the most part surveillance systems. Also, it became clear they would need some technical expertise to setup properly. Also, maintenance of the recording and remote access features looked like they could require more attention than I was willing to spend. The Dropcam Pro that I got was easy to setup, just as advertised. It never has a problem finding my wireless router and obtaining an IP address, which some of my other wireless components seem to have difficulty doing, so that's a big plus, because I'm often forced to reset the router due to the  many other laps, pads, printers, streamers I've loaded onto my network. The wide angle picture is detailed and takes in my entire living room. At night it turns on its LEDs and you get a night-vision, B&W; picture. I turn the camera on and off remotely with my laptop and iPAD and do my monitoring with just those two devices. Both apps work easily. The sound monitoring is excellent. I can hear the TV clearly over the monitor. However, the talk-back from your remote device over the built-in speaker, which must be tiny, isn't sufficient to compete with the ambient noise in the room if the TV etc. is on. Also, there's a two or three-second delay in the transmit time each way due to, I'm guessing, the net transmission time combined with Dropcam's recording process, which sends the video and audio signals back to its servers for recording. This probably happens whether you decide to subscribe to its recording services or not. So don't expect to conduct two-way voice with much ease.

There are big trade-offs, that Dropcam markets as features worth paying 300% premium. Supposedly, the Dropcam's wide angle lens and image enhancement software make panning and tilting unnecessary, but if you want to mask out motion detection by aiming at a relatively narrow area, then you're out of luck (as far as I can tell). The picture quality isn't as good as I expected it would be. It's better than the Foscam, with more detail and more accurate color, but objects/subjects in the frame appear smaller.Setting up the Dropcam wasn't as smooth as advertised. It didn't see our SSID, and didn't see any of the dozens of SSIDs broadcasted throughout our building. After some tinkering, I was able to get it on our network, but I'm not confident that the camera will reconnect by itself. For a \"wireless\" camera, it sure has a fat ugly USB cable that only serves to setup and supply power. And It would have been nice if they supplied some way of sticking the cable to the wall or ceiling. Another annoying thing about setup was that the installer kept spawning Safari even though Chrome is my default browser and Chrome was already open. Viewing through Safari failed with a \"Blocked Plugin\" error. I haven't used Safari in years, but I suspect that Apple wants to make it difficult to use Adobe Flash.I'm not sold on the architecture. There's a roughly 5 second lag in the \"Live\" broadcast from the upload/download round-trip. I prefer the Foscam on-board server (when it works). It'd be great if I could just log into the camera and see the video.

Zoom is not super important for me, would be nice if it stayed in focus but not a deal breaker for me, love this camera.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Must Consider!
