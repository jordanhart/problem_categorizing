{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awful Remote Viewing", "Author": "W. T. Fork", "ReviewID": "R1ZMQNC5WEGBFN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The company I work for has installed around a dozen of the previous Swann D1 DVR8-4000 units and many of the Swann PRO-752 PTZ Cameras. This DVR9-4200h is the current gen replacement of the DVR8-4000. Right before the DVR8-4000 was discontinued, their last batch had a hardware revision that included a noticeable change from a brick-style power supply to a cheap plugin without the brick. Other than the power supply difference, externally the DVR's and their packaging were identical. Unfortunately there was a major difference for remote monitoring from an external device such as a pc, tablet, or smartphone, the quality of the picture changed from being highly detailed to becoming very fuzzy and blurred. I'm not sure if there were more internal hardware changes such as to a cheaper processor, but the remote viewing quality is poor on the last revision. Viewing directly on the DVR locally with a monitor attached, the quality is good.Fast forward to this new DVR9-4200h model which we have purchased 3 of. For this revision we are given an extra 9th camera connector so you can have 9 camera's instead of 8. Widescreen is also supported. Unfortunately this unit carries over the horrible remote viewing quality of the last batch of DVR8-4000's. Noticeably it features the same cheap wall power supply from that last revision  of DVR8-4000's as well. I don't know what was changed to cause this and it's very unfortunate that the remote viewing quality is so bad. If you do remote viewing be prepared to have very bad picture quality that is void of all fine details.Hopefully the remote viewing issues can be resolved with a future firmware update, but I wouldn't count on it. Swann's support isn't great for anything other than configuration issues or sending hardware in for warranty purposes. The menus and options in this model are very similar to the last as well. If you've ever used a Swann DVR then this one will feel familiar. Recommended for those who won't use or rely on the remote viewing features frequently. Again sitting in front of the DVR itself with a monitor attached, the picture quality will be fine. The one problem with this is if a crook see's you have a DVR there is a good chance they are going to take it so they have a harder time being caught.", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$518.99", "Features": "Swann DVR9-4200 9 Channel 960H DVR", "Name": "Swann DVR9-4200 9 Channel 960H DVR", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31L2U8Z6nQL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DTHBSBG"}}
