{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Only has one video out BNC", "Author": "Jason N.", "ReviewID": "R2YFY2F2ZK6CNM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This unit only has one video out BNC, which means I had to use a BNC splitter in order to view cameras on two different TV's.  Using the splitter has drastically degraded the picture quality.  I realize there is an HDMI out however, unless I use a 50ft HDMI cable, I will not be able to utilize this output.  The menu operation is very cumbersome and the fact that it does not come with a hard drive installed, it is rather expensive in my opinion.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$300.00", "Features": "4 Channel H.264 video compression format; support 960H & D1 resolution\nHDMI output for better resolution\nNew GUI\nPTZ Control\nMultiple operation modes (Preview, record, playback, backup, network surveillance and Mobile monitoring)\nUSB2.0 backup, upgrade and mouse operation", "Name": "GW Security Professional 4 Channel H.264 960H & D1 Realtime Network DVR with HDMI & VGA for Security Camera System - 960\u00d7480 & 30FPS Recording, 11fps WD1 Playback speed. iPhone, Android Viewing (No Hard Drive Installed)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J0ZocrCeL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DJF77FY"}}
