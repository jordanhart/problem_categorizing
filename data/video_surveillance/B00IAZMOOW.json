I asked a lot of question before I bought the SCNC 3706 and Sharx Security was very quick to respond.  Was only going to buy one camera but after seeing this one operate will add another.", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "The best!", "Author": "ExE122", "ReviewID": "R35DK9PM2OZ3JR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have tried a wide range of home security solutions, so I do have some experience with what works and what doesn't.  My first system included two cheap SWANN cameras recording onto a computer.  I eventually upgraded to a QSee system with a CIB DVR.  I had several frustrations with this, including needing several power adapters, RCA/BNC/DIN converters, fixed length cables, junky DVR software, etc.A few years later, I decided to spend a little more and try out the Sharx cameras.  I'm now wishing I would have never spent money on anything else.Some important points:-Technology: If you aren't familiar with terms like NAS, PoE, DHCP, and fixed IPs, you might find this system a little complicated to set up.  As an IT nerd, I found it pretty fun.-Quality of the cameras.  While they are rather large, the Sharx cameras feel very sturdy and are made with top quality materials.  Not that I've tried, but I feel like you could hit these with a baseball bat and they wouldn't get more than a scratch.-Video and night vision quality.  The picture is very clear, even for 480P.  My other system has 600TVL resolution and I find it to be hazier than the Sharx system.  While there aren't many IR bulbs in this system, the ones that are there appear to be very strong.  The night vision picture is still discernible several feet away.-Storage options.  I have set up multiple systems now, one using the built in SD card (though I upgraded to 32GB) and another recording to a NAS.  Both systems work great.  I like the NAS system because of the larger storage capacity and quicker video review.  Videos take a longer time to download off of the SD card (about 1 min) whereas they come up almost instantly on the NAS.  However, the SD card feature is nice because a NAS can end up stolen a lot easier than the camera can.-Power options.  I have one system using wireless cameras connected to power outlets, and another using PoE.  Both work great.-Embedded software.  This is probably the best thing about these cameras.  Each runs its own web server.  You can access it through any web browser connected to the same network.  You just type in the camera's ip, log in, and you are good to go.  My previous DVR systems were much more complex to use and set up.  The software was all proprietary, with clunky and hard to navigate user interfaces.  However, the Sharx system uses simple and familiar looking browser based software.  The browser page lets you set up all sorts of schedules, alerts, motion detection fields, etc.  The only thing I would like to see is some way to join multiple Sharx cameras together so that you don't have to log into each one separately (not too big a deal though).Overall I would highly recommend these cameras above any others.  I have purchased 8 Sharx cameras so far, used at three different locations.  Each has lasted through a very hot summer and a very cold winter.  While some of the initial setup might be tricky for a non-tech person, the system will stay active and maintenance-free once you do get it running.", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00IAZMOOW"}}
