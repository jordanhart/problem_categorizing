I purchased this for outside home surveillance as our neighbors are questionable at best.  Now I can simply switch my TV input over and see what is going on instead of standing at my front window.  The camera quality is great and it does record in real time.  The night vision works excellent and I get about 100ft of usable video distance at night, more than needed in my situation.  I've used all 8 cameras, which is a bit of an overkill at my residence, but there is no external area uncovered by a camera now.  The most useful has been the porch mount as I get excellent face and body coverage of anyone at my door, whether I'm there or not.  I haven't used the remote connectivity yet, it's not really a concern for and I feel like I'd obsess over it and have to watch my house all the time.- A word about Lorex's professional install service:I went online just to see what it would cost me to have it professionally installed, and there was a card included in the pack.  After spending about 20 minutes online filling out camera installation areas and square footage, I submitted the form and got the \"someone will call you\" page.  This was irritating, but I went with it.  About 2 days later I received a call from them.  They obviously didn't look at anything I filled out, which further irritated me.  I stopped the person who called from going through their whole speech and asked them what the average cost is.  The stated it was $100-$200 per camera to install, plus and additional fee (I never did get an actual price) for installing the DVR and connecting it to the internet.  So, essentially, a $300 camera system would cost me a minimum of $2000 to install.  I told them forget it and did it myself.  It is very easy as all the connectors are already installed on the wiring.  The hardest part of the whole install is positioning of the cameras and getting the wiring down the inside of the wall.", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not worth time or money", "Author": "ACD", "ReviewID": "R3JTYR2RELC6M2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you're truly concerned with security at your home or small office, this is a bad buy and a waste of your hard earned money. The system itself performs as its supposed to: it will record and capture video and you can access it on the network to look at a live view.But consider this: this is a reactive approach to security. If someone steals your valuables and you have it recorded on video, what then? You can turn it into the police, but unless they have a crystal clear image of the individual(s) and that person is a known criminal in their system or you can identify them, then you are SOL. In other words, file an insurance claim and hope for the best, because the police can't do anything.Did you know that video surveillance isn't admissible in court as evidence unless it can be identified by a witness? That means you had to either be watching them steal your valuables on your phone while this was happening or someone at the location of the crime witnessed the act while the video was recording and can testify to the matter. This system will really offer you 0 value unless you intend to use it to monitor employee behavior. I would highly recommend investing in an alarm service or video monitoring service, or hiring a consultant to provide details on how to make your home or office more secure (such as adding lighting or building a fence).
