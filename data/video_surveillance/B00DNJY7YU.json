Image quality in daylight is slightly better than the Samsung SDC-5340BC cameras that came with the system.  Darkness is where the difference really shows itself...  The Swann's stay in \"color\" mode under much lower light conditions than the Samsungs.  Also, even when in night mode, they will pick up colors if light is available.  Images in the darkness are much clearer than the Samsungs.  If you're looking for a slight upgrade to stock 600L cameras, this does the job.  Will update review after long term use if needed.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "MYRON", "ReviewID": "R2L4SDJ1SVOID8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Glad I bought this set.
