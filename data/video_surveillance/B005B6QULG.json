{"Reviews": [{"Title": "These cameras are great! Here's some help setting them up.", "Author": "jammendolia", "ReviewID": "R21Q7KWXFGITVR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've read the negative reviews, and let me just say that I suspect the people writing them were just a little confused about how to set up and operate these cameras. I agree that the directions are terrible! (I mean really bad) but if you've got any level of technical know-how, you wont have any trouble figuring these things out.Here's some help getting them set up:Note: If you're configuring multiple cameras, I recommend you do the configuration one camera at a time. Leave additional cameras unplugged to prevent any confusion while obtaining settings information.First, you can't just plug the camera in and expect it to work if you have a wireless network that requires a passkey to connect. (You do protect your network, don't you?!) In fact, I thinkg the wireless settings are disabled by default anyway. So, to get on the network, connect the camera to your wireless router using the provided network cable. This way it can get on the network without needing a password (This is exactly what they say to do in step one in the user's manual).Next, insert the CD, and it should auto-run - Oh, I guess I should point out that this part of the instructions are for Windows based PCs. If you're running mac/*nux, then I suggest you borrow a windows laptop or run a virtual windows install to get this done. (Too bad they didn't supply a native app). If you're technical enough though, I'm sure you can figure out how to find your cam on the network. If so, then you wont even need to run the CD. (Hint: look at your router's DHCP client list.)Assuming you are on Windows; When the EasyN window appears, click on \"Search IP Camera\". On the \"Select Mode\" screen, click the \"Advance Mode\" button. In the \"Equipments\" box, you should see a list, and the camera should be in it.  Should be Series F, name IPCAM1, IP ###.###.###.###. single click this line in the list to select that camera. Now in the right hand side, you should see detailed info. What you're concerned with now is the HTTP Port #. Write down the IP Address and HTTP Port# of the camera, and you'll also want to write down the \"sunet mask\", \"gateway\", and \"primary DNS\" values from the top left pane of this window. You'll need them later when setting up the network settings for the camera.Once you know the camera's details, you can close this program.Next, open your web browser and in the address bar put  [...]  where ###.###.###.### is the IP address for the camera and PP is the HTTP Port that you found above. It should look something like:  [...] (but the numbers may be different for you).Now you should get a login prompt. The default login is \"admin\" (no quotes), and there is no password. Once you log in, you'll see a menu.The option you choose here depends on which browser you're using.  If you are using Internet Explorer, use the ActiveX mode (the top one in the list). This one is the most full featured (i.e. will let you control the camera, and hear/send audio from/to the camera). If you're not using Internet Explorer, select the second option \"Server Push Mode\". This mode still allows you to control the camera, but doesn't support audio. (I wish they had used a java or flash viewer. I hate IE, and refuse to use it. But the IE version is the only one that supports the extended features.)Regardless of which one you selected, you should now see the camera viewer with controls at the right. You'll want to click the \"options\" icon (looks like a gear) at the bottom of the controls.Once in the \"EasyN IP Camera Options\" screen, there is a menu on the left. Just follow along:First, I set my own admin username and password.  Do this from the \"Users Settings\" menu. I highly recommend you change the user name and password. Just click into the box that currently says \"admin\" and change it to something else that you'll remember. Then click into the Password field to the right, and enter a password you'll remember. Make sure group still says \"Administrator\". Then click the \"Set\" button at the bottom.  You'll be prompted to log in again. Use the username and password you just set.  The device will reboot. Just be patient because once it's finished, you'll be back on the device status page.Next, I turned off the DDNS feature they offer. I don't want just anyone being able to connect to my cameras from outside. I know they're password protected, but I was able to find a way to capture an image without a password. So I suggest everyone turn this feature off. This can be done on the \"DDNS Service Settings\" menu. select \"none\" in the \"DDNS Service\" dropdown then click \"Set\". Again, device may reboot.  Just be patient.Next, I set up my network configuration.Go to the \"Basic Network Settings\" menu, I recommend you uncheck the \"Obtain IP from DHCP Server\", then set the IP Address and other details according to your network config. In my environment, My camera IP was 192.168.1.12. But I decided to set a fixed address for each camera so they'd never change. I wanted to have my cameras start at 192.168.1.240 and each additional camera, I would set up with that same address + 1 (i.e. 192.168.1.241 then 192.168.1.242, etc.) So,  I unchecked the \"Obtain IP from DHCP server\", then in the \"IP Address\" box, I put \"192.168.1.240\" (no quotes).One important thing to note. when you select an IP address for your camera, be sure you only change the last number. The first 3 numbers should stay the same (i.e. 192.168.1.xxx, only change the xxx part). Also, be sure you don't set the value to 0(zero) or a number higher than 254. And finally, make sure you don't set it to the same value as your computer, or the gateway. I recommend picking a value well above the DHCP range defined in your wireless router's configuration. You can get that info from your wireless router's admin page. (use google or the manual for help if you're not sure how to find it.)Next, in the \"Subnet Mask\" box, I put \"255.255.255.0\" (Yours is probably the same). In the \"Gateway\" box, enter the value for Gateway that you wrote down earlier. In the \"DNS Server\" box you'll enter whatever value you wrote down for \"Primary DNS\" earlier. And finally, in the \"Http Port\" box, you can put any numeric value you want here, but I recommend you just leave it set to \"81\". Then click the \"Set\" button.Ok, now your camera is going to reboot. But this time, you will not automatically end up back in the menu (the IP address is now going to be whatever you set it to above). So, you will need to change the location in the browser to [...] where ###.###.###.### is the IP address you set above, and PP is the port you set. (note. you may need to wait 20 seconds or so for the camera to reboot before you can access it again). You will be asked to log in again. Use the new login info you set up above. After that, you should be back on the main menu screen. Go into the ActiveX or Server Push mode screen, and click the gear icon again.Now to get wireless working.You should be back on the \"EasyN IP Camera Options\" screen. If not, get back to it, then Click the \"Wireless Lan Settings\" option in the left menu.Click \"Scan\". You should see a list of available access points appear. You'll want to select yours from the list. Make sure the \"Use Wireless Lan\" box is checked. When you selected your access point, it should have pre-filled the remaining values except \"Share Key\".Ok, I dont know if it auto selects the correct \"Encryption\" option, and selecting the correct one can be a little tricky if you dont know how your wireless router is set up. You can find this out by looking at your router's configuration screen, but most likely, it'll be one of the WPA or WPA2 options. I'm not going to talk you through finding this info though. For that, search google, or refer to your router's manual (Hint: you'll need to look at the wireless security settings to get the right encryption type).Once you know the correct Encryption type, select it from the dropdown, then enter your wireless password into the \"Share Key\" box. Once done, click \"Set\".The camera should reboot again. At this point, you should unplug the network cable from the back of the camera. It should now connect wirelessly.You'll know it worked if you can get to it in your browser. Again, give it 20 seconds or so before you give up trying. If it still doesnt connect, plug the cable back, give it a few more seconds, then refresh the page, and check your settings. (You may not have the correct Encryption type set or the wrong Share Key). Keep trying. You will find the right value. just repeat the wireless setup using different values for encryption type. Assuming you are entering the correct share key (case probably matters), one of them should work.At this point, I assume you have wireless working.If you want to be able to access the camera from the internet, you'll need to set up a port forward on your router. Again, refer to your router's manual, or google for how to do it (there are a plethora of online tutorials for every router model ever made).On mine, I set up external port 801 -> 192.168.1.240:81 and because I have more than one camera, I also set up external port 802 -> 192.168.1.241:81.  this way I can just go to [...] (or:802) to view each camera. I recommend [...] for dynamic DNS. Yes the camera does support ddns, but I highly recommend you not use it because anyone who is familiar with their setup could potentially access your camera. Instead, get a freedns.afraid.org address, and set up your main computer to keep the address updated with the correct external IP. (again, google is your friend here. there are plenty of tutorials around for doing this)Once you have your port forwards in place, and you have verified you can get to the cameras from outside, the next step is probably a mobile device viewer.  The included viewer is junk. I repeat JUNK!  However, I came across an application for iOS that supports these cameras quite well! (including listening to the audio stream). It's called \"uNetCams\" ([...]) . It's not free, but well worth the money! As for Android, there are some viewers out there, and I suspect they work fine, but I haven't tested them.One final note:  If you are going to be accessing the cameras from outside, I suggest you add an additional user in the \"Users Settings\" section of the options window. You can enter up to 7 additional users, and assign each one its own security level. Just add a second user with its own password, and give it the \"Viewer\" permission. Then use that user info when configuring the mobile viewer. This way, even if someone was able to \"sniff\" your settings, they wouldn't have administrative access to you camera.Hope this writeup helps somebody!

I am disappointed in the iphone/ipad software. It does't seem to get the camera to load at all.  I have tried it both with 3G and with a local wifi connection and the software still doesn't work. I don't have any problems viewing security cameras through commercial services on my iphone or ipad.The documentation isn't very clear either.  I took my relatively advanced level of networking skills to get the camera to work over the internet.  They had a domain that they use, that is supposed to work, but I could not get it to work.  I had to manually configure a port through the router's firewall, and finally guess at the IP address of the camera to work. Once I did that, it worked very well over the internet. IE9 version of the software the comes with it likes to crash, and the software for the other web browsers tend to be sluggish, especally  when trying to panBottom line is this is an excellent camera if you are looking to use it on a PC inside the same network it is on. If that is how you use the camera, it is easy to use.  If you are planning on using it on a PC over the internet, it will be a test of your networking skills the you may enjoy. I don't know if I enjoyed the test, but I did enjoy passing the test.  If you are planning on viewing it on your iphone or ipad, this is not the camera for you.I give the software 1.5 stars, but the camera is a solid 5 star.

I was going out of town and wanted a camera where I could keep an eye on my house while I was gone.  Initial setup was a little sketchy.  I was on a wireless laptop and I had the camera wired into the router.  Apparently the camera doesn't just get an address from DHCP like any normal host.  It has a pre-configured IP address.  Luckily the setup software has a setting where you can just directly attach the camera to the PC via ethernet.  Once I did that, the software discovered the device.  I was able to give the camera an IP address for my network and give it the wireless settings it needed to connect to the WIFI.Then the real fun started.  So you can view live video, pan, tilt and control the video settings but you can also do the following...-Configure the camera to activate on motion and send pictures in an email.  (You can use gmail for free)-Set a schedule for the motion alarmThese are very important to me because if someone breaks in and sees the camera it should have enough time to snap some pics and send them to me before they smash or unplug the camera.Overall I'm completely satisfied with the camera's functions.  I was looking at Cisco units for around $250 that aren't as feature-rich as this unit.  I'm thinking about buying a couple more because you can view multiple feeds through one web interface.EDIT:  Initially my camera's green light would flash constantly.  I found how to disable that.Go to settings>PTZ Settings> and set Indicator Display Mode to \"Been Extinguished\"", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Mewers", "ReviewID": "RUT1LB9JCZQR0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had it a few days, and so far this camera is amazing.

(which it didn't alert a wrong password, it just wouldn't change the gateway/ip settings... so it made me read the manual)The image quality is good, and the pan/tilt is really good also... and it seems to be at least a little durable, as when I first got it, before installing it, i was playing around with my cat.. and he knocked it a few feet to the ground, and it was fine.Given this is the first IP Camera i have purchased, I couldn't imagine wanting any more out of your camera except for being weather proof.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Some tips for setup Wireless once done Great Unit!!!", "Author": "Mookie6870", "ReviewID": "RGLEVX2CJOVCR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had IPCam up in 15 min.  The booklet nor the CD software tells you to connect cam to your local network with a wire on a 192.168.1.x network.  I notice on the box the box the IPCam had a 192.168.1.126 IP which would cause a problem of my network as it was set to 10.0.0.x.  Once I set my laptop to the 192.168.1.2 I was able to configure the IPCam to my network with a static IP of 10.0.0.126.Now after configuring the IPCam to your network you can log into the Cam to setup the wireless configuration which is not in the book clearly.After you are able to log into the IPCam, look for the wireless section and their should be a button to search for network.  Your network and others should pop up.  Choose yours network name and enter your security key or paraphrase.Once this is done the IPcam will reboot and take up to 5 min to restart then you should be able to connect wirelessly and control it.I received my unit March 31, 2012 I must say I think the unit on is great for the price!

Seller CameraTec has said they offer a 1-year warranty (though you're stuck with shipping charges), but I wouldn't assume all sellers here will do the same.  The company (EasyN) has NO US PRESENCE, so they don't offer or honor any warranties for products sold in this country.The only real upgrade from these types of cameras is going with one that does H.264 video compression (instead of just MJPEG) and/or that can act as a DVR, recording up to 2-weeks of video to an internal micro SD card slot, such as the Esky 5900.  Those also have switchable IR filters for more-accurate color, and the IR lights can be shut-off in the settings.  But there are lots of negative reports about MJPEG performance being only 1FPS, and with the price being nearly double, I opted for this camera instead.  Or you can go with one of THESE if you just want the SD DVR function, without networking or pan/tilt, for 20% less than this camera.This camera comes with a much wider-angle lens than my previous IP camera, which is the better choice in most scenarios, and I'm happier to have a larger view.  However, this unit's picture quality is just slightly poorer all-around, and noticeably less sensitive in the dark.Works reliably with Firefox, tinycam on Android (video and audio send/receive), and recording the MJPEG stream with my custom scripts.  The ability to limit maximum frame rate was absent in older firmware, and is an absolutely great feature that saves bandwidth and delivers more consistent timing.  This one isn't crashing at all, after running (and recording) for days, unlike my previous camera that cost twice as much, which would suddenly reset itself every few hours (and a better power supply didn't help).To initially set this camera up, just plug it into your network and power it up.  It will grab an IP address from the DHCP server.  Use a port-scanner (like nmap) to quickly scan your network for just port 81.  Type the IP address of the camera, with \":81\" on the end of it, in your web brower address bar.  Default user/password is \"admin\" and (blank) \"\".  When creating user accounts, limit the password to 8 characters, an old http-auth issue.  Disable DHCP and type a static IP address.  Click \"scan\" button a few times until it picks up your WiFi, then select it, chose the encryption and type in your key, then click \"set\" and unplug the ethernet cable while rebooting, and it should be reachable on WiFi, and you're good to go.  To access it outside of your network, you need to open and forward a port on your router/nat/firewall, and the procedure to do that varies greatly from one manufacturer to the next.If you'd like more control than the web interface gives you, search the web for \"ip camera cgi pdf\".  There are more settings available than you know.  Most notably, you can set pan/tilt speeds 10X slower, you can set periodic horizontal and/or vertical patrols every few minutes.  etc.", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera at a great price", "Author": "cashxx \"cashxx\"", "ReviewID": "R1HBTRB4YDG3ME", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love these cams for the price!

The included instructions are essentially useless.  Instead, search here for the review by jammendolia which contains step-by-step information for getting this camera set up. Without it, I would probably would have sent this back and gotten a refund.That being said, even the instructions by jammendolla aren't fool proof. They start off by advising to install the software that comes on the included CD, which is supposed to auto-run and walk you through installation.  It doesn't...I tried two different PCs - one running Win7 and one running XP.  The disk wouldn't run on either.  I opened the disk tried double-clicking on the installer as well as other included applications, and each time I got an error message that said \"this is not a valid Win32 application,\" even though it had a .exe extension.I finally gave up on the CD, and did a google search to see if I could download the software. The one program you really need is \"Search IP Camera,\" and I was actually able to download it from the EasyN website. (It's a .rar archive, so you'll have to have a program like WinZip to unpack it.)The downloaded version worked just fine.  But bear in mind - getting this software is just the beginning in a fairly involved process.There is no excuse for shipping an installer disk with errors, and there's no reason it should take a degree in computer science to install a freakin' webcam!

I did at least 5 hours of research, reading each camera's reviews, decided to buy all 3 and try all 3. All the same product, different operating systems, slightly different hardware. I returned everything else and kept the EasyN. The first camera took me 3 hours to install. I ordered 3 more EasyN FS613s and installed all 3 of them, simultaneously, using a MAC, within 20 minutes.Bottom Line:This is the cheapest IP Camera on the market. It is incredibly durable and reliable for just remote controlled viewing on your iPhone. Don't expect amazing customer service and well written manuals. If you're a beginner and planning to buy this, do not expect an easy install unless you have a friend who has done it before or a reliable forum to ask questions and receive answers. The product itself is good, its amazing for the price, but the infrastructure behind it...is almost non existent.Cons:Installation:Installation Manual is useless. If you are a beginner, refer to forums and ask around. DO NOT just start hacking/typing/editing away. You will lock yourself outta the camera, force a factory reset, and eventually refer to the forums, save yourself time, start by reading the forums.Installation is built for Windows. Mac is completely possible. I did it. You cannot just follow directions and get this installed, it will be so frustrating. You have to conceptually understand how an IP Camera works. Then you'll be able to easily install.Audio:There is Wi-Fi and Power Supply Interference on the audio. You cannot use this as a baby monitor unless you make some modifications (solder, external microphone).iPhone App:I PAID $2.99 for IP Cam Viewer, otherwise all the other FREE apps, do not provide audio. Internet Explorer/Mozilla/Chrome/ANY Mac App camera viewer will not provide AUDIO. I have searched high and low, and the only way to get audio is a 3rd party PAID iPhone App or using a Windows system and installing EasyN's camera program.Pros:Extremely durable. I've dropped the camera, my kid has put his mouth all over it, he's twisted the camera and it still manages to fix itself if you move it back into 'reset position'Can add up to 64 cameras.

All you have to do is to plug the camera up to your router, plug in power, then after a min or so it will show up in your DHCP client list on your router's setup page.

Sengstock \"Pete\"", "ReviewID": "R5ELK5IVGOBQH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got three of these with the hopes of being able to set up a cheap monitoring system at home.  The interface for the cameras is pretty clunky, but I didn't expect much more for what they cost.  I found them to be most reliable when using a static IP instead of DHCP.  Testing them over ethernet worked great, but when I transitioned them all to wireless (802.11g), they were spotty at best.The wireless router they were connected to was a brand new Netgear R7000, and there weren't any issues at that end.  When testing the connection and pings over ethernet, I couldn't find any faults with the cameras.  They really worked great.  The only thing that would have made them better in that configuration is if they also supported PoE.  When testing pings to each camera over the wireless, there was a LOT of latency and dropped packets.  If the cameras were in close proximity to the wireless router and had little to no object interference, the pings were very consistent, and they would rarely drop any packets.  I moved one camera to another room, and it started dropping packets like crazy.  Connecting this same camera to a wireless bridge in that room eliminated the dropped packets.  This suggests that the wireless transmitters in these cameras just aren't up to today's standards.  One regular drywall wall shouldn't be enough to kill 802.11g.Things got even worse when I attempted to pull video from the cameras wirelessly.  Over ethernet, I could max out the resolution and frame rate on each camera.  Over wireless, I got spotty results running at half resolution and 10fps.  After a while, the each camera would eventually drop off the network.  Sometimes they would come back on their own, but most times they needed to be reset manually.  I noticed that the individual ping times to each camera would gradually build and build as soon as you started streaming video from them.  We're talking pings of up to 1600ms before the cameras dropped off the network.  The frequency of dropped packets also increased after starting the video feed.  Again, it seems like the wireless transmitters just aren't up to snuff, because I had no issues running these cameras over ethernet.I was very hopeful for these cameras due to the feature set (it even seems like there are custom CGI commands that you can run) and the overall cost.  Because these were purchased specifically for wireless use, and that was the one way in which they could not perform, I had to return them.  If you're looking for a cheap cheap cheap WIRED pan/tilt camera solution, then these will probably work fine.  If wireless is a requirement, look for something else.If you do want to use these (or any IP camera, really), I strongly suggest you look into a free product called iSpy (www.ispyconnect.com).

Easier than a normal router and that says alot.To set it up, connect it via LAN (it must be wired for setup, wireless works later).  Once connected, insert the CD they provided which runs on windows and goto IP Camera Detection -> Advanced.  It will give you the IP of the Camera.  It is on port 81 so it will be [...] for example.Once there you can configure it.

Download IpCamera Pro from App Store, with that you can control mic, pan tilt, etc from the iPhone in real time, works amazing with this camera.Overall: HIGHLY recommended.  Setup is easy, features are great, it works outstanding.  For the price you cannot beat this.  I have it outside in a covered environment but it does get moist and it does not hurt it.  I do not think this is water proof so do not put it in direct rain.P.S. This is just as good or better than Foscam models and costs half the price FYI.----------------UPDATE: It has been about a year and this thing is still going strong! Can be controlled with reecam, a free app from the maker on iPhone.  Love this thing.  I have it mounted outside in warm, tropical, rainy conditions.  It is not in direct water/rain and I would not suggest you do, it's on my semi-covered porch.  No issue at all, no wear, no problem, no foggy lens, etc.  I would highly recommend this product.

Doesn't even recognize the camera (unless you use the local IP).The software (web application) to administrate the camera is not bad, but it could be improved.Here's a step to step conceptual guide to configure the camera (it's difficult with the manual).1) After plugging the camera to the power supply, connect the LAN (grey) cable to your router.  Go to your favorite browser and type 192.168.1.126:81 (this is port 81)  user: admin, password empty.2) Configure the wireless connection (from now on, you won't need the lan cable anymore).  Configure all other things like user and password, alerts, FTP upload, email settings (not really needed at this point, but useful to have),3) HOW TO ACCESS FROM THE INTERNETYou probably have a dynamic IP, and this causes problems of access when it changes.For this reason you need to configure a Dynamic DNS hostname (DDNS). This is an online service (free or paid) you can get and configure in the camera options.I use [...]/ (that I can configure from the router directly)Then, you will need to configure your router's PORT FORWARDING, pointing any port of your choice (which will be set in the dynamic DNS) to port 81.Once configured, you can access, for example, mycamera.dyndns.org from anywhere and it will redirect you to your computer's updated IP.4)Mobile APP (phone, tablet)I have purchased an APP called IPCam viewer pro, from google play store, for $5.It has all I need to view and manage the camera and activate/deactivate the motion detection feature.I'm happy with it, and it fulfills its purpose.Remember this is a conceptual guide and you will have to google for more info.

The sound seemed to work when I first got the camera, but does nothing now, maybe because I'm at a different computer with IE9, but I cannot get it to work at all. So I am suspecting it may work with older browsers only which does no good. The video quality is very poor and forget about color, they are completely off due to the IR. The video performance is also very choppy. Sometimes pan and tilt work, other times it doesn't. This camera can also be buggy at times. The motion alarm is iffy, sometimes it works, other times it don't. It wont let you cycle through the presets like its supposed to. The record function does not work. The webpage that you get to view the camera is rather ugly. P2P mode is always tiring to connect. Setup is a real pain in the butt. Sometimes it doesn't even setup properly and you have to fight with it. Forget about updating it. I heard that tech support actually has to do it for you. The only DNS server you can use with it is theirs which is at ipcam.hk. And that's assigned to you which mine did not correlate with the box.

If you had to rely on the documentation that came with the camera it would take much longer.  I was up and running pretty quick.  There is also a site out there for EasyN cameras that has a link to different router port forwarding instructions.  I am at work looking through the camera on my iPhone.  Works great.  On the iPhone it is definitely worth the price to get the UCamPro vs. the EasyN camera app.  The UCamPro seems to support all of the camera functions and a few others.  Very clear picture and the pan/tilt controls work great.  For the price, I think this is a bargain.  If you can get through the setup it works well.  As far as the missing zoom, the iPhone app allows digital zoom and at the highest resolution it works fine just by pinching and spreading.Suggestions:Read through some of the reviews that have step-by-step instructions.  If you don't know how to setup port forwarding on your router do an Internet search.  Be patient.  One time it just wouldn't connect during all of the setup after a reboot.  Removing power and plugging it back in allowed it to reconnect.  After that I have not had any problems.One thing that may make me exchange it is when I plug the camera in it throws a fairly big spark.  May send it back for another of the same.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "John E Boy", "ReviewID": "RTGMAEHHUVAZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera is great; the pan/tilt, light, motion sensor... all of it works really well. no complaints with any of the basic functions. The Audio / Microphone is terrible. I placed the camera in 2 indoor locations, and 2 outdoor locations with the same noise level problems. I have not tested the speaker yet. Audio and Microphone were not deal breakers for me.The software cd it ships with is useless. If you're going to rely on the software cd then you are going to have problems getting the camera configured and working on your network. It's a night and day difference configuring it manually versus using the software it ships with.I was only able to test the Android client, and it also was a bag of failure. I would suggest using a 3rd party software, \"IP Cam Viewer\" works really well!The remote management of the camera was also simple enough; I use linux, and chrome -- no problems configuring or accessing. Again -- the native software failed to install properly on my Windows systems, and I wanted a manual configuration anyways.I have no problems accessing via wired, or wifi (tested all the security protocols) after reboots. I simulated a power outage without any issues when I restored power (settings retained, etc.)In summary, the easiest method I found:1) place camera on the wired segment of your LAN (plug a cat 5/6 cable into your camera, power it on)2) log in to your router, see what systems _just_ pulled a new dhcp address (i think the default hostname is IPCAM)3) put the IP in your browser, log in using the default credentials (something actually listed in the manual)4) configure...", "Date": "October 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Happy with the Camera", "Author": "Christopher Sipos \"Jo Mama\"", "ReviewID": "RFD3YNA6T3WPI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Don't try and set=up yourself, unless you are a Guru.
