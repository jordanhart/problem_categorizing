In actuality the one I received is a shade of black. It comes with a black rubber band which seems to be decent quality, but it is pretty short. I am an average sized man and I use the second to last hole in the band to secure it on my wrist. If you are a large person, this will not fit you. It comes in a box which is nicely packed to protect the watch. Inside was the USB cable, the watch and instructions. The instructions were pretty good with a numbered step by step on how to get going. There were a few inconsistencies in them with minor things such as the light colors. The watch clearly has a blue light, and the instructions said red and green. To start I had to unscrew the back of the watch and figure out how to insert the MicroSD card. It wasn't too tough, but you have to remove the battery and slide to unlock the place where it goes. You can't really tell by looking at it if the card slides in, or if it lifts up to put it in. I got it in and replaced the battery as instructed. I am really not sure if this is supposed to be water resistant or not, however I can tell you that this watch will not deal with even a minimal dip in some water. The USB cover on the side which is disguised as a winding knob and the back of the watch are both designed to tighten and loosen by hand.Performance:HD Video is very clear outdoors and indoors with good light and has low but clear and audible sound.Still pictures are also very clear.Automatic IR functions, but the videos in a dark room with no light are really too dark to be of any practical use.I used a Sandisk 32Gb Class 10 MicroSD. File transfers of the large video files were lightning fast, even on a USB 2.0 Port.In summary. I got my $60 worth. I am happy I bought this one.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "PRODUCT PERFORMANCE", "Author": "Fongefossoh A.", "ReviewID": "R1X7MH6HDX4I84", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT, BUT NOT EASY TO OPERATE. YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY PRESS ONE BUTTON OR THE OTHER THEREBY EXPOSING THE FACT THAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A HIDDEN CAMERA OPERATION.. OFTEN  IT DOES NOT ENTER THE MODE ONE WANTS TO GET INTO  UNTIL ONE REPEATS THAT MODE SEVERAL TIMES.NOT BAD.The pen  fell apart as soon as I wanted to use it, so I cannot say much about its performance. You can send me a better one since since my money is still in my account.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "This thing rocks!!", "Author": "justin", "ReviewID": "R3R0IVWGE4GAW6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I cant say where I went last night with this on my wrist, but I have up close and personal footage, very clear, in a dark area with a lot of naked members of the opposite sex.
