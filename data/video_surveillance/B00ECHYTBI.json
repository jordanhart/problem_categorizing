No issues with the signal. No complaints at all.Mae from Infant Optics contacted me out of the blue a few weeks ago to check in and see if the monitor was working as expected. I wrote back to say that all seemed to be good. She wrote back shortly after that and stated that Infant Optics was making a push to get customers to sign up for the warranty that comes with the unit. Since I had already signed up for the warranty, Mae said she wanted to send me a free wide-angle lens as a thank you. I sent her my shipping information and several days later, I received the lens in my mailbox. I did not pay a cent for this-- not even for shipping. In a world where \"free\" almost always comes with a hidden cost, I greatly appreciated this gesture.The quality of this baby monitor seems great (from my limited use so far), and the customer service is definitely great.

She quickly realized that we needed a replacement monitor.  As soon as I finished talking with her, i send back the broken monitor and emailed a copy of the UPS receipt for the monitor I sent back and the same day a new monitor was ordered for us us, which we received  by Tuesday.The new monitor we received no longer has that annoying beep that you see in many reviews.

Additional cameras are available, unlike another system I was considering buying until after struggling to try and understand their representatives broken English it became apparent that you couldn't purchase additional cameras (even though their add specifically stated \"can add up to 4 cameras\"). The only way you could get additional cameras with that company, was to buy additional systems. When I mention that was at the very least deceptive advertising, if not false advertising their representative hung up on me. The additional cameras with this system are absolutely simple to pair up.The system can scan from one camera to the next or just monitor one camera at a time.  As if the features, the quality, and the price isn't enough incentive, their Customer Service is by far above and beyond any company I've ever dealt with before.

I bought this monitor to use  in 3 different rooms of our home. We knew we wanted pan & tilt and we needed 3 cameras. Budget was an issue and to us, this was an investment. I did not want to have a wi-fi camera because I am on my phone way too much as it is, the battery would always be dead, and you cant talk on the phone and watch the kids at the same time. We use this in the baby's room, the toddler's room, and a play area in the basement so I can keep an eye on the toddler while making dinner. Other monitors have too many options and the blaring music going through the camera and all the buttons everywhere (lorex) but really all you need is the pan and tilt, the temperature, and the talk back. I use our talk back button almost every time one of them is asleep to let them know I am coming and it is ok. They will stop crying and stare right up at the camera because the sound is so clear. It is not scary. It is also nice when the toddler thinks it is ok to get out of bed and i can catch him and tell him \"get back in bed!\" without going in his room 1 hundred times. Turning the volume up and down is easy and scanning and tilting the awesome camera is just as simple. The best part is that you can actually SEE the kids and if they are asleep or their eyes are open. Both cameras are quite far from the beds and we have black out curtains in their rooms. ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM.  I recently had an issue with my parent monitor and Mae at Infant Optics made the exchange so easy and flawless. I had a new monitor in my hands the next day. You have no idea how amazing a product is until you have to live without it for 24 hours. totally worth the money, the sanity, your time, the customer service, and more importantly the peace of mind of watching your cutie pies sleep and play safely.", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Monitor", "Author": "George Hilios", "ReviewID": "RHIGKUGOPE0CF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We got this monitor when our baby was about a week old. It's easy to set up and use and the image is fantastic - even in the dark. We were very impressed. Downsides, the battery only lasts 6 hrs and starts beeping to announce it needs to be plugged in. Not usually that big of a deal but I was pretty sleep deprived, not thinking about charging electronics, and when this would wake me up and not the baby... oh boy, not good. I finally learned just to plug it in every time I went to sleep.The talk function is nice - you can talk through the monitor to the baby in her room.

They've changed the problematic beeping as of March 2014 so that is no longer an issue. A few weeks ago I tried to plug my charger chord into the monitor screen (apparently a bit too hard) and the connecting piece came loose, fell into the monitor, and it would no longer charge. I called the company, and they returned my phone call within 5 minutes from caller ID (I left no message) to see if they could help me. I told Mae of the problem and she had me send the monitor back. As soon as I had texted the picture of the package at the post office, they sent me a new monitor (which got there the next day) without even waiting to receive the monitor from me. The new monitor works wonderfully, and Mae followed up to make sure everything was satisfactory. I've bought many thousands of dollars worth of products on Amazon in the last year, and this is the best customer service I've received.Now what I like about the camera: The one thing I didn't like (the beeping) is now eliminated with the March 2014 version. I love that I can move the camera when I'm not in the room to adjust the view or to check something like if the baby's blanket is still covering her feet. It also makes it much easier to get a good view from anywhere not just one specific location. I also like the zoom function and the room temperature check function. The chord on the camera is really long so that I can move it all around the room depending on if the baby is in her swing, rocking sleeper, crib, etc., without unhooking something permanently fixed in one location, like over the crib. I can see if it's dark in the room or light without changing anything (although there is a brightness function if you want it).

We will still keep this but will consider a dropcam that lacks pan and tilt to run in parallel with this system.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not what I hoped for...", "Author": "Kari Anders", "ReviewID": "R3BK5JXEO8MBL7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was excited about this product and I want it to work for our family but it just isn't. I love the idea of the different lens and being able to see both twins in their cribs and the wide area lens for our toddler. What I'm not excited about is that we are on our second unit and the sound continues to go out for no reason. It will just go off in the middle of the night. We finally figured out you have to unplug the camera and plug it back in to get it to work again, but who wants to worry about that. I agree with the rest of the reviews about the horrible beeping sound it makes. I'm not sure because the range is supposed to be better than our old Summer Infant video monitor but it is far from better. I can't even do yard work without that thing constantly beeping. I will say the customer service has been nice about it and are more then willing to exchange it, but we are on our second one. It's tiring, so I'll be picking a new one.", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "I don't usually write reviews but after trying several baby monitors I had to do it for this spectacular item!", "Author": "Adrian D.

If you are in the market for a high end baby monitor, look no further, don't believe me? order it, and if you aren't blown away from the moment you open the box, send it back because it's amazon and I think baby products allow for free returns within 90 days... but I highly doubt you will want to return it after seeing this thing in person...

I use this to monitor my mother who lives in the same house as us. At first we tried a few IP cameras but the software setup and lag drove me nuts.

We were really pleased with all the features until one morning the camera and monitor became \"unsynced\". We went through the trouble shooting with no luck. My wife called the company to request a replacement but didn't expect a response because she called on a Sunday. An hour after calling and not leaving a message my wife received a voicemail from the company apologizing for the missed call and how they could help. We called back and that night a replacement monitor was shipped out. We received the new monitor a day later and a follow up email a week later to check on the performance of the new monitor.We believe that the original monitor was defected because our replacement has not had any problems. The video and sound quality are great and there is no static. The background noise is very minimal which is helpful because our daughter sleeps with a sound machine.I would recommend this product", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great monitor!", "Author": "Morgan Carroll", "ReviewID": "R25D60MUXJJZCF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love how sharp the night vision is on this unit.

First, the range is terrible.  It constantly keeps warning me that I am out of range, this is bizarre to me, as I live in a smaller home and am usually no more then a room away or directly below the nursery.  For 230$, this monitor should have much better range than that.  Secondly, today the monitor completely froze on an image of my baby and the sound went completely out.  The only way out of this was to power it down and power it back up.  Granted, powering it down fixed the issue, but the fact that there was this type of an issue in the first place, within 2 weeks of owning this item, is the reason I'm in the process of sending this item back.  The only reason this item got 2 stars from me is simply because the image (when working) is really clear, I liked that it warned me when the battery was dying, the talk back feature was nice, and I also like that it is relatively quiet.I had higher hopes for this item based on the good reviews, but the one I received is not worth the price of this product.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$239.99", "Features": "First-ever monitor with interchangeable optical lens capability - allowing you to customize viewing angle and zoom\nLarge 3.5\" full color LCD display in sleek, compact unit with retractable antenna, with sound-activated LED display\nRemote pan, tilt and digital zoom\nLong battery life: 10 hours on power-saving mode, 6 hours with screen on\nOne (1) Optical Zoom Lens included.
