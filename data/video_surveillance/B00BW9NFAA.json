This unit was inexpensive and has a lot of good reviews.When it got here i took it out of the box i was amazed at how lightweight it is and compact.I have a mixture of wired and wirless cameras ,I plugged all the cameras in and turned it on and there were all my cameras, great picture too.The only draw back is that the operaters manual is on cd so I have to have my lap top to work on the programing.all in all its a great deal and works flawlessly,and its much easier to connectto wiyh my kindle and iphone.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "dvr 8", "Author": "JustMe", "ReviewID": "RTIJJOV4Y3AI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "all great except i see ghost image scroll across screen on some cams.

I sprang the $29.95 for the fullproof guaranteed port forwarder, and guess what, this model is not even on the list.  Pff doesn't let you contact them by phone or email, only on forums, and it takes up to 48 hours to respond.  No customer friendly device here for sure. works great on pc, but I wouldn't have sprung for the smart phone one if that wasn't a requirement for me.  will probably return if PFF doesn't answer.  Will be upset I had to spend 30 more bucks if they do resolve it.", "Date": "May 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good value for the price.", "Author": "Joe Takayama", "ReviewID": "R12IYIHB8FM6SP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Would have liked a hard copy of a owners manual instead of disk.

The first worked fairly well, with some  minor glitches, for a little over a year, but, I had disreguarded the manufacturer's instructions and installed the unit in my attic. Not good. Too hot. 1 fried hard drive/hard drive controller later, I was in the market for a replacement. I went with Defender again, for the following reasons...1.) Reliability...the first unit would no doubt still be working, if I hadn't installed it in a hot, dusty environment. 2.) Familiarity...I am very familiar with the user interface and all of my cameras are Defender 420 lpi indoor/outdoor units that work well. The DVR arrived in a timely manner (actually 1 day BEFROE the first estimated delivery date!) and the delivery company slid thie box into a plastic bag, since it was raining. The box was in good shape, no dings, dents or other blemishes. I proceeded to connect all the power, camera, and LAN cables and was up & running in 5 minutes!", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice Unit For The Money", "Author": "David Chabot", "ReviewID": "R2X6UF8VECYAA3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The hardware for this unit seems to be fairly well built and comes with a 1 Tb hard drive for the same money as most units without a hard drive.  The software seems to be fairly easy to use and is pretty straight forward.  I installed the mobile app and set up my router to forward the correct port to the unit but it is not working yet.  I am sure it is something simple that I will figure out when i get a couple minutes to look at it.  The software is running, it is just having trouble connecting to the unit.  All in all I would say it is a very good buy if you are looking for a unit that does everything you need, even selective motion detection, comes with a lot of features and a hard drive for a very reasonable price, this is the unit to purchase.", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great inexpensive system!", "Author": "Mike Miller", "ReviewID": "R18M4YQ1W10JT2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This has been a really great inexpensive system we have been using for a while now.
