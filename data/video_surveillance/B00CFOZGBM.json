{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Overpriced, cameras aren't very good, DVR is ok.", "Author": "Jason Cox", "ReviewID": "R28YZWA0P1WNFK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I professionally install DVR Camera systems and was tasked with installing this system in a residence. I opted to run the cables through the attic to two corners of the house and mount the cameras under the eave. The DVR box is ok, and is easy to install and setup. The power adapter for the cameras is sufficient and doesn't require mounting a box. The 500gb hard drive is also sufficient for most homeowner needs.The cables were long enough to reach one corner of the house, but not the other. 100 ft cables are usually needed to get from one end of a house to the other, so if you plan on not mounting the DVR in a central location, go ahead and buy how ever many 100ft cables you need, with BNC connectors at both ends. The cameras in this kit use BNC, not RCA like some other kits.The camera mounts are ugly, plain metal with ball joints that are easy to mount with a philips screwdriver and a 10mm wrench for tightening the middle nut. They are NOT capable of hiding the cable under the mount so you will have cable showing wherever you install. This makes it easy for someone to just grab the cable and unplug the power, disabling the camera. If you want to hide the connectors you will have to plug the hole that you run the cable through with a rubber insert or foam.The camera signal is ok during the day, but at night under poor lighting you wont be able to see much unless the camera is close enough to it to illuminate it with IR. That's about 5-10 feet. Anything beyond that under poor lighting will not be able to be seen.The system menus were fairly intuitive and easy to set up. The networking was a bit more difficult, and I had to download a manual from the KGuard website to get it going on the LAN, which let me view the camera and settings from a computer connected to the same router. I was NOT able to get port forwarding to work so I could not test the DDNS system.Overall the install was easy, but not as clean as I'd have liked due to the camera mounts being flat and unable to hide the cables. This is a little overpriced, and I've seen better kits sold on Amazon for less. I would suggest buying a different system unless this kit is priced well below $200.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$259.99", "Features": "Motion detection with instant email notification^Free Kview series allows remote monitoring and control on your smartphones and tablets^8 Channels & H.264 compression latest recording technology; pre-recording feature allows additional images to be captured prior to the motion detected event^Waterproof case to protect the camera and weather resistant^Quick Do-It-Yourself installation\nMotion detection with instant email notification\nFree Kview series allows remote monitoring and control on your smartphones and tablets\n8 Channels & H.264 compression latest recording technology; pre-recording feature allows additional images to be captured prior to the motion detected event\nWaterproof case to protect the camera and weather resistant\nQuick Do-It-Yourself installation", "Name": "KGUARD SecurityInc.
