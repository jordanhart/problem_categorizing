{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Camera.. Better picture than the competition", "Author": "dcg \"dcg\"", "ReviewID": "R2HNWGPK6YCRPT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I own one H216W and two Foscam FI8905W.Both are \"outdoor\" cameras that have relatively narrow fields of vision.I'm running my H216W off of a 60W solar panel that charges a 12V battery for power overnight.Highlights of the H216W:1) It's 12V vs Fosams 5V.  This really doesn't make a difference unless you're trying to power with a DC battery.  The Foscam pulls 2 amps at 5V, which tends to make the DC power supplies short lived and warm.  The Dericam power supply is under 1A at 12v.  Power supplies run cool.2) The image quality of the H216W is higher than the FI8905W.  True, the H216W has better resolution, but both my FI8905Ws have focus issues.3) The H216W has a  wider field of vision, 65 degrees versus the FI8905Ws 30 degree angle.4) Both have replacement lenses that can adjust the field of vision, but apparently the Foscam requires significant modification to take wider lenses.  You have to remove the main board to get access to the lens.5) IR illumination on the Foscam is better.  The Dericam illuminates well in the center, but not at the edges.6) Support is better with Foscam, but only if you buy directly.  If you don't buy directly Foscam may not provide support.7) Ease of setup is about the same with both - you'll need to understand basic networking8) Software is typical quasi-translated and functional.  Just don't expect any polish.I've enclosed pictures versus the Foscam outdoor IP camera.Note, the H216W draws right at .5A with the IR lighting off.Long term review:One Dead after 7 months.  Powers up, ethernet lights stay solid.  I requested warranty support (expecting to have to foot the bill back to China), but instead what I got was indirect support through my provider and no direct communication with the Dericam.  My posts to the manufacturer forum and direct emails were ignored.Troubleshooting involved disassembling the camera (without detailed instructions, reconfiguring my home network to be on the 192.168.1.x subnet, reconfiguration of my PCs IP address (to make it a default-call-home target), hardwiring the camera, and the ability to monitor a dhcp server.  I could get to the camera, but it would only stay up for about 10 seconds and the debug seemed to surround writing new firmware in that window.  After 4-5 hours of this over multiple days, I refused to do any more.  They're shipping me a new main-board instead... We'll see how that goes.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EI1WAUA"}}
