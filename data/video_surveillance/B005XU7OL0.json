The package came really fast.  I chose to hang it on the corner of my house I built a corner bracket to mount it. Looking at the construction I saw what other reviewers were talking about so I didn't take any chances even though it is under an eave. I put a little silicon around the top seam and drilled a weep hole in the globe to let out any water that may get in side. As far as mounting the camera inside there was no mounting hardware that came with the housing just a metal plate that mounts in the housing. if the camera is mounted flat on the plate you will not see much. the way I fixed that was to use a 1/4-20 x 4 toggle bolt with a nut on the other side to put the camera as close to the globe as possible, this worked out quite well. now as far as the infrared  illumination the camera has  with the globe on is useless. but that is not the fault of the housing maker. All I can do is turn off the infrared unfortunately that makes the foscam cameras useless at night.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Dome Enclosure", "Author": "Richard Boyd", "ReviewID": "R1GF7IZOHWU0ZK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this unit up on my garage for about a year now, with a Foscam pan-&-tilt camera inside it. The camera has been safe and secure inside, and sees the surveillance area with perfect clarity. The enclosure has protected the camera from high winds, rain and hail, snow, and extreme subzero and 100+ degree temperatures. It stays clean and dry inside the dome. It is made of plastic, but the base plate and the mounting plate inside are sturdy steel. It was easy to assemble and mount on the garage wall, as well mount the camera inside.Tip: You might want to get a couple IR illumination flood lights for using this enclosure with a Foscam camera or one of the many knock-offs of Foscam. I had to put up a couple IR illumination flood lights to illuminate the area at night, because the IR lights on the camera reflect off the inside of the dome and must be turned off.

And to my surprise, it works so well so far. But question is that it is an indoor camera that is not weatherproof, so I have to buy a cover to protect it as I place it outside. So I purchased this dome encloser. The decision I made is definitely a good one, for there are so many winter storms later. The CXS2200 fits it so well and this encloser does a great job. It works so good in the day-time, allow the camera to record the crystal- clear picture. But it will reflect the IR from the camera and that really affect the definition of the record picture. Though it has stated in its description on the Amazon and some guys have written a review about that, I didn\u2019t expect that it would turn out like this. When it gets dark I am seeing glare spots which make the camera image worthless and the reflections are coming from inside the dome. And no matter how I adjust the position the reflections remained stable relative to the camera view. I tried many combinations of mode and brightness all without success. After several trying, I contact their customer service and received an answer that it\u2019s the normal phenomenon. So, it\u2019s a great dome cover if it can solve this problem.Update:I found a fantastic way to resolve it. That\u2019s use tennis ball to cover on the CXS2200 and reduce the IR reflection at night. And I have to say that it works great!Here\u2019s the DIY process: 1. Take a tennis ball and cut off its both sides 2. Use the knife to cut off a circle for the lens (a little circle which can see a little bit IR) 3. Cover it on the CXS2200.After doing this, it would not arise any glare spots in the night vision and everything works so great!!

I have mounted outside on my garage to see my driveway and the side of my home. One problem is that because the camera is equipped with infrared night vision a glare is produced within the plastic dome at night and does not allow you to see anything. So I removed the plastic dome and use it without. Its done great in rain or fog during the night. I am happy. I should have done more research on the IR reflection not the company's fault. I do see now where is reads...\"the dome case will reflect the IR light back to camera at night\".

Modifying this allows you to mount the camera, however the dome has to be totally disassembled, and even then it is a challenge to get the camera level once it is in there.Aside from a philips screwdriver, you will need a drill to make holes for the mount and very tiny hands to adjust the mount once it is in there.Sure wish we could find an alternative.", "Date": "April 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works fine", "Author": "D Clark", "ReviewID": "R2PO8HWH4N7E6H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Had it just over a year and haven't had any problems with water or even condensation; it is installed under my eaves though.

It lets the camera view very good during the day but at night time when you turn on your IR lights they reflect back into the camera.
