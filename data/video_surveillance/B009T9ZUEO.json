I took a chance on the price vs reviews and compared to the other types in the price range, this seemed to fair much better (esp vs the clock cam item!). So I hooked it up first on a HD flat screen with auto motion/screen adjust to test it and it was not good. However, when you hook it up to a CRT tube TV or computer monitor, it is fine! There is color, you can adjust the focus and the camera is comparable to a slightly larger cube of sugar. The best part is it comes with the constant power supply - plug in normal voltage AND a 9volt cord for true wireless placement. There is audio but the mics appear to be on the sides and it can be low so I wouldn't count on picking up low conversations unless closely mounted. I tested the range which I have a 2 floor 2300 sq ft colonial and I left the receiver in the south most guest room and took the wireless cam down to the north most living room..it was ok but had static and buzzing. Best compromise is if you want it on different floors, then setup in the room above/below the receiver and it works better. You can hook this up screen direct viewing or into a DVR/laptop/VCR as long as it has RCA inputs.Pros:- Dual power for wireless cam- Sugar cube sized- adjustable focus- color pic- has audio but limited performance- lightweight cam and receiver- PriceCons:- mediocre audio performance if any- very narrow range to fine tune- range subjective to your environment/house- does warm up some in use (not sure if I'm very concerned at that at this point)- Cannot be used on HD flat screens with auto adjusting screens without it being confused, it will flicker when camera signal spazzes- Wire points could use some reinforcing (I would silicone the base of the wires entering the cam to support/stiffen it)so it  decreases the chance of getting pulled outUPDATE: 10/10/2013 - Above is my original post - this is an update after a month or so of straight usage -I was repositioning my cameras because I wanted better angles and I hooked a separate DVR to the interior cams vs the exterior security cams. Holy Jesus I guess after some use these things really heat up! It was a good thing I didn't stuff them in plush animals or by curtains. The power connection point and the mini cam itself was actually pretty hot! Out of curiosity, I used my automotive infrared heat scanner. After about 20 min or so, the ac power connection point averaged about 116 degrees F and the camera itself was at 96 degrees F! I am not sure what to say about that, I'm shocked and I certainly am weary about leaving them unattended now. Perhaps I should count my blessings that i've used them for a month and my house didn't burn down? I can't say that I noted my wired cams getting this hot so I will check them when I can gain access to them but I unhooked these 2 cams for now. Thank god it was wireless so at least I didn't have to start yanking wires...still shockedFor what it's worth: Fact - it is still functioning despite the temperature, still has better picture than my swann wired cams, I will not install it by curtains or inside plush animals, I will not leave this on while away from home, the price of other wireless spy cams even in \"professional\" grade has about a 3 star rating give or take but they can run up to the hundreds. At 20 bucks a unit and it is still functioning, I will just find another part time usage since I can't return it. Maybe I will use it outdoor when the dog and kid are in the yard playing or something..2/9/2014: Question: has anyone tried a 5V power supply? I have seen similar online but a couple have a 5V power supply and I was wondering if that makes a difference. I had a 3V but it wasn't strong enough to give a proper signal, it was on but the signal power was useless to the point where I didn't get a steady pic in the same room. It seems it needs a decent amount of power for a good signal to send but I'm hoping perhaps if I find a good balance I may use this without it burning. I really need anoth cam in another part of the house where the nanny goes but trying to run wires to it is very complex.

Then when testing again, the receiver power supply failed. It took a while to figure that problem out. Basically, I had intermittent power at the receiver indicated by the red power LED. I finally looked at the LED on the power supply and realized that was the problem. (So I'm slow, you benefit my honesty.) Once I used another spare power supply that I had, I still could not get a picture on the TV. In checking out the camera end of the problem, I checked the power supply and found that not working. Once that was replaced, the picture came right in and worked great. I'm not returning it for these problems because I intend to power it from other sources anyway once the halloween props are installed, so no big issue for me. It's still a pretty good system for the cost.Updated 2Oct13:Okay, so October is here and my Halloween props are up. The camera worked pretty well for about 20 minutes, and then the picture started \"rolling\" horizontally. Those of us familiar with older TV's remember trying to adjust the hold knob on the back to stop the vertical rolling. It was annoying then and it's annoying now. The problem is that there isn't a knob on the back of this to adjust. I'm going to try opening the case on the receiver to see if there is an adjustment screw.

away from each other. The camera will transmit video and audio to the receiver that you can view on anything that uses RCA inputs.In the box is the 2.4GHz camera, two AC adapters (one 9 volt and another a 12 volt), a 9 volt battery adapter, 2.4GHz receiver and RCA male-to-male cables.The camera itself operates on a fixed 2.4GHz frequency. The receiver uses a tuning knob to adjust the receiver's frequency to match up with what frequency the camera is transmitting on. In terms of supplying power I've found the 12 volt adapter is best for the receiver and the 9 volt works for the camera. Either one however will operate between 9 and 12 volts.Now the camera does get warm in two places. The first is the camera's input power connector. I've noticed it is a little larger than a standard female DC connector. My guess is for there to be heat generated there that it has a built-in power resistor to help limit current/voltage to the camera to prevent it from damage. The other area is the camera itself. Most likely this is from the 2.4GHz transmitter and camera electronics inside the camera housing. I've handled other small cameras like this and they do get noticeably warm.Which now brings up the issue in the title: signal reception. All video transmitters are measured by their power output (in milliwatts (mW)). For a camera this small, it's obvious the power output is small (I'm guessing less than 10mW). Now 2.4GHz has a short wavelength when compared to something like 900MHz which is longer. So, if you had a transmitter on 900MHz and another on 2.4GHz with both having 10mW of power, the 900MHz one would have a signal that travels much farther (more range) but is more prone to interference hence why it uses 2.4GHz (FCC regulations also play a part in what can operate on what frequency).The other problem is the receiver. It uses a standard TV coaxial connection for its antenna. I would've liked to have seen a more standardized antenna connector for using high dbi gain antennas to improve reception. The antenna provided is pretty generic form receiving a signal. However, all this is what makes the product affordable.", "Date": "February 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Introductory item", "Author": "Damon", "ReviewID": "R2ZQLCSLZCKG4A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This item was used on a scaled RC tank to provide wireless vision.

This is for the cameraIt is possible to incorrectly connect the AC Adapters (if you did not know they were different, then you have a 50/50 chance of an incorrect configuration).My setup is near line-of-sight at approximately 40' and the resulting picture quality is very decent.  As with any wireless camera, the image quality is decent but there is a tiny bit of \"snow\" due to the fact that it is an analog transmission.  The image quality issue prevents using the camera for motion detection unless you are able to perform post processing on the image.  For the low price (< $25), the image is quite good.However, because it is an analog device, I am not sure if it is possible to have multiple active cameras as their frequencies may overlap and interfere with each other.
