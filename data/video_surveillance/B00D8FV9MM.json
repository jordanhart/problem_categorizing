The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because you cannot view the cameras on a Macbook. It works fine though my Ipad, my daughter's Iphone, and my Android phone....but not on a Macbook. This is due to lack of support of ActiveX.Other than that, it's a great product.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Cost benefit product.", "Author": "Mauricio Acosta", "ReviewID": "R1NI5O196US3Z8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Elegant presentation.

I called samsang they said I have to install this camaras close to lights which means u have no preference where you want to install it has to install close to light to get color result. I would recommend this camaras for outside only and when it gets evening time u would lose color and goes to balck and white. I am returning this one and will buy something different which does not go black and white till its all dark :)", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,099.99", "Features": "View from anywhere : Android, iPhone, iPad, Windows, Mac OS, H.264 compression for extended recording\n1 TB hard disk drive (SATA), Multiple search option (Time, Event, Back up, Motion search)\nAuto port forwarding with quick connect technology, HDMI outputs for convenient connection to HDTVs or monitors\nTrue Day & Night with ICR for perfect color reproduction, Night vision up to 82ft\nIP66 weather resistant outdoor ready, PTZ Supportable (PTZ Camera not included)", "Name": "Samsung SDS-P5080N 16 Channel DVR Security System 1 TB HDD 8 Box Cameras", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wf9TzIoNL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00D8FV9MM"}}
