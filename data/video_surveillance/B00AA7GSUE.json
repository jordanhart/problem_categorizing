{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works Great", "Author": "Donald Durand", "ReviewID": "R375DCMNZ0O7FH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera. Was somewhat easy to setup (I work in the computer field). May be a little harder for a novice to setup, but if they get detailed instructions from website it should be easier. The video is very impressive (with an AMD Radeon with 256MB), just make sure you have a good video card (my laptop has an Intel video with 64MB and the video isn't that great).Before installing, go to the manufacturers website and download the updated software (setup/searcher, viewer and manual). Beware, there are 2 websites (a .net and a .com). Make sure you go to the .com. The .net is either fake or some other company. You will not find this camera on the .net site.One more thing. If you buy another model make sure it is a model from the .com manufacturer (the .net site has similar cameras with similar model numbers).For outdoor use search YouTube for making your own acrylic dome, not hard.I will be buying another 3 cameras soon.", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00AA7GSUE"}}
