The ease of use was a pleasant surprise and performance was outstanding especially for the cost. I installed a one terabyte hard drive so even with sixteen cameras it will record for many days without rolling over. Also the tech support guy was very helpful and friendly. Overall I like this unit very much.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a bad unit for the money", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3J9YWGYCSA3Z9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all.  The manual on the included disk is incorrect.  The Android app needed for cell phone viewing is called \"SuperLivePro\" made by Peng Antai.  It says this on the Aposonic website.The Android APP is the best part about this DVR.  Unlike the others I have owned, I can go through what it has recorded in the past directly from the APP.This is my fourth DVR in five years for my CCTV system.  With this one, I finally found one that I really like.  I installed a Western Digital Green 2 terabyte hard drive in it.  The instructions were a little vague on how to mount the hard drive into the case.  I expected it to use rails like other DVR's.  But this one is much more simple than that.  The mounting screws go up through the bottom of the DVR case and screw directly into the holes along the bottom side of the hard drive.As one can expect with these Chinese DVR's, setup can be a headache.  The instructions are English that was poorly translated from Chinese.  The menu system in the DVR is done in a similar manner.  I still don't know what some of the stuff in the menu and instructions does or means.  This is my fourth time setting up one of these things and it still took me three hours of trial and error plugging in different bits of info to get all of the features working properly.Overall, I recommend it.  It does have a steep learning curve if you are new to these things.  But only because the instructions are hard to decipher.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$239.99", "Features": "D1/Half D1/CIF real-time auto-adjusted Recording and Playback.
