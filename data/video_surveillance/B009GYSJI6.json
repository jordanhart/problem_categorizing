The KaiCong site is all in Chinese, and I haven't tried to use their \".info\" login or get an email.The camera is good enough picture for most purposes.  Pan and tilt seem very quiet, and pretty smooth.I don't care much about the color quality, but it seems ok.  There's definitely a bug in the interface for displaying contrast.  It will show \"1\", but is actually probably set at \"11\", or something else.Resolution is definitely 640x480 or less.I'm going to use this as a security camera, maybe an RV backup camera.  It should work well for those purposes.These run off a 5-volt supply, so connecting them to a 12v-to-5v converter should be easy.Other reviews gave enough clues for me to get it working.  Here's the sequence I used:1. Plug it in to your router with an ethernet cable and power it up.2. Go to your router's login page and find the network client list.  Two new MAC addresses should be seen, one for the wired interface and one for the wireless.  They were 1 digit apart in my case, for example, 00:A0:A0:10:02:02 and 00:A0:A0:10:02:03.3. Open a browser page at the address given for the first MAC address, port 81.  In my case, 192.168.1.45:81.4. This should present you with a pop-up asking for a username and password. \"The server says: GoAhead.\"5. Log in with \"admin\" and \"123456\".  Now see a splash screen with choices: \"ActiveX Mode(For IE Browser)\", \"Server Push Mode (For FireFox, Google Browser)\" and \"Mobile Phone (For Browser that supports Javascript)\".6. I chose Push mode, being on Chrome.  This opened the server page in the camera.  Now I can pan, tilt, adjust, etc.7. In the bottom right corner is a little gear icon, that pops up the word \"Options\" when hovering over it.  Click on it.8. Now the \"IP Camera Options\" page is displayed.  Here are various options to play with. Recommended is to change the login.To set up the wireless:1. After following the above, select \"Wireless LAN Settings\".  See the configuration screen.2. Select \"Using Wireless LAN\".3. Enter your router's SSID in the SSID field.4. Choose \"Infra\".5. Select the correct Authentication Type.6. Enter the router's password in the \"Share Key\" field.7. Click \"Select\".  This will reboot the camera.8. Disconnect the ethernet cable from the camera while it is rebooting, if you like.9. Now open a page in your browser on the URL as above.  You should now be connected wirelessly to the camera through your router.My Android Xoom and Samsung S4, both running Chrome are able to access the camera's server page and manipulate the camera.  I've had some success with the Android app \"tinyCam Monitor\", though its not perfect.  Still playing with it.In the router, it has been suggested to set the MAC addresses to static IPs, so they are not reassigned to new URLs.  That's a very good idea.Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with this purchase, and will probably get a few more.

Great deal for $33 with Prime.  The box and the instructions are pretty much all in Chinese, but the web interface is the standard one that you'd expect if you have bought other similar cameras before, and defaults to all English.I won't go into how to set it up -- there are many reviews of other cameras (like the $37 easyN camera) explaining that -- basically don't install any software on your computer...  plug the ethernet cable into your router, plug in the camera, then log into your router to see what address it was given, then you can connect directly from your web browser (port 81) and configure it.There are no relays on the back.  It just has an audio port, an ethernet port, and the power in port, so you can't connect this one to an alarm system or use it to remotely trigger electric door locks, etc.In order to get motion detection to work (via email), I had to turn on the scheduler (just set to \"all on\"). This camera only sends one snapshot per motion detect, rather than 6 like the EasyN does.Additionally, if you use CamViewer for iOS, the resolution support is screwed up. No matter what you set it to in CamViewer, these cameras will drop to 320x240. If you want to get it back to 640x480, you will have to go into the camera with a web browser and set it there (can be on your iOS device, doesn't need to be a computer).

WithMark's information it wasn't hard to get the camera working.  I did try using the######.kaicong.info DDNS site to see the camera over the internet and it works forme.  I've also used the browser on my android tablet and Kaicong's android app.But I have not been able to see the camera video over the internet, only while onmy local home network.  I have done extensive testing and troubleshooting, but novideo over the web, even though I have used 3 different port testers to ensure thatthe required port 81 is open in my router.I tried the Foscam MJPEG client 1.4.14 software but it does not work with thiscamera.Don't actually try to go to 123456.kaicong.info!  You MUST change the 123456 to thesix digit number on the sticker on the box and on the bottom of the camera.The info for/about the camera says \"upgrade firmware will be published regularly inKaiCong official forum, all free\" - but that site is all in chinese and doesn'toffer any other languages.  Google's Chrome browser translates some sites for me,but not a bit of this one.  So I doubt there will be any firmware upgrades.I have had a few times in the first couple of days when the camera stoppedresponding (on the wifi network) and rebooted itself.  And a few where it stoppedresponding and I might not have waited long enough and cycled its power to rebootit.  Since then it seems to have been OK.In the process of working on port forwarding and setting a DMZ in my router, Irestarted the router.  So it got a new WAN (external) IP address.  And now thecamera is having trouble connecting to its DDNS server.  So now using the\"######.kaicong.info\" address routes to my old external IP address and fails toconnect to my camera.  I have rebooted the camera a few times, but I'll try itagain just in case.Nobody else so far has mentioned that there is a focusing adjustment ring aroundthe lens.  I read about that in a review of another camera and checked mine.  Itdoes have a focus adjustment.The less expensive models like this have no IR-cut filter and colors are notaccurate.  In particular, green shows up as purple or brown.  But the camera doesgive a good picture even in very low light, well before sunrise or after sunset.The sensitivity and poor color may not matter much because it's intended for indooruse anyway, to be able to monitor even a dark room.For the price, I would definitely recommend the camera - with the warning that itdoesn't come with any information (in English) to set it up, and only if you don'tneed to see it over the internet..

For this one the price goes up before I brought it, after so many so so reviews.The price is good enough for me to move from my analog wireless system. The resolution is 4:3 DVD quality. The images have about full resolution in daylight and reduced (blurred) in the dark, typical of cmos cams. The image is much better than analog and you can install as much cam as you like without bandwidth, tuning and interference problems. The color is off (trees tends to be purple) but it's the same type of low cost cmos for cams with night vision, but without automatically on daylight filter. The night vision is pretty good that could be really have an 8 meter range - my lawn appears to be lit by a flash light beam. If you want to use the cam as anything else but a security cam you will be disappointed. The color is off and image quality much worse at night.I use it as a fixed angle security cam. I can't afford to moonlight as a security guard for my own home. So the pan and tilt is useless to me. The cam served html screwed up IE on Windows 7 and XP. Firefox and Chrome works on Linux, but I can't stop the tilt and pan motions on time to point the cam at the right angle. See trouble shooting below. If you want to scare people by panning and tilting and rotating the cam for the full range, it's impressive. But after that there's no way you can point to the desired angle with the bundled cam software. It's the same thing on browsers or on Android with touch interface. Worse, if you touch the screen by accident, the cam may pan all the way until it sees the wall.I would think with software pan & tilt, you can aim at the perfect angle easily. But not for this one. I have to look up the net below. However, the cam can memorize dozens of single pan&tilt; positions. The problems were, there's no easy way to move the cam by bundled software to where you want in the first place. Then, without activex, I can set the positions on my browsers but cannot move (call) to the positions.  If there are cheaper ones without pan&tilt; and with night vision, I'll certainly go for them instead.It's the same thing - I do not need the mic or speaker. Though the mic picked up sound on the Iseeu Android app. Since the Activex downloaded is actually for EasyN, I think this cam is somewhat EasyN compatible.There are several options for the images. Recording to hard drive from browser didn't work for me. I do not use Windows nor IE. You can send the images to an ftp server on schedule. There are 3rd party security cam apps to grab the images on schedule and store. With motion detection armed, you can sent a single image to email or ftp once triggered.Motion detection is very limiting for outdoor use, with moving cars and moving tree branches. I think a free ftp server installed on an old Android phone is best. An Android TV box may work and I just happened to have an Android stick computer attached to the TV. An image is about 40 KB (probably a lot smaller if you just need to watch your tarmac). You can store a week's image with a few GB if you sent once every few seconds. If you pay a few dollars the security apps will override the old images automatically in cycles.You can \"call\" the cam to a fixed preset position after motion detection. But I don't see the point of it as a security cam. If you can \"call\" the cam to scan around up and down and sideways, you may be able to scare people and take lots of picture at lots of angles.As for the installation, the Chinese instructions is really a diversion. You just need a browser, perhaps better not IE, and you know how to setup wifi for your phone or portable. Whether you want it or not, the cam is setup up to use Kaicong as a kind of DDNS server. So the sticker box url 345xxxx.kaicong.info redirects to the cam ip and port no matter how you change it. So a default dynamic address will work as long as you view and operate the cam within your LAN. If you want to operate the cam from the internet, you need static internal addresses and setup up port forwarding so the requests will go through the firewall and send to the IP address of the cam.After a little bit of looking at the html, you can step the position of the cam better by typing on the browser:http://192.168.1.102:81/decoder_control.cgi?loginuse=admin&loginpas;=123456&command;=6&onestep;=1and bookmark it. There are some unused garbage in the original software. The command number is 0,2,4,6 or you can google for cam decoder_control.cgi  For trouble shooting, you can see the \"video\" stream with most browser by replacing decoder_control.cgi with videostream.cgi in the above http address. You can see a single image with snapshot.cgi.  Login info is optional and the cam will ask for it when needed. \"Compatible\" cams use the same names. Most 3rd party software use some simple html code to buffer these raw images so they don't flicker during update.If your wifi signal is poor, there will be all sorts of problems, and the cam seems to hang after a while. But it's typical of wifi clients. On a smartphone you can just turn the wifi off and on again to resync. You can switch off and on the cam or reboot the router.  These aren't options for a security cam so you must get a decent signal. With a decent sized antenna, the signal of the cam isn't at all weak, probably on par with portables and better than phones.I had a repeater already for wifi phone coverage. But with this I found out that the wifi signal can get very bad at parts of the day with disconnection and reconnection. I had to adjust the tx powers and antenna directions to get a stable 24/7 operation.If you have a good signal, the cam is capable of well over 20 fps at 640x480, probably 30. The junk part of the url that Kaicong send to the cam probably cause more problems for weak signals. The reason for that junk may be to make the url unique to defeat cache problems at some browsers or at the cam. 3rd party software such as tinycam for Android works rather well.When motion alarm is activated on the cam, you can get one picture for email, and about 10 pictures via ftp, with selectable timing between consecutive ones. The motion seems to take some time to arm after set.I actually got the 2nd one now. But it's wifi g only! I have two routers and tried n only mode to verify that. Also, the mic pick up some consistent clicking noise.

Picture quality is good with reasonable color rendering. (Some reviews have complained about the color but mine is fine.) Installation takes some effort. First, you HAVE to know how to access your router via a regular web browser. I used Chrome throughout the installation.)  For many routers the access is to type in 192.168.1.1. You should get prompted for an id and password (often admin 123456 or something like that.). Learn how to do this first. (and change the password to something other than the default).  Once into the router you need to find a table listing the current IP addresses/MAC addresses/client name, etc. For Cisco routers, look in Status/Local Network and click on DHCP Client Table.  Look at this BEFORE you start connecting  the webcam. Now, plug in the webcam to power and use the ethernet cable to connect the camera to the router.  (You need to do this even if you are going to eventually to have a wireless setup.) Now, go back to the router browser page with the DHCP table and you will see another entry. Note the 192.168.1.nnn new line and write down all the associated info. Next, you need to get some stuff off the Kaicong site.  Go to [bbsen.kaicongyun.com/index.php...], click on IP cameras (by admin) and select SIP1602 IP Camera Manual, then click on the pdf link mid page [...]. Now you have the English manual.  (This BBS has other info that can be useful.)  In the downloaded pdf manual (Page 5) is a link to [...Searchen.rar].  This is a  download of Kaicong interface software that looks at your router and finds the newly connected camera. Run this then highlight the camera and select Browse. Follow along in the manual. Now the Kaicong camera software will start. When making selections in this software you HAVE to select set prior to any action occurring.  Now you can setup the wireless option, Click on Options at the bottom right of the camera screen,then Wireless LAN settings, Using Wireless LAN, Enter your router SSID, choose Infra, Select the right Authentication type (WPA default usually), router password ins \"share Key field\" and click select. Disconnect the ethernet camera while it is rebooting. Look back at the router browser DHCP table again and there will be a new 'wireless' line. Type  the 192.168.1.nnn:81  (probably 81, but use whatever displays) associated with that wireless in your browser address line and hit enter. Ta-da...You should be connected wirelessly.

Cannady", "ReviewID": "R136DJMBLBOZKJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've ordered several of these kind of cameras before (Foscom clones) and once you've installed one you've done them all.  I like the controls, the activeX file installs perfectly on Windows 8, and typical settings found in others (FTP, alarm, etc).  What I found as a nice surprise is the ability to setup a local storage location (or network) that becomes a repository for captures images and videos.  The price makes it a potential 5 star product.HOWEVER, there is a really dangerous feature that is on by default.  The camera automatically ships with a DDNS entry connected to Kaicong's DDNS registration server.  This easily allows me to find the device by entering the URL listed on the camera, but also means that Kaicong is registering every camera to their DNS server when it leaves the factory in China.  Whenever I hear of stories of someone \"hacking\" these cameras in the news, this is exactly the reason this happens--there is a DDNS entry that leaves a hole in a home network and, therefore, exposed.  After gaining access to the configuration pages of your camera, the first thing done should be changing the password.  After doing this, clear all settings and set a port number of 1  (since it won't allow a blank number) to break the DDNS connection back to Kaicong's registration servers.Another concerning feature in relation to the DDNS entries is I was unable to change the primary DNS server IP address away from Google's default DNS server (8.8.8.8).With the instructions arriving in Mandarin Chinese, plus the above \"feature\" described, I can only recommend these cameras if you've had experience with setting them up before (instructions are useless), and are knowledgeable around configuring a SOHO network.  That being said, the price makes them a steal if you know what you're doing.EDIT::::I am returning these camera's as I discovered they are not supported by my Micasaverde.

As a result I've lowered my rating of this product to a two. As for the \"IR CUT\" feature described by the vendor in this comment thread...when I put my finger over the light sensor on the camera the IRs light up. When I remove it (in day light) the IRs go out. Either way my green grass is displayed with a purple tint.Original:1) The base plate that screws into the wall was missing.2) No software CD/DVD included!3) The KAICONG.NET website is down. Google translate indicates some kind of illegal software issue.After messing around with Google translate and the KAICONG.CC website I finally managed to get the IPCAMERASEARCH software downloaded and the 1602 configured for wireless use. Which lead me to the following:4) The color is off...my green grass shows up as purple.5) When trying to record from IE browser interface I am unable to setup anything about the local record path or file sizes and of course the record button does not work.6) When selected Lock to lock horizontal movement ends in 1 hour exactly.7) Cannot tell if this is all fixed in a firmware update and other software is available because the English language website is down.8) Listen and talk can be selected and both work but for talk you need to hook up to amplified speakers.I was able to download a free version of iSpy and it works enough so that I can record and playback the video which is in MP4 format. It spits out a video file every 15 minutes. My longest recording session so far is 12 hours. Night vision was not bad compared to some other cameras I've seen.9) I was able to get an app for my Vizio Android tablet which allows me to see video and move the camera about. I am having problems with multiple simultaneous access to the camera on my local network. I don't know if this is a camera issue.Since this camera will allow me to monitor/record activity in the yard and only cost $35 total I give it an OK rating.
