These worked MUCH better both ways. Because of the acoustic tube you can still hear with the ear that has the piece in it.

Good features and sound, wire's too short, cheesy clips.", "Author": "D L", "ReviewID": "R2D1BLTBPKUT4D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The design of these headsets intends for the user to place the mic/ push-to-talk button down a sleeve and attach the clip for the acoustic earpiece directly behind the neck in order to conceal the hollow coil from front and side view as much as possible.In order to accomplish this, the wire from the acoustic earpiece has to be long enough to reach from center-neck to about four inches beyond the wrist. In this way, the user activates the PTT button using thumb and forefinger and speaks into the cupped palm.Here is the near miss aspect of these units: The length of the wire from the earpiece to the PTT switch/mic is 24 inches. Twenty-four inches is almost laughably short for those who have arms longer than twenty inches. I don't know anyone, outside of children, who might have arms that short.After plugging these in and running the wires, it immediately became a matter of finding some appropriate microphone wire to use to splice in a 15\" section of wire to make these actually function as intended.Once that was done, the units were ready for use. Well, almost. The next thing that had to be done was to replace the little slippery plastic clothing clips with steel security-badge clips so the pieces would stay in place during actual use.Now we were ready. We found that the earpieces actually sounded better than the radio's speakers and the push-to-talk buttons were crisp and positive. The mic's have no wind shielding so users need to be advised that they need to speak across the mic instead of directly into them, and keep them a couple inches away from their mouths. Operated that way we obtained very good results.Too bad, for the want of a couple of dollars' worth of more wire and pro clips, these would be outstanding accessories. As they are now, they are somewhat of a starter kit waiting for final assembly.", "Date": "November 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Perfect Accessory for my 2-ways", "Author": "Dave Tomita", "ReviewID": "R35Z1GYB2Y366H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I decided to purchase the transparent headsets because I didn't want to look too obvious that I was wearing a headset.  The headset itself looks cheap and flimsy, but it has proven to be sturdy and put together well.

My only complaint is that the earpiece seems to be designed to fit in the right ear; if you put the earpiece in the left it has a tendancy to slip and rotate out of the ear every once in a while.

I had tried my friends headsets before, and they're good quality, but it hurts my ear after a while, (why I use headsets when I'm fishing (ice fishing mainly), I don't like when other people hear my conversations), I tried these, and oh my god, these are perfect.  The sound quality is amazing, like a perfect diamond, comfortable like a broken-in, leather recliner.  So easy to use (2year old could probably figure it out).  At first when you put it in your ear, it'll feel weird, but it's comfortable after about 10mins (for me) (it's just a tad uncomfortable at first, and you can still hear outta that ear quite easily for it being like an ear plug).  Some people may be wondering why I got these for airsoft as well.  Simply put, I HATE it when my position is given away because someone used the radio, and the wrong time (for me).  With headsets, I can hear my teammates, hear movement around me, and more importantly, hear my enemies radio call end sound.  The weird thing about these in my opinion, is the placement of the PTT button, but I'll get used to it soon enough.  A plus side of these being clear, perfect sound quality (as if the person was right next to you), you sometimes forget that your wearing it, and, sometimes, people don't even realize you've got a headset in use.  The mic is actually so clear, that I put it up to my small boombox, held the PTT button on it, and my friend could hear EVERYTHING on the other headset.Pros:EVERYTHINGCons:Sometimes you forget your wearing it and say something out loud forgetting to push the button (if you don't have the VOX setting available on your radio).5 - 5 stars on this FINE product.

The headset worked in both, but it would only work clearly with the LXT114. The older model (LXT110) would chirp while trying to transmit.

I wanted something that you could wear that was unobtrusive and was comfortable to use for long periods of time.  I ordered these and they are really very good performing headsets.  The acoustic tube in your ear is so comfortable that I actually forgot that I was wearing it.  I was shocked at how good the sound is and it is actually much better than using the speakers.  The control works great and allows you to use the PTT button in a hand held situation or wear it on your collar.Plugging in the headsets into the G-11 makes adjusting the volume /on/off knob hard to turn but that situation is workable.  I am a big tall guy and the control/microphone can be ran down your sleeve and clipped to your cuff.  My dress shirts are 36 inch long sleeves and cuffs (or longer in some shirts) and the wire is too short to work comfortably going down my sleeve.  I am going to have to splice the wires if I want to use them in that mode.The VOX works but whichever person pushes the button and releases it has control of the VOX until the other radio has its button pushed.  I prefer just using the PTT mode and they work fine.  I saw some complaints about plastic collar clips but mine are made of sturdy metal and work just great.Overall I can only highly recommend these to you.  The voice transmission is loud and clear while also being discrete. You can even hear whispered messages clearly which was impossible when using the two way radio speakers.

When it's cold out, all the more reason not to pull off the gloves and go digging for your radio - so these babies sure did help.

Probably could have brought the sensitivity down one level to help out, but decided to switch to push to talk mode instead.  This worked out great with the button fairly easy to push with gloves on with the mic clipped onto our jacket collars right in front of our mouths.  Worked great for our needs.  Next, I'll try it out while on bicycles and may give the VOX feature another go... always miss out on chatting with my girlfriend while we're pedaling about.  Oh, and I'll probably give it a try next time I head out to paintball with friends.The ear bud was comfortable after doing some minor adjustments and determining that they don't have to be placed very deep in the ear canal at all.

The earpiece itself is as comfortable as any bluetooth earpiece I've ever used, though it does get uncomfortable after long periods if you don't get it situated just right (not unexpected). The clear plastic part is very professional-looking if the wires are run a certain way. The earpiece stays in place fairly well even through moderate physical activity, but starts to slip easily with perspiration.The sound quality is excellent and met all of my expectations, though I was a little disappointed by the lack of a volume boost for use in noisy environments (such as a dance club where I do security). The microphone is okay, but not great. In quiet environments, it operates as expected. With a lot of background noise, mic transmissions quickly become distorted and you have to practically swallow the mic to get your message out.The length of the ear-to-mic wire isn't quite long enough to allow versatility in how you want to wire it (as some reviewers said, it can't usually be wired near your wrist unless the wearer is exceptionally short of stature, for example). The mic-to-radio wire is long enough to wear the radio almost anywhere on your belt without risking limited mobility or accidental disconnection.The durability of the coiled part of the plastic earpiece is unimpressive. After about 60 hours of use over the course of a few weeks, the coiled part has started to lose some of its elasticity (it stretches but doesn't readily return to its fully-coiled state). I fear that the same may be true with the over-ear loop, which seems to best fit in the right ear, and sticks out a little too much from the left ear.Overall, this is a must-have for the Midland GXT1000, primarily because the included boom headsets stink on ice.

My friends and I use them for crew work for our high school's theater productions.  In the past, we used to have to text each other, or run around to tell each other things.  Texting didn't quite work since it took a while, and since we were in the middle of a concrete & brick building, reception wasn't too good.  Running around was tiring, and sometimes you didn't have the time to do such, especially if it was in the middle of a show.  Now with these, in partnership with the LXT118 radios, we're able to run our shows much more smoother and better.  Whether it be light and sound cues, set changes, or simply just chatting - these work great.  Clear sound and everything.The only reason that I'm not giving it 4 stars is because of the length of the cables.  I clip the microphone onto the top of my collar, and to be able to have the wires hidden from plain sight, as well as having the earpiece running down the side of the head and down to the back of your neck, I would have to do an awkward stretch of running the wire from the microphone, around my waist, and then up my back.  It would just barely be under my armpit.  Being a fidgety person myself, it wasn't too much of an issue once you got it hooked up, and even hooking it up wasn't too bad.  Another slightly annoying thing was that it kept coming off of the top of my ear (the tube would), and I would keep pulling it out.  Then again - I do wear glasses - but still.

Two way Radio it is.The Midland Radio's were fine and met our expectations however the APVH3 left much to be desired:On the receiving end (the ear piece) it was comparable to what comes with the Midland radios (why did I buy the extra?)

You can't be heard if you have the microphone clipped to your shirt or lapel. We have six of these in our group and all have the same transmission problems with very weak pick-up. That said given the other options for the price it works as long as you put the microphone next to your lips. The ear piece is very comfortable but can dislodge itself if the cord is bumped or pulled when mounting your gun. This can be easily solved by picking up some Macks ear plugs, the inexpensive, wax type used for swimming. Place the mic plug in your ear and then cover it up with the wax.

You pretty much have to put the mic in your mouth in order for the other people to hear you. I ordered these thinking they would work well and I was correct. It is very versatile and attaches to your shirt very securely. However I noticed a lot of people complaining that they do not reach to their wrist and that is because they are not made to, they are designed to clip on your collar or button. I use the PTT function instead of VOX due to the fact that VOX activates when you talk, therefor when you are talking to someone your radio will activate and everyone else will hear what you are saying, so I prefer the PTT function instead. You can hear every word very well and you don't have to put the mic right up to your mouth either which is nice,they also are discrete and very professional looking. However, I have noticed after wearing them for a long period of time they start to hurt your ear and make it sore. I usually take it just out of my ear and turn it up a notch and I can still hear it very well. Overall I am very satisfied with this product.
