{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great product, but has a few issues.", "Author": "frink", "ReviewID": "R8VDLHG6QQFQT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall I am very happy with this product, but there are three major flaws I would like to highlight.1) Audio camera buzzes loudly with interference. I would think a line that is expected to traverse wall cavities would be properly shielded.2) The camera's notched mast attachment to the mounts break within 5 seconds. The machine-thumb screws are not long enough, and there should be a nut on the end of it to prevent the assembly from falling apart. It is an easy fix to obtain the right longer machine screws from Home Depot but the manufacturer should not require us to do this.3) The app to view the DVR via Internet Explorer doesn't work without me adjusting the resolution on my laptop down and back up again. Not sure if this is the manufacturer, or Microsoft, or ActiveX or whatever, but it just doesn't work without doing this.12/16/13 - Quick update after 2 months & a season change, the system continues to operate as designed, there have been no problems with the cameras operating outside through minor snowstorms and 15 degree nights. The DVR continues to function as designed.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera system", "Author": "David T.", "ReviewID": "R20GBBA0SAW8OJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "System was fairly easy to setup.  I am very happy with it. The cameras produce a very clear picture during the day.  At night, the picture is reasonable.  The DVR software is easy and have some neat features like it can send you an email if motion is detected in a certain part of the picture.  If I had to complain about something, it would be the camera's field of view.  For a surveillance system, it seems kind of narrow.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$429.99", "Features": "Night Owl 8Channel 960H 500GB DVR Security System", "Name": "Night Owl Pro-84500 Video Surveillance System", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VXduX0IzL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DZTGDTK"}}
