For the price and ease of set up it's a winner hands down and would recommend this to anyone.That longest part of the install was running the wires. Entire hardware hook up to monitoring took me 4 hours for 6 cameras( I have two extras Muahh haaa haaa). Everything is simple where as you just run the wires, plug everything in and you're done.As for setting up remote viewing I wanted to be able to see all my cameras via my iPhone and any browser. The directions that come with setting up remote capabilities are really bad, basically useless. With a quick search I found the below link which I was able to follow and configure the system in about 15 minutes.http://kb.zmodo.com/NetworkTutorial/landingpage.htmlClarity is good both during the day and at night. Colors are a little saturated but that's being over picky because it's the only thing I can pick on with this unit. Night vision is good. I have one camera pointed at my shed in my back yard which is 30 yards away and I can clearly see everything in total darkness. I have others across my front, back and side yards which I can clearly see everything at night. I was very surprised how well the night vision works.The ability to have emails sent to you when motion is detected is nice. I wouldn't set it up with any external camera facing a road or any place where there would be a lot of traffic in front of the camera because it will send you a message every time a car drives by or any motion is detected.Great unit for the price, Everything worked perfectly first time through, super simple hardware and remote viewing setup.
