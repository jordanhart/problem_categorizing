I wanted to monitor the camera on my iPad. The Phantom quadcopter went out of control and crashed into my neighbor's arm giving him a rather deep cut. I tried flying again, and the Phantom quadcopter went out of control and flew away. I searched in the direction it went using my iPad to try and get a signal from the GoPro Wi-Fi, but I never found it. It may have flown far away; I don't know where it went. I lost both camera and quadcopter and my neighbor is mad at me.There is no warning on the Phantom box. No operating manual came with the product. I used the operating instructions I found on the dji company web site. There is no warning on that web site that I can see. After I lost my camera and quadcopter, I did find a small warning on the B&H; Photo web site.The B&H; Photo web site warning says: Warning: Never use the DJI Phantom Quadcopter with your GoPro camera when both devices have their Wi-Fi systems turned on. The DJI Phantom's Wi-Fi and the GoPro camera's Wi-Fi run on the same frequency, so if you use them together when both Wi-Fi systems are engaged, the DJI Phantom's transmitter will lose the ability to communicate with the DJI Phantom Quadcopter. Whenever this happens, you will not be able to tell the Phantom where to fly. This may result in loss of property or damage to your equipment.It would be a nice product if they sent proper operating instructions and warnings.", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a toy", "Author": "joe1", "ReviewID": "R3SXOWS73IKDMN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent entry level product, I'm mainly a GoPro user and was looking into getting a quad last year to film with, but at the time the system I was looking at was too expensive to consider.

Ward \"mjward\"", "ReviewID": "R3JSSFZXMMSPGK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this Phantom package three weeks ago and have flown it numerous times everyday since. I have not had one issue with this quad copter and find it to be great fun and and excellent value.DJI, the company that makes this quad, has links to their very well produced videos on nearly every aspect of the quad. The videos are well worth the time to view while you await delivery. If this is a first time buy for you allow me to recommend your considering adding to the order, or any of these packages that already include, extras such as batteries, props and blade guards. An extra charger won't hurt either.This quad is quite remarkable in its sophistication of GPS and stability. One important note where I believe others have not heeded to the instructions is allowing the quad to set itself up upon power up. Wait for it to go through the entire startup as described by DJI and you will have trouble free flights. The quad does look at its compass and more importantly looks for satellites to be acquired for the GPS. I have noticed that if I launch from nearly the same location that startup is incredibly quick or disregard the GPS and fly \"manually\". Your choice.One very important note: if your are going to use a sports cam with the Phantom TURN OFF the WiFi in the cam as it may interfere with the control of the quad. This is noted by DJI though I have not had an issue when intentionally turned on as a test.That being said, using a sports cam to take videos of the flights is pretty awesome. I do not own any GoPros but use and prefer the Sony Action Cam with the tighter and brighter lensing but more importantly, image stabilization. The Phantom comes with a GoPro carrier but I was able to use a single strong rubber band to hold the Sony and have flown with it at least 20-30 times and have not had one incident other than pure pleasure of viewing the flights.Flight times for me have been 9-11 minutes with a payload of a camera attached and nearly 14 minutes without. Realize that windy conditions and your flying technique will vary the flying times. The stability of the quad in windy conditions does rely on ramping up and down the prop speeds and holds position very well and doesn't seem to draw too heavily on the battery.The quad comes fully calibrated and there has been no need to update this. After three weeks I updated the firmware and even after that the quad still was calibrated correctly. If you are the geeky type wanting to calibrate the quad or update the firmware be aware that DJI has only put out Windows compatible software. This should not stop you as Macs can run Windoze or do what I did, buy an under $300 Windows 8 laptop. If need be borrow a friend's as it truly is mere minutes to update firmware and/or calibrate the quad.Now I am looking forward to the Nov 2013 release of the Phantom Vision", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "100% Satisfied", "Author": "Ashli", "ReviewID": "R52QFBEJFNJC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the dji phantom for my husband.

The second time I simply watched the Quad fly away with my GoPro 2.Only twice in the time that I owned the Quad did I try to use the Go To Home feature both where when I had already lost control of the Quad, and turned off the Remote in hopes of it bringing it back, obviously it never worked for me.Do yourself a favor and purchase something less expensive, it will be great fun and should it fly away you won't feel as disappointed as I do.P.S. If you already own one I recommend that you install some type of noise maker in the Quad, either a loud buzzer that sounds every 30 seconds or some type of remotely controlled Bell or Chime. Because if you lose this thing in Farmers Fields or the Woods it is like looking for a needle in a hay stack, with some noise to follow I might have been able to find mine. Also it seems obvious now but I never put a phone number on the Quad in case someone honest found it, and wanted to return it, doh.", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "DJI Phantom - nice step up from small quads, not super stable for aerial video or photography", "Author": "CEGA", "ReviewID": "R24GT4OWAARYKA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought the Phantom to step up to a larger platform to do some aerial video and photography. Found that while the Phantom is capable of carrying the payload (GoPro HERO 3 Black mounted in Zenmuse H3-2D gymbal) in any conditions other than calm air it was difficult to get clean video, regardless of balanced props, motors etc.Still makes for a fun quad to fly and would definitely recommend getting proficient on this or a similar quad before moving up to a larger frame.", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent product, extremely fun and pretty easy to learn", "Author": "WhatsItToYa \"Marcus\"", "ReviewID": "RKABS7YUHTQT1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If this product doesn't make you extremely happy, you've got problems.My expectations are far surpassed. I ordered this product on 2-7-14 and received it a few days later. I can confirm this is version 1.1.1 (the newest version;  the version 1.2.1 is oddly the older version). The remote sticks self-center and there is a gimbal control on the back of the remote. This combo comes with two batteries, I recommend 3+ batteries.Assembly was easy, just attach landing gear, propellers, anti-jelly mount and you're ready to go. I highly suggest getting 3 batteries at least because 10-15 min flight time per battery FLIES by. This kit shipped with 2 batteries total, more propellers than i cared to count, the anti-jelly mount, cleaning cloth, and remote. I had very little RC experience (except those little cheesy $20 helicopters) and I got the hang of flying the  phantom within 5 minutes and I am continually get braver and braver. The \"Hover\" feature (when you let go of the sticks in GPS mode, it'll hover in position) is not as dead-accurate as I hoped, but its still pretty impressive. It'll slowly creep around a little bit in hover mode, but it holds its position fairly well. If you're headed towards a tree, just let go of the sticks and it'll slow down and hover; that saved mine a few times while learning to fly.For those, like myself, who have never flown an aircraft like this before and are not masters of the airplane language of pitch-roll-yaw, the 2 arms with the red stripes have red bright LED lights underneath, the other two have green. The \"nose\" direction in GPS mode is located between the two red LED arms. In GPS mode (the only mode I've used so far), the left stick is for altitude (up\\down) and \"spinning\\rotating\" the phantom (left\\right). The right stick is for \"banking\" (left = banks to left direction relative to the nose, etc). Like I said, best way to learn is to just jump in and fly it, even if its just 10' off the ground. I believe the easiest mode to fly in will be \"nose=always away\" (on the right joystick, up always makes it fly AWAY from its take-off point, regardless of \"nose\" direction). I have had a few crashes and many close calls, but I have never managed to flip it or wreck it in GPS mode, even though I tried haha. Its like the phantom has a self preservation urge. This being said, the phantom does not have eyes, so I'll tell you things it doesn't like: Chairs. Trees. Buildings. High speed landings. The side of my truck. Still haven't broken anything though, but I DO recommend the prop guards while learning to fly.My only serious dissatisfaction points are 2 things: 1st complain: I EASILY stripped an allen screw while putting on the prop guards. That was super fun to get out after being stripped....$500 aircraft with cheap screws ha......2nd complaint: Poor instructions.  I'm pretty computer savvy and mechanically skilled, and I had to read the instructions several times, watch online videos on DJI's website, manuals on the website, and STILL had to just jump in and start playing with it before I learned what was going on. I even tried to charge the batteries without result. The batteries have the standard positive and negative leads coming off of it, and also another set of wires\\connector. I figured the extra wires\\connector were for an accessory port for the battery. I \"charged\" all three batteries for 1.5 hours each the night I recieved the phantom, but they didn't charge. It wasnt until I Googled the manual for the charger that I realized the \"extra\" wires on the battery had to ALSO be hooked into the battery in addition to the standard positive\\negative leads that come on 99% of everything else in the world haha. I suppose the extra wires tell the charger what king of battery it is\\how to charge it.All in all, I am completely satisfied with spending this kind of money on a phantom. I have had no fly-away issues or threats. I would highly recommend one for the fun of flying it, not to mention the footage you can produce from an aerial point of view.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Everything came as advertised, version 1.1.1 latest version, A+", "Author": "Neil K \"Neil\"", "ReviewID": "R1LI6XTX55RQN5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As advertised, came with all pictured, it was luckily the latest version DJI Phantom, version 1.1.1 that has the gimbal tilt control and other features including updates radios, self tightening propellers, and a better Rx remote.

The customer service has been incredibly subpar, lacks courtesy, and are beyond uncaring.I had many issues with this company at the beginning, from delays to misinformation. I finally received my DJI Phantom today (9.3.13) only to find an apparent issue. After opening the box, adding the landing gear, etc, I quickly discovered the throttle on the controller does not work.In the tutorials offered by DJI, they illustrate that the throttle should be set to the off position/down facing. The controller provided does not lock the throttle in a downward position. The throttle on the left hand side sits loosely and does not appear to be set in any position.At this point, I am uncertain that I received a legitimate item from Kozaam. I reached out to DJI and was advised that only a handful authorized dealers exist in the USA. I am unable to find Kozaam in the list of only 12 authorized dealers in the USA. I am left to assume I have been sold a faulty product from an unauthorized company.I have contacted Kozaam and will post an update if needed.The DJI Phantom itself is an awesome piece of machinery and is a beautiful product.

This is not ready to fly, for starters you must assemble several pieces once it is out of the box, but that's acceptable. The problem really starts when you have to take it out for your first flight because before you go outside you must connect it to your PC and do a few tweaks like calibrate controller, calibrate compass, make sure the readings on the compass are good then go outside and calibrate it before the flight by turning 360 degrees horizontally and then vertically. A lot of times you calibrate it , but by the time you get to the park the compass is messed up again because it came in close contact with a cell phone, car speaker, computer, metal, or other electronic devices and if you are outside dying to fly your Phantom it won't calibrate and you won't be able to fly it. It happened to me several times and I have a special case to prevent such thing, but guess what it won't help much. This is an amazing concept that was released way before being actually ready for the market. There are stories of Flyaways, the lighting system to indicate problems is ridiculous, no power switch, and you have to power cycle this device all the time. IMHO a nice analogy is comparing it to current mobile Operational Systems. The Phantom is way more Android, virus and crash prone than to iOS or WP8. The device is very solid, the construction is very good, but the inner guts aren't and you'll have issues with the motors, the GPS, having to do a Voodoo prayer trying to calibrate the compass specially if trying to follow the instructions on the outdated videos posted by DJI, in which the software version is different than the latest one that you downloaded and you can't really determine if the values are correct.The day you realize you need support, you'll realize that DJI has absolutely none, I had an issue with mine and emailed them for support, the site said 48 hours for an answer, but it has been 5 days and nothing. I bought mine and it worked fine for 14 days until three of the motors stopped working out of the blue after an afternoon flying it with no accidents. I am returning it this Saturday, but before that I ordered a new one and for my surprise it was defective out of the box. I put it together and when I tried to turn the motors on to test three spin normally, but one spins weirdly in very slow speed making a strange metallic clicking noise. I am returning this one as well. This machines are made in China on top of a nice project, but maybe to make it mainstream they cut down costs here and there making it a not so much lovable machine.I have a LOVE & HATE relationship with it and am afraid I'll have to buy another one after putting close to two grand on additional accessories like FGPV, a handful of extra batteries, extra good quality multi-battery charger, protective case, gimbal, Hero Black and additional miscellaneous line carbon fiber vynil and etc. It is very tough for me to get out of it now, but for those of you who are really thinking about this platform, I'd think twice.", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "Amrom Kruman", "ReviewID": "R37KKD732Q0TCT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is so amazing.
