But the seller assured me it was made by Dahua and carried a warranty.It was a replacement for my Samsung DVR and was not hard to set up.  The recorded video looks better than those with my Samsung.  The recorded video looks to be higher resolution i.e. D1.  I have been using it in my surveillance camera system for over one month now and it has been working flawlessly.", "Date": "February 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008X8VANW"}}
