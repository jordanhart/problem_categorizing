This makes it a real pain to use because it will become a twisted tangled mess as soon as you start to unwind it.  The best method I found was to unwind it outside on the floor unrolling is so the two wires are laid down.  Next you have to pick one end and then manually unwind it from the other end as you spool it up.  Its a real pain to work with this cabling.  Most people probably want to fish the dvr end through a hole and have all the other cable - camera end all spooled up.  This cable is just not going to help you at all in this regard its a major pain.  It would help alot if the supplier either spooled it so the two end strands where not intertwined - or provided some kind of plastic widget thing to make unwinding less of a pain.

The only \"bad\" thing about these cables is that they are VERY THIN compared to the camera cables you get when you buy a camera/dvr system (The Swann 4 camera system I bought had much thicker, more sturdy cables). They all work great, but any animal or sharp corner will cut these cables for sure. I don't advise getting these IF YOUR CABLES ARE EXPOSED OUTSIDE. My cables however are immediately running into the house from the cameras, so not even an inch of cable is showing outside, therefore the thin cables aren't a problem for me. If you can be careful while running these cables and not end up cutting or splitting them, they work great! The video quality is the same for me as the cables that came with my system, so the thin-ness of these doesn't affect qulaity at all, you just have to be careful while running them. As with all camera cables (not just this brand), the point where they split into power and video at both ends WILL SPLIT VERYYYY EASILY...I suggest putting electrical tape around these points on each end of your cables before running them to prevent accidental damage (I split one of the 4 cables I had while simply unwinding the cable from the plastic spool they came on, they are that easy to split so follow this suggestion unless you want faulty cables!)
