One issue I wish I knew before purchasing.", "Author": "Andrew D Gardner", "ReviewID": "R2GBX6I9CVS634", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was pumped that when I received delivery, mine had an upgraded DVR to 4TB!  Night vision is incredible and is among the highest quality pictures I've seen.  The only thing I didn't realize when I purchased (although it's mentioned in the description) is that the 2 big cameras don't have cables to hook to the DVR. Had to purchase online separately which cost me an additional $120.", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great system, very little difficulty setting up remote viewing", "Author": "Keith Currier", "ReviewID": "R2W36ZM9RDU2Z8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I looked at a lot of systems and manufacturers befor settling on REVO. I was concerned that my ability to interface the DVR and my computer would be a problem based on numerouse comments online. However, it was really quite simple. The hardest part is selecting a location for the camera where you get the best coverage. I ran a cable from the DVR to the camera and taped tha camera to the wall/ceiling, as I doing this alone. Once the location of the camera was selected, running the wires through the hot Florida attic was a chore, but having both an access location for the DVR and snaking the wire into the eaves made the project easier.Once all cameras were plugged into the DVR, the LAN cable from the DVR connected to the router, and the DVR connected to a monitor, the setup program checks compatability and identifies ports, IP address, etc. Despite getting an affirmative response from the DVR, I was having trouble connecting to the website for remote viewing. One phone call to REVO, with a short wait time of approximately 5 minutes at 5:00 pm, and I was connected to Manny, who walked me through a program whereby he accessed my computer set all the parameters, and in the end told me that mu LAN cable, which was not new, was the problem, and to push the cables in again. Once that was done, I was up and running, although the Revo remote website is a little confusing, the manual is explicit and helpful.The cameras provide great daylight and evening pictures, the DVR was easy to setup, and thanks to Manny at Revo, the software setup was pretty easy. I just need to buy two more cameras, as it seems you can always find another angle to cover with an additional camera.Overall, I'm pleased with the system and the lifetime tech. support, and can not cite any cons at this time.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "All-in-all an excellent system", "Author": "Colin Povey \"cpovey\"", "ReviewID": "R3NPXT35JAG6J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had never bought a security system before my boss told me to research and buy one. Knew nothing about them. After doing a lot of research, I choose this Revo system. While it is not clearly stated is that the two larger cameras have zoom lenses. You zoom them at install, and unless you get a ladder out, they are then fixed. This is a great advantage of this system. We installed a total of 13 cameras, and 12 of the 13 came up the first time, while the remaining one had a simple wiring problem that was easily fixed. Setting up the remote monitoring was pretty easy.There are only two negatives about the system. One is that the six bullet cameras are only 600 TVL, and are less clear than 700 TVL cameras. The second is that the DVR has 6 Revo RJ-style connectors, and six BNC connectors, which are more universal but more expensive to deal with. I wish it had all one or the other style.If I had to do it all over again, I would purchase this system again.*************** Update ****************A few months after installation, the company that shares our building (we use 80%, and they have 20%) had someone walk in and steal a laptop computer!While I had never done this before, about 15 minutes of playing with the system, and a USB USB Thumb Drive, and I had found the image of the guy who stole the computer! I copied it one the thumb drive, and provided it to the police. Considering that before this installation, I had ZERO EXPERIENCE with any surveillance system, I think speaks well of the both the software and the manual with the product.Without question, I would highly recommend a REVO system to anyone.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works fine", "Author": "Yo", "ReviewID": "R2Y35TD5BGWKP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Customer service from revo leaves a lot to be desired.
