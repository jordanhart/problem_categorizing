{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Easy set up, images just OK, LAN connecton difficult", "Author": "S. Howe", "ReviewID": "R2A82OBGGCMCR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This unit is very easy to set up (other than running the cables through the attic etc) Everything on the unit is plug and play(except the LAN connection-more on that later)The cables are very cheaply made, and there is no monitor. The picture is OK but the price is good for 16 channels and 8 cameras. The DVD is quite noisy, you can hear the whine of the fans through the closet door, this could alert a thief to its location and he/she could steal the evidence.MORE DETAILS(and installation tips) The first task is trying to figure out where to put your cameras and get the coverage you want. I placed the unit on a cart with a monitor and one camera connected. I powered it from a long extension cord and mounted the camera to the end of a telscoping pool cleaning pole. Then with the help of my granddaughter I held the camera at likely spots and she pretended to be a thief accessing all doors and windows. Several camera locations were changed from my original ides due to this testing B4 we drilled any holes. I highly recomend doing this, it will save you disapointment and time re-doing your setup later. When drilling holes for the cables in the exterior, a 5/8\" hole is the smallest that you can drill and still get both connectors through it (one at a time). I drilled a hole for the cable at each camera location B4 mounting the camera, just be sure you can get a fishtape to each hole from the attic, crawl space etc. Mounting the cameras is easy once you know where to put them, screw the bracket on and mount the camera to the bracket. I put all mine up B4 the cable pulls so I would not forget the locations we determined and it gave the house the appearance of video survielance B4 I finished all the cable pulls, just tuck the cables into the hole that was drilled near the camera. I had also bought a few extra cables because of the length of some of my runs and the feedback I had read on these cheap cables. I did a side by side comparison of different cables while the unit was still on the cart, and only one produced a better picture than the others-See my review on that cable. I then had to run the cables from the closet where the DVD will be to the camera locations. Try not to run them beside electric wires because these cheap cables are NOT shielded and could pick up some interfearance. Also be carefull when fishing them through walls and floors because the conectors can pull off very easy (3 small conductors about 24 or 26 gauge- it shares the power common with the video common and they are not shielded) I had one connector get caught and pull off, Radio shack does not have the right size connectors to fix it properly. I wish I had researched more and found thicker cables that were NOT the siamese type.The harddrive was already installed, so set up was literally plug in the unit, Attach your own monitor and monitor cable(not provided) attach the camera cables to each port and plug in the small power supplies and splitters then plug in each power cable to them. Turn the unit on and you got survielance. Plan on spending some time fine tuning the mounting angle of each camera to get the best coverage. Day time pictures are OK, I can see nearly my entire porperty (about an acre)on all 4 sides of the house, but unless someone is close to the camera you cannot see facial features well enough to recognize them. Night time viewing is suprisingly good up close(B&W;), but I do not get anywhere near the distance advertised. I found that when my motion sensing flood lights come on I can then see very far as long as that area is lit. Note that while we cannot see the IR light produced by the LED's, if you look right at the camera at night you can see a slight red glow. Now the worst part, and why this only gets 3 stars. Connecting to a wired LAN network was very difficult. All I wanted was to view the cameras from other PC's in the house. The manual is very limited on this, support from Zmodo was non existant. After several days of reading, trying, tweaking, I got it to work, I could even adjust settings from my PC. Then something changed and I cannot access it anymore, have tried to solve it, but to no avail. There are many article on these system being a gateway for hackers to get on your LAN and Connecting to the web was not a desire of mine, so I read up on how to disable that on my router.
