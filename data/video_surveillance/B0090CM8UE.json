{"Reviews": [{"Title": "They could have included better cameras", "Author": "devillarin", "ReviewID": "R2QKIWEI76JH43", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Cables that come with the cameras are 60 feet, too short for my 2 floors house so I had to purchase four more 150 feet cables. Image quality between two cables are the same. The cameras that I install on the corner of the house at the second floor do not provide a good pictures, but the cameras that I install at the corner of the garage on the first floor are perfect. So I have to look for better cameras for the second floor. Installation was very easy, first I checked all cameras and cables then I started to install everything. The night vision is not very good, if it very dark the camera will not show much, but if there is a little light the cameras will show something black and white. Motion sensors are very good it is working O.K. The DVR have some problems, when I change the channels from 8 to 16 channel view it shows green lines with nothing on the screen, I have to turn off and then on the DVR to see everything again. DVR menu option is not easy to follow either.I have not been able to connect the system for online viewing, I have some problems with my Uverse and AT&T; support people, I need my port 80 to be open and it seems AT&T; support don't know what I am talking about. So I have not been able to make that part work yet. I have heard people using Comcast have easier time connecting their security system for online viewing.In short, the DVR has some problems (it could be only my DVR, I don't know), cameras do not have a big viewing range, if you install cameras on a one floor house they are perfect but 2 floors not so good. connecting the security for online viewing with ATT is a pain.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$569.99", "Features": "Indoor/ Outdoor\nRemote Access via Smartphone or PC\n1TB HDD Installed: 24/7 Record 8 Days\nEmail Alert when motion detected\nMotion detected, time shcheduled & continuous recording mode", "Name": "ZMODO 16CH CCTV DVR Security System with 16 Sony CCD Weatherproof Outdoor Bullet Cameras - 1TB Hard Drive", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uweQb0RtL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0090CM8UE"}}
