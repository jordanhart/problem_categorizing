The VT164 is an epic fail. I imagine at some point they decided to make sure that it was not going to be useful for serious or commercial use - so they removed the PoE feature: now you have to run a network cable and a power cable. Ugh. And if you already have BL-C series cameras? They won't integrate cleanly: you can't have a BL-C series multi-camera display, with one of the cameras being a VT164 (it will show up as a thumbnail, but clicking on it will give you an error 404). The supplied software forces you to install a Windows client to get multiple cameras. If you're only intending to use one camera, or if you're starting afresh and don't mind installing client software, this might meet your needs.

They also have H.264 video compression available that can help with throughput over motion JPEG.  However, there are some interesting features one should be aware of.First, the VP104 has a plastic lens cover/dome over the Pan/tilt ball.  The older style Pan/Tilt Panasonic cameras (like the BLC131) didn\u2019t have.  For many installations, this extra protection against dust and etc sound great.  However, I have found a couple of problems with this approach.  First, if the plastic lens cover get\u2019s scratched or has dirt or other stuff on it, portions of your image will be fuzzy or distorted.  Second, if you have a situation with bright side lighting hitting the plastic lens, you\u2019ll get all kinds of fogging and reflections especially at night.  I have glued on plastic \u201clight shields\u201d on the side of the camera to keep the bright light from hitting the plastic lens with some success.  I also wish the camera was all black to reduce reflections when placed behind a window looking outside.None of the cameras do very well in low light, but for the price, who can complain much.  Also, no optical zoom, just digital.  Since it has 720p resolution, when setup for 640x480 viewing, the digital zoom looks pretty good\u2026but then why do you buy a 720p camera for 640 viewing?  I have 5 cameras set up at home on my network (wired), they do just fine at around 5 or 10FPS to my NVR, getting them to run at 30fps hasn\u2019t been possible with all the other traffic on my network.  I also have not had much luck with the range of wireless from the two cameras that have WiFi built in.  Again, it\u2019s probably from all the wireless gear I have at home!  A dedicated wired network for IP cameras only, would be a good solution to eliminate much of the contention.

I use the Blue Iris software to run it, so didn't use the built-in web site more than just configuring it and making sure it works.Blue Iris does the motion capture, alerts, emails and all, as well as provides the streams that I use on my phone.The quality is good.

The menu for this camera is very different from other Panasonics I have and seems to be less intuitive and in some ways not as generally useful as previous units.  The only way I could get an image attachment to an email was to have it triggered by an alarm event which can not as well be controled as a timed event or one of a fixed duration.  I could get scheduled images to my server but no scheduled images to email. I would hope that a firmware update would offer an improvement. I also noted that multiple screens to other panasonic cameras can be set up but the other cameras could not see this one in multiple camera views.  This camera is probably more like a security camera than a general purpose webcam. I still might buy another since my older units of about 4 years age are starting to fail relative to image quality.  This is likely due to exposure to sunlight so I would not recommend exposing cameras of this type to very bright views out of a window over long time frames.  Panasonic needs to provide some real world setups in their product information otherwise in my opinion the camera may not attract many users at this price level.  I have a couple of more expensive amd higher resolution security cameras but the documentation for them is literally 100 times more complete than for this one.  Even though I have quite a bit of experience with cameras of this type, I had to spend quite a bit more time than should be necessary by trial and error getting it to work.", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good quality but hard to setup to not use their IE plug in software", "Author": "Judy", "ReviewID": "R32OT0Q1309J6E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This will work without their IE plugin software, but it is hard to configure. This review specifically addresses how to setup the camera for external viewing WITHOUT using their Internet Explorer plug in and WITHOUT using a uPnP capable home gateway. I already have an old C210 camera for which I manually configured port mapping in my AT&T; UVerse gateway. However, the exact same approach does not work with the VT164 camera. The setup described in their manual (bottom of section15.1), does NOT work!!! However, using the standard \"web server\" port map on the UVerse gateway was successful. In other words, using a port map of 50001->80 does not work, or using 50001->50001 (and changing the port on the camera as shown in the manual) does not work. But using 80->80 works successfully.

Mo", "ReviewID": "R13Z65BJX0S0N0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I found that I ABSOLUTELY NEEDED to use IE for initial setup.  Using Win 7 & IE10 I found I needed to click the \"compatibility view\" button- then it asked to install the Panasonic ActiveX control -you need to OK it- which then stupidly pops up in the background with no indication that it did so-  I needed to minimize the IE window to see it.  Once it was installed, however, it worked fine.Once you do get it set up & working in IE, you can see the image on any non-IE browser.  You need to add \"/cam\" (forward slash cam) to the end of the address- otherwise it WILL NOT work (it will prompt you to install the control, but since Chrome doesn't speak ActiveX, it does nothing.)  After adding the \"forward slash cam\" to the end of the address I was able to view the camera in Chrome- but only view.  If I need to adjust anything, back to IE.The unit I got did not have the latest firmware so I ended up googling & finding it on Panasonic's website- the latest version at the time of this review is V1.81 (the file name is (vt164_181E.zip).  You can update the firmware (IE, of course) and keep all settings, which is good.The included program merely searches for any/all Panasonic cameras on your network.  For me, at least, that's all I need it for, especially since Panasonic webcams have odd default IP addresses.
