Sure worth its weight in gold.  Did add silicone around the cap and the tail after reading some of the other reviews about issues with leaking.Video is rather clear.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "cheap but worth the money! (needs external light source)", "Author": "S. Eckert", "ReviewID": "R2O4ES8C4X2VUM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Others say it won't work with Vista... but my Media Center PC running Windoze Vista recognized it immediately. Didn't have to install any drivers or any software. Roxio recognized the camera and would record from it. Windoze seems not to know it's there... so I just copied the executable AMCAP.EXE from the mini-CD and ran it. Done (no need to install, it just runs). Can see real-time preview in a stretchable window, can record to AVI disk file, simple and no hassle. Haven't found a way to store snapshots yet, but I have a movie player that can do that so I just record and capture stills later.Video quality is just fine for a $34 item.... if there is plenty of light. The shutter speed is slow so the image blurs if there is movement. It's not a multi-megapixel point-and-shoot, and the image can be a bit hazy due to the plastic protective cover, but there's a menu in the viewer to adjust brightness/contrast/white balance, etc. It probably won't last very long and the plastic cover will probably scratch, but if I use it 2 or 3 times I figure I've gotten my money's worth.The same product seems to come with many different length cables. Cables longer than this one apparently have a repeater box which means they won't thread through small pipes and that box isn't waterproof. This one has a brightness wheel on the USB connector and nothing but cable to the camera.UPDATE 1: Just had exactly the same experince on a Windoze 7 laptop. Plug it in, let Windoze install drivers, copy software from the mini-CD, run the software without installing. The mini-CD software can also access the laptop's built-in webcam.UPDATE 2: It survived being pushed down a driveway drain pipe with standing water, taped to a tape-style snake, but to my dismay I discovered that cranking up the LEDs causes reflection inside the plastic cover. Bad reflections! If there's really no light at all where you're using it, your range of site is extremely limited because the internal reflections wash out the image unless you turn the brightness down on the LEDs. This took it from 5 stars (cheap but you get what you pay for) to 4 stars (cheap and you need external lighting).", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Did exaclty what I needed it to do !!!", "Author": "John Grooms", "ReviewID": "R20DCYWUIUU3QM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to use it to 'see' behind walls and ceilings, and it worked perfectly for that. Having an adjustable LED brightness was a bonus - although I typically used it at highest brightness to see as 'far' as possible ahead. There was insulation in all spaces I used it for, and that wreaks havoc with the camera due to reflections from the LED's, but I was able to work around this. With help from the camera, taped to end of fish tape, and nylon rods at other times, and 10-gauge copper wire for shorter distances, I was able to see and (1) fish wire and fish tape through holes, (2) see fish tape and grab it from 'the other end' (meeting in the middle), (3) check for previous wire or plumbing that I DIDN'T want to drill through (saw both, and was able to avoid drilling through), and (4) identify obstructions in blind spaces like wooden fire breaks and floor joist stiffening blocks between the joists. The display on my laptop was very good (close focal range on camera), and the software supplied ran fine, and included several image enhancement options (brightness, contrast, etc.) I solved the 'issue' some people complain about with these, of not being able to tell which way is up or down, by taping the camera to the fish tape or rod, with enough of the guide leader sticking out in front of the camera, so that it could always be seen by the camera. Then, I taped the camera to the leader while watching the display, orienting the camera so that 'down' was always towards the leader. Then, where I could keep the leader oriented from the 'push end' (easier with flat fish tape), it was easy and intuitive to tell up/down direction. In retrospect, I didn't need anywhere near all 10m of USB cable, but it doesn't hurt having it! I'll be using this 'tool' a lot, and only wish I'd had it long ago, when I did a lot more of this kind of blind work.", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works as advertised.

The images are not all that clear, but were good enough to see when I got to the roots and discern a crack in the PVC pipe.  Now comes the hard part - the crack is about two feet inside the slab-on-grade foundation, so there'll be digging and tunneling.

I had a duct-cleaning vendor come out to examine my system and make a recommendation as to whether it needed cleaning or not.  After taking a cursory glance, the technician concluded that it needed to be cleaned, despite not even bothering to look at the ducts leading from the unit to the grates.  He spent more time figuring out how the ducts were run through the attic and walls, but only by using a flashlight while standing on a ladder in the attic.Since my system has an electrostatic filter with a traditional filter on the output side, I started to wonder if the dirty ducts were only on the input side.  So, I plunked down less than $20 for this camera.  I took off a vent / grate on the first floor, and the sheet metal duct was clean as a whistle.  I also have flexible ducts, so I figured those must be dirtier, since there is more surface area for dust and dirt to accumulate.  I taped the camera to a fish line and stuck it as far into the duct as I could get it.  I showed everything was clean, with absolutely minimal dust / pollen.  It seems doing regular maintenance on the heating system and cleaning the electrostatic cleaner twice a year really works.Needless to say, I won't be calling any duct-cleaning vendors soon.The camera works great, you can adjust the brightness of the LEDs to avoid glare, and the picture is surprisingly clear.  I had to download the software from the web and install it that way, since my Surface tablet doesn't have a DVD drive.  It took me a little while to find the download, but it is out there.Very happy with this purchase, though I've only used the camera for this particular application.

I Loaded the file that came on the disk with it so I could record video -  Recording software was very easy to figure out.I figured out where the \"top\" of the camera was and marked it with a sharpie.  Then I Used electrical tape to tape the camera to the end of a sewer pipe fish tape keeping the mark on top.  I then wire tied the cable along the fish tape every foot or so.  The sewer pipe was not full of water but was damp with residual water along the bottom so I never really submerged the camera to see if it was waterproof.  I did a test run with the LEDs turned all the way up and they did not provide enough light.  So, I taped a mini maglight next to the camera and that worked well even with the LEDs on the camera turned all the way down so there was less reflection off the plastic lens.  I was able to see the problem - a foot long section of pipe halfway between the house and the septic tank that had the bottom rotten out.I looked at renting a real sewer cam (Ridgid See-Snake) but it was $350 for the weekend.  I figured I would try the method I used instead since the camera was so cheap and I already had a sewer fish tape.  It has saved me several hundred over renting and probably close to $1000 if I were to of had hired someone to do the inspection.  The resolution was good enough for this application.

The product is cheap quality and whoever designed it didn't think about it's practical purpose.  The camera end has a very blunt tip on it with little or no control over the end of the scope such as wire placed 3 ft in length on the head end to bend it in a certain direction.  Unless your using this on straight pipe with clear line of sight it's worthless.  You'll spend hours just trying to get around a corner never mind a joint in the pipe.  The blunt tip catches everything along.  Since you have no control over the head and it's weighted like it is, the head will lean into the side of the pipe causing the blunt head to take an angled landing.Now I know what your thinking....just keep ramming it till it breaks free.  I thought the same thing and tried that.  Because of the aforementioned blunt weighted head it just keep landing on the joint at an angle because you can't steer it into the center of the pipe as you could if there was a wire in the casing to bend it opposite of the direction your pipes lean going down.  I tried to add an external wire and it really wasn't much help since it was just another thing to catch on things.Overall, worthless product.  More of a play toy then anything.  Now it does work good to see if you dropped some thing down the drain without having to pull the P trap but you won't need a 10M on for that.  Honestly don't waste your money and time with this product.  Even the head was designed to big for older homes plumbing and the angles you can get in pipes when dealing with that.
