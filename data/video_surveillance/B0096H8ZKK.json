I've had these Zmodo Systems in the past and have had my current one for 2 years. You will sit on hold for service, no doubt.  They are good for warranty replacement. I had my HD crash about 10 months into it and I got a new one no problem. Well, not exactly no problem but they took care of it.  I've also had to switch out 2 cameras because the IR lights seem to like to go out. Not all of them, but a few going out on a camera can significantly reduce your night vision. For the money I can't really complain. You know, Chinese product. Being able to see my house and move my cameras from my Android phone and IPad is cool! And I have it set up for email alerts to my phone when I'm away. If there is motion on a camera it will take a snap shot and email it to you.... Then you can open the app on your mobile device and hop on live to see what's going on back at the place. You will want to set up a separate email account for this, and turn the camera sensitivity down to about a 2-3 for outside, or else you will get a lot of  notifications. All in all, three stars, and I'd say I'm happy with it for the price.", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bad customer support, replacement for defective IP camera is an old defective camera", "Author": "cuticuteo", "ReviewID": "RTRWJVRKDCRDC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this system in hope that Zmodo stands for what it says on its website. I spent over $500 for this system. Three out of four camera is working fine. The 4th one kept falling off the network and needed power on/off several times a day. I complained to Zmodo and they told me they would gladly send me a replacement.After spending another $12 to ship the defective camera back, I waited for more than a week to receive the replacement IP camera. Surprise, it's an old, scratched up camera and what more, this one doesn't work either.Don't spend money buying Zmodo product. You get what you pay for: cheap system means defective parts and poor customer service.http://www.zmododirect.com/zmodo-4ch-nvr-system-1tb-hdd-with-4-wireless-day-night-ip-cameras/Very disappointed and I feel cheated by Zmodo company.Added feedback on Sept 19th, 2013:After getting some online support on July 17, the NVR was working well for about a month. Now it is failing and kept rebooting whenever I tried to change the web/video/phone port so I can view remotely. I emailed and called many times and they asked me to send back the NVR for repair. :-( After spending over $500 for this system, it worked reliably for only one month.PLEASE DON'T PURCHASE THIS OR ANY OTHER SYSTEM FROM ZMODO.

After many nights of frustration in trying to set the system up I tried to get help from the company. Their website claims they have 24/7 tech support = remote assistance, email support, customer phone call back support - all lies! I have tried all forms of their support systems - no response from the company from multiple emails, online support, phone call back, and their remote assistance (which tells you are connected and in a queue for assistance) is non existent. 14 hrs later and I was still in the queue.The system looks easy to set up. The instillation guide details how to set the system up but tells you nothing about what to do if one of the multiple steps do not work.Buy something else and save yourself the time and trouble you will get with this junk!", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "There is NO support for ZMODO products", "Author": "Fredric E.
