{"Reviews": [], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Easy Installation: Designed for ease-of-use, the iBulb screws directly into any standard E27 light socket, just like a normal light bulb. There are no complicated setup or installation procedures. Once it's screwed in, just use the buttons on the body of the device to set your recording preferences, and you're ready to catch some bad guys in the act.\nClean Modern Design: The iBulb was crafted to look just like a modern, universal, energy-efficient light fixture so that it would blend right into the existing furnishings of your home or office. It doesn't call any attention to itself, so wrongdoers won't be able to get self-conscious about their actions in its vicinity.\nAmazing Video: The iBulb processes 3GP video files at a crisp 640x480 resolution with its AMR9 32-bit Microprocessor. To conserve space on your MicroSD card, you can also film at 352x288. While the higher resolution will be more advantageous for catching crafty cashiers swapping out currency, the lower resolution is great for monitoring entryways and exists to see who's coming and going after hours.\nPerfect Vision Day or Night: With 24 940nm infared LED lights surrounding a high quality CMOS sensor, the iBulb is able to record incredible, high quality video all day and night. And since infared light is out of range of the human eye, thieves still won't know they're being watched.\nReal Time Mode: One of the iBulb's most convenient features is Real Time mode, which uses a motion sensor to conserve storage space while still catching every piece of action. While the iBulb normally records at 12 frames-per-second, Real Time mode records at 1 frame-per-second until the motion sensor is triggered by any movement within an 8-meter diameter, when it jumps back up to 12 fps until the motion stops.", "Name": "NEW Surveillance Infrared Light Bulb Camera Motion Detect Security DVR", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41sWNQ5WNnL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00GH2KTM4"}}
