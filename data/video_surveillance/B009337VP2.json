I recommend to be careful with the wires that carry the canbles tests before starting the final installation, I give it 4 stars because the DVR has no buttons, if the remote control is damaged or lost, end of story Security System.: (", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "zmodo 4 ch h.264 - good product", "Author": "mchusan", "ReviewID": "R31NJJ25ALEGEB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I tested this kit for three weeks without drawbacks-I set the DVR.

The software they use, to run the system with, seems very old and inflexible. The web-based access is based on ActiveX controls which no browser, but Internet Explorer (which i dislike because if it's loose security) uses. ActiveX is an old and very out-dated technology that often freezes and isn't very reliable.None of the PTZ features or Iris features, that the software have in it, seem to work at all.The email feature is buggy and often hangs. As well as the FTP feature isn't very reliable. The network file-sharing feature.....forget it. It shows up on the network but doesn't let you into the system to get the files.The Zmodo software, its self, isn't all that reliable either and won't run on some of my machines (which are all setup the same way) and have the exact same hardware in them. I know, odd.With my remote, it shuts the system off but not ON...yeah, that's dumb. Also ,the strength of the IR is a bit weak and you have to aim it directly at the system to get anything going.If you have to shut the system down (for any reason), manually, it will \"lose\" the hard drive and you have to physically open the system up, pull out the cables, then put them back in again and bam, it sees your hard drive again. Also, the direction say it won't acknowledge any drive less than 100GB. They also claim that, if you don't use a \"DVR\" specific hard drive, a regular one will die out VERY fast if you're recording a lot.This system isn't as stable or feature-reach as one might expect it to be and, in all honesty, i wish i hadn't bought it. However, the time and shipping to send it back (out of my office time) would cost me more than i paid for it so i'll just make due.Plus, i went to the Zmodo website....their support is terrible, their live support put me in a que then said they were \"not available\" after 27 mins.I guess the one redeeming quality this system has is the Android app that allows you to monitor all your cameras. While not overly feature-rich...it does work well on WIFI. An internet feed, which i've tried, often just isn't all that good, the frame-rate was way too low.Amendment to review:Recently the remote has become strange and seems to just \"ignore\" me at times. I'll probably buy another system because the cameras, from time to time, tend to \"wig out\" and go dead for a short time. The cable they use isn't the best quality and it's shielding (against weather) really isn't impressive.I would say to avoid this product unless you're just really well-schooled in dealing with technical issues and know how to tweak every bit to make it stable.", "Date": "June 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "works", "Author": "august", "ReviewID": "R3VCFZ6LDOBU0Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "il say the thing is prety good the cameras not camcorder goot put awsome night distance is as good as day if positiond right .  the packaging SUKS they would have gotn a 5 if it wasnt broke , il say i put screws in it it good( cant even notice with all screws in) but the fact is WOULD BE A 5  lolty ty", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "George Boozer \"bowhunter\"", "ReviewID": "R57VNKEZXVBGQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this system and ran it for about a week, and decided that I wanted more, so I ordered an 8 camera system, and put this one up for sale.  very clear video, and with help from ZModo tech support, relatively easy to set up.

The cameras are okay quality, however, the mounts that came with it are terrible ! 2 out of 4 broke upon install, a few don't even screw in at all. The DVR is very buggy; the time keeps on changing by itself. The menu are confusing and unintuitive (instruction/manual is definitely NOT intuitive at all). Remote Viewing took forever to setup. It will require a network technician or engineer to figure things out. It took me days to figure it out, despite that I've been working in the IT and Networking field for years.
