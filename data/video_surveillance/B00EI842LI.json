{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sketchy functionality - not recommended", "Author": "ccpff", "ReviewID": "R1YJQPAEY27T5H", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If you have no technical skills or basic understanding of wireless networking, then this will be a nightmare. The instruction booklet was fairly straightforward, and even with moderate understanding of wifi, I still had difficulty setting it up. If you need help, there is no phone # to call for support. Everything is via email - and it with a person overseas somewhere in China. The response time was acceptable - all generally within the same day, and they answered every question and addressed every topic. Took about 10 emails to get this up and running properly. But if you are they type that have no patience, then you need to look elsewhere. Once the camera was connected to my wireless network, I set up a free ftp address via instructions in the manual. Now I can watch anytime what is happening on my smart phone. Every now and then it had trouble connecting and showing a live view, and a simple reboot via web browser would get it going again. You can adjust the motion detection - there are 4 zones that can be customized, and have snapshots emailed to you. I have a junk email account that I use for that as it can get quite annoying to have all the pictures being sent to my primary email. When it rains, or there are lots of birds or bugs outside - it triggers the motion detection and sends an email. Picture quality is fairly good - a bit better than most basic security cameras - but not hi-def. Infrared nighttime is not as clear - but better than nothing and you can still see decent detail.After several months of using this, I regret purchasing this camera. It has failed on several occasions, and the only way to contact the seller is via email. They are in China - so it takes a ton of time and correspondence to diagnose and remedy the issues. They have always responded - but the camera keeps having problems. It keeps locking up and resending the same picture continually to my email - and the camera is also inaccessible when it locks up like this. It also intermittently fails to identify the existence of a memory card. Too many issues happening too often...definitely experiencing buyer's remorse....", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "trivision nc-326w hd 720p", "Author": "vermelho", "ReviewID": "RPDJBD28OPQRO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it pretty much does everything as addvertized  to me the only down side of this cam is that its too sensitive as far as sending me emails i pretty much turned down the sensitivity as much as i could and it still goes crazy sending me emails if i turn it down too much it sends me emails as failures and thats not good cause when that happens than the camera is not doing its job but other than that i think i would definetly  recomendining ot anyone it is a good cam for sure", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$420.00", "Features": "1280 x 720 (720p HD) Wireless IP Camera With Dedicated Free iPhone/iPad and Android Apps\nBuilt-in SD card DVR expandable to 64Gb & Multi-zone Motion Sensor; Infrared Night Vision to 15 metres\nWeatherproof (water and dust proof) to IP67 Rating\nMotion Triggered Recordings and Alerts by email and FTP\nWith a high quality rust proof metal casing, IP67 rating (water and dust proof), long range wireless, infra-red night vision, built-in DVR, motion sensor, email alerts and more, this is a truly all-in-one outdoor HD IP CCTV camera.", "Name": "TriVision NC-326W HD 720P Wi-Fi Wirelss Home IP Security Camera Outdoor Wapterproof, High Definition 1280 x 720 pixel, 45 Feet Night Vision, Motion Sensor, Built-in MicroSD card DVR Expandable to 64Gb, Install in 3 Steps with Our Free Dedicated Apps on iPhone, iPad and Android smart phones, Kindle Fire HD and more", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419Cz9pFSKL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00EI842LI"}}
