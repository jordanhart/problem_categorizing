Well worth the price", "Author": "George Hayduke", "ReviewID": "R3RK6ZPOYTJ6W7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like the intercom, and live mic's on the camera's.  Image is slightly grainy. Very acceptable and easily recognize a face.  Zoom on camera is not centered in unzoomed frame.  It is high and left.  Wireless range is somewhat lacking, and a steel sided house or shop will drop reception to 20 ft or less. Battery loses it's charge more quickly than I would have thought.  Unit is kind of difficult to get into the power dock. None of these issues strike me as unacceptable for this price. They seem like normal issues experienced with a less than high end unit.Overall I feel that this is a great unit with good features.  The price is very reasonable. Best unit I could find for the price.  I enjoy the portable monitor. I now consider this a must have. Fits easily in your pocket.  Super easy to install and setup.  I would buy again.  Easy to use.  Super easy to aim camera's with the portable monitor. That alone is worth buying this unit. Night vision is acceptable.  Easy to view on computer, tv, monitor ect.  Comes with all cables.  I built small rain shelters for my camera's out of old milk jugs. It actually helps hide the camera, protect it outdoors, and keeps the lens dry. I have experienced no problems due to outdoor mounting of camera's.I was leary of buying with all the bad reviews.  Took a chance, and am pleasantly surprised. Just make sure you use the correct power adapter for the monitor when you test it out for the first time.

The setup is easy and getting a picture to show up on the monitor was no problem. As far as remote viewing, I tried on 3 different laptops running two different OS (Win 7 and 8) and could never get the monitor recognized in order to do the Skype set up so no remote monitoring for me. The other negative is the motion detection at night. While the night view is not bad and pretty clear on mine, anything short of large objects (Cars, trucks, etc)will not set off the motion detection no matter what sensitivity setting is used. In fact, while we were on vacation one of the batteries were stolen out of my boat located right under the camera and no video was recorded at all !

For the price this little guy can do the job. I ordered 2 additional cameras with this and have a 4 camera setup. Pairing the added cameras with channel 3 and 4 was EASY!. I had all four on the screen at once. I set the resolution to the max of 640 X 480 on each camera. For me it is just fine! If you want an HD Camera then pay the price. Otherwise this is a simple but very useful system.I first began by installing one camera on the garage ceiling and plugged it in to an AC outlet. Then installed one in my Sunroom in the back (Backdoor) and plugged it in.The other 2 our in the front entry and kitchen (For grins).The Motion Detection is fine if you want to use it but it is limited on distance. I am talking 30 feet before you really have to start dancing to make it record. I do use the motion detection.NOTE: I purchased a 32 GB Micro SD card instead of using the 4GB card that comes with it. If you want to record continuously at the highest resolution expect about 29 hours of record time with a 32GB Micro SD card before it either stops recording or starts to overwrite the oldest files (Settable). But for motion detection, which seemed to work great you will get more time away from it. It does display in real time but if you are set for motion detection it only records if it sees motion. So far so good. I will let you know how the cameras do as far as longevity. Worth the money for me and the display is well made!", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Security", "Author": "A.

Even in the low/grainy 320x240 camera setting the cameras often freeze for 7 seconds or more constantly causing you to miss important moments. Video quality is not really good enough for positive id of pedestrians in the low setting and this is worse at night.One of my cameras is probably 25 feet away from the monitor and the signal goes in and out constantly and the camera freezes up completely missing what is going on. The motion sensor function often starts capturing movements after it is too late and the objects are already out of the screen. The motion sensor recording seems to be triggered by random things like clouds passing over and sometimes there is no visible cause for the triggering. If you reduce the motion trigger sensitivity it only seems to capture motion for half the field of view. The motion sensor function does not work at night. The auto capture function zooms into the screen with movement and usually leaves all the other areas vulnerable for 15 seconds minimum until there is no movement in the active screen, sometimes it seems to jump to the camera sensing more activity and sometimes it doesn't. The continual recording breaks the video up into an unreasonable number of separate files (10 min files I think) but it seems to vary. The video does not seem to display the date and time for evidence purposes in split screen mode. The monitor has folder and battery icons that really get in the way of the top of the camera feed while in the 4 split cam view, this is especially terrible when your split view for each feed is an inch or so tall. Monitor feed can not be turned off in manual recording, this sucks at night if monitor is in your bedroom and still video feeds probably can't be good for the monitor's lifetime expectancy.Pros: Good price for a system. Micro SD recording is convenient. Auto motion capture is nice to have. Wireless is convenient and cameras are easy to install. Monitor is nice and portable.

The other is the fact that it cuts the auto record into 10 minute intervals, i would love if it was one solid file, but thats me and for my purposes.

I ordered two extra camera's and you can sync up to four with this one. I set it to record by motion and it records for 30 seconds unless there is continuous motion, then it'll record longer. I had to drill a couple holes in my garage to plug in the power cord and filled in the holes with caulking after they were plugged in. They don't stick out and keep a low profile. I really like the portable monitor. It holds a charge for about 4-5 hours with power saving mode on. I have an extra docking station so I can charge it in the living room and my bedroom. It works really good. It came with an 8 gig mini SD card which is more then enough if you have it record on motion. The only thing I don't like about it is it'll only record one camera at a time.

I have played with that a bit and the camera would always start recording me right as I walk into its field of view.- The system worked \"out of the box\" which means that other then having to fine-tune the setup I had a picture pop up the second I plugged in the camera power.Con's:- The mounting feet are near useless. I had to use pliers to tighten them enough so the camera wouldn't move which ultimately resulted in a broken off screw. They are also too short. I had to use a block of wood to mount the camera far enough from the wall so the antenna wouldn't be hitting it.- The scheduling system is useless. Since I simply manually record 24/7 I ultimately decided not to bother with this system but what I did figure out was that you can set a single \"on\" and \"off\" event each day and the system would only recognize a setup if I switched it \"on\" first before switching it back \"off\". So setting it up to start recording on an evening and stop recording the next morning is for some reason not possible. If however you want it to record somewhere during daytime hours this system will do that.- When recording, none of the buttons on this thing work except the \"manual record\" button. This also means you can not turn the volume up or down while the system is recording. The volume switches also act as \":play/pause\" and \"stop\" buttons while playing back videos which means that you also cannot change the volume during playback. The only time you can change the volume is during live view.- The screensaver function only works if the camera is idle. This means when manually recording, the screen is constantly on.Other:- You can choose low video quality (320x240) and high video quality (640x480). The low quality will record at about 3-4 frames per second with good sound quality and if you don't need to recognize faces at the other side of the street this is plenty good. The high quality will drop down to about 1-2 frames per second and I found it struggling to maintain a good connection with the sound intermittently being distorted.- When running continuously this system records 10 minute long files rather then one long one. Depending on contrast (less at night, more during day) the files turn out to be between 50 and 80 MB in size. The 16 GB card I installed will hold just about 2 days worth of continuous footage. I activated the option to overwrite the oldest file when the card is full so it acts like a continuous loop camera.- As mentioned by other reviewers the camera does require a power chord being plugged in while the DVR runs on internal batteries that can be charged on the charging cradle.There you have it.Ultimately I am satisfied with the result, but I would never recommend this system due to its many flaws.", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice Features.

Motion sensitivity is a bit flaky and inconsistent even regardless of sensitivity setting. A bird flying across the camera field of view will frequently initiate recording, while a car moving sometimes will NOT. Only one camera can record at a time. If one camera is tripped on by the wind moving a tree branch and that camera records, you will miss recording of a person walking in the view of the other camera at the same time. But the biggest complaint I have is the reliability. After almost two weeks, when used on with the higher resolution the monitor will sometimes (about 1/3 of the time) make a high pitch static sound that is very annoying and a line will develop across the view screen. After several tries I finally got through to Uniden support and they claim that is not normal and want me to send back (at my expense) the monitor to be repaired. They say it should \"only\" take 2-4 weeks! Meanwhile, of course, the cameras are worthless without the monitor. No replacement, prepaid mailer, etc. Nothing.
