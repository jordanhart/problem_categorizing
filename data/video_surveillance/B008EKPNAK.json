Setup is incredibly easy, and viewing the camera's anywhere via the internet works well.The company support is superb and responsive.  They seem to be improving the product via firmware releases regularly.It does run quite hot, and I was surprised by this.  But I was assured this was the case.  It does make me a little concerned for the hard drive longevity.  And I don't currently know of the hard drive can be replaced by me or not when that time comes.Package came with 4 camera licenses, but they immediately bumped it up to 10.All in all, a solid little product that deserves the attention it has received.", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$899.00", "Features": "Cloud Powered Surveillance\nApple, Windows, iPhone, iPad, Android\nPlug and Play Installation\n300+ Camera Options\nWorks on Almost Any Network", "Name": "Smartvue S9Q32 - 320GB Server", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31-NYqAH2bL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008EKPNAK"}}
