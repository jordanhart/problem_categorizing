Fayne", "ReviewID": "R805JTEG0GIXU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "aside from the fact that this product looks and feels like the cheapest poor quality toys from a dollar store, the so-called solar panel was broken and hanging out of where it was supposed to be affixed, barely there by 2 wires that were exposed and probably shorted out. It was thrown into a flimsy mangled box no thicker than what tissue paper is sold in, and the mounting hardware was tossed into the box loose - so probably some of it was missing as well. The Chinese must be laughing themselves silly over the stupid Americans who actually pay money for the crap they send us. Were it possible to give this product ZERO STARS, I would have done so, but the Amazon rating system doesn't allow for that.", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "security camera solar one s the only way to go", "Author": "Robert Shumway", "ReviewID": "R1ADCQFQ2CIBKJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "solar with battery back up is the only way to go Will you remenber to change the batteries?

They don't work!", "Author": "KURT E LEONARD", "ReviewID": "R3VHZNXY8ZYQXV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased 4 of these cameras. One had a solar battery that didn't work right out of the box. After 2 weeks of use all 4 are now not operating as advertised. Three cameras have non functioning solar batteries and one camera has a solar panel that stopped working altogether.  The solar battery is advertised to operate the light for 5-7 days after fully charged.  The solar batteries on my cameras only keep the light working for a couple of hours after dark so far. Who knows how long that will last. So I must put standard batteries in all of them to get the light to work properly.I bought solar so I wouldn't have to climb ladders every few weeks to change batteries. Depending on the angle of the set up, some of the cameras have to be removed to change the batteries. What a pain and it won't be cheap!!The good news is Amazon stepped up and gave me a full refund. What a great company!  But don't buy these cameras unless you want battery operated ones. You can just buy the ones without the solar panels for less.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "aliwishes", "ReviewID": "R1INK1W5RTUYVT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have 3 of these and the real ones and you can`t tell the difference. They have a weak spot on some and that is the glass solar plate which can fall out which I glued in and it works perfectly. They don`t have to be mounted in the direct sunlight. 3 to 4 hours charge will last days. It is high quality,weighty and durable in all kinds of weather. It has a charge light and on/off button. Anyone that squawks about the \"fake\" being recognizable doesn`t know security cameras. The product is sound-the assemblers are lazy on the glue. Mine have gone thru rain,snow,sleet,hail and the hot summer and are performing flawlessly.", "Date": "July 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "As described", "Author": "Ahmad N.
