Everything worked great during installation and setup, until I started running the main program. I could see the picture from the camera for a second, but as soon as I tried to set up the view on my screen the program would stop and pop up a message that it was closing down due to an unexplained technical issue. I opened up a service ticket and contacted the Lorex people. They called back after few days to work through the issue. They couldn't figure it out, so they escalated the problem to other experts, and they called a few days later. They couldn't figure it out but said they'd be working on it. A few more days down the road I got an email saying they were still working on it, but five minutes later I got an email saying the ticket was closed. That was a couple weeks ago. I'm still waiting. My camera still doesn't work. Frustrating! I really wish this camera would work!  At this point I have no idea if they just brushed me off, or if they're still working the issue. Only time will tell, and I'll report in here later whatever happens, pro or con. Lorex, are you still on this case??? For what it's worth, I have a Windows 7 Home Edition computer with all the latest updates from Microsoft.Update: I opened a new ticket at Lorex a few days ago, hoping to get some explanation or further help. Two days later they closed my ticket without contacting me or providing any explanation whatsoever. I'd write to the president of the company, but I'm so frustrated I'll let it go and not plan on ever purchasing Lorex products. That's the best I can do. Changing my stars rating down as low as I can go. But I'll provide an update if I ever hear from Lorex again. Doesn't seem likely though since they completely ignored my request for help, without any explanation, apology, or anything!

The Ping series supports up to 4 cameras.  I was happy to discover that the new high definition LNC-204 would work with my existing setup.  What the LNC-204 has that the 104 series does not:* High definition 720p resolution* Built-in speaker* Temperature sensor (infrared)What this means is that the 204 will message me (text or email) if the temperature gets out of range (I set the top end at 100F), sound an alarm if triggered (for any reason) and broadcast my voice from my smart phone without attaching an external speaker (which was required on the 104 series).  Combined with higher resolution, it was the perfect fit to round out my set of four cameras.The image quality of the 204 is a vast improvement.  But although the image is very good, it is not the 720p you would expect from say a down scaled DVD.  However, I found that enlarged snapshots and video from my phone, PC and the units SD card were more than adequate for home surveillance.What I really like about the Lorex LNC system is that it makes monitoring my house from my Android based Galaxy S3 a snap.  The free app is easy to use once you play with it for a bit.  Most all camera functions are addressable via the app and setting motion or IR alarms when I walk out of the house takes less than a minute (of note, each camera is set separately - a must if you have pets and need a \"pet zone\" ).  I live in a large metro area and police will not respond to ringing home alarms.  They require a direct call with positive confirmation of intrusion before they will respond.  The Lorex system will send you notification via text message or email that includes an image.  Then the police are just one phone call away.Also, live viewing of any camera is fast via the app (or via network computer).  Once the app is opened, one touch gets you sound and video for any of your cameras - and with the new camera I can even talk back and the camera will project my voice.  The 204 even tells me the temperature in my house on the image display.  One last note, the night vision is excellent on all of the cameras.  In nearly no light I can see across a 30 foot room (the image is black and white for low light conditions).The setup for the 204 is just like the 104 series.  That is to say, the first camera will take you awhile to set up and learn the settings - but once set up it works very well.  The only real difference in set up between the 104 and the 204 relates to the temperature feature.  My two setup tips:* If you want an SMS text message sent to you for an alarm, you have to set it up as an email alarm.  Just use your carrier's information and your phone number for the email recipient.  For example I use:  5551234567@mms.att.net for the email address where 5551234567 is my cell phone number.  Works perfectly.* The initial login information for setting up the camera on your PC is `admin\" with no password.I use this system nearly every day.  When I am away from home, it gives me great piece of mind to be able to quickly view my house, check on the dog and set alarms.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good luck getting it to operate", "Author": "D.

Not so good for outdoor night use.", "Author": "J. Donaldson \"Cal-diver\"", "ReviewID": "R2Y0RU66S3GUFB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera is quite expensive compared to the competition. It has some advantages, mostly in the very clear documentation. It also is very easy to set up.This wireless camera might make a very good baby monitor, and as it has Android and iOS free apps it can be very handy.I have a Foscam  FI8910W which was only $70 on Amazon. It is the only other wireless camera I've ever used so it is my reference.I was excited to see the Lorex LNC201 was a higher resolution system than the Foscam. The one things I wished I had on the Foscam was better resolution. However the Lorex night use simply isn't as good as the Foscam, even though the Foscam is much lower resolution. I think it has to do with the Lorex only having a single infrared light while the Foscam has a whole ring of lights. Also the video feed from the Lorex is irregular and jumpy while the Foscam is solid. The Lorex has many settings. Perhaps with time I could find settings (resolution, frames per second, etc.) that would produce a better image.I don't have a daytime or indoor use for a wireless camera. That may be where the Lorex shines.My problem is animals that come into our yard in the dark of night. We have gophers, skunks, raccoon, deer and fox. The raccoon do the most damage and we've been trying to find ways to prevent them from being in our yard.The Foscam printed instructions are a joke, while the Lorex instructions are quite good. Several of the Foscam software features simply don't work (like setting the camera date and time), while all of the Lorex software features work well.The Foscam, for a much lower price, is built with better materials, and has remote pan and tilt features. It also has a wider angle capture area than the Lorex.The Lorex is all cheap plastic with a metal base, expensive, and has good quality daylight images.The Foscam automatically switches from infrared black and white to daylight color. The Lorex requires you to do a manual switch from black and white to color. Both the Foscam and Lorex have two way audio. Both can be monitored on a PC or handheld devices with a browser or app.For my use the motion detection is of no use on either the Foscam or Lorex because I'm using them outside (neither model is suggested for outside use) where the trees and bushes tend to trigger the motion detection, and both fail to register alarms when a raccoon in in the image but more than 10' away from the camera.I recorded video on my PC with both the Foscam and Lorex. The Foscam created 60 minute videos while the Lorex produced 5 minute videos which made it very hard to review a whole night of video files. There may be a way to change the file length of the Lorex but I couldn't find it (I'm technically savvy).For my money the Foscam is a much better value for nighttime use. The Lorex might be better for inside use due to the higher resolution if you need that capability. Other than resolution, setup, and documentation I can't think of a single feature that isn't available on one camera vs the other. Oh yes the Lorex has a temperature reading but I found that to be an odd feature although it seems to be useful to others.As the Lorex is intended for inside use, or perhaps use through a window to outside (didn't work for me) it may indeed be a fine wireless camera for you, albeit a bit on the expensive side.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice but you can get similar functionality from a camera half the price.", "Author": "Jerry Helsing \"jlhelsing\"", "ReviewID": "R3HR6SD4DGF8V5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This was a very easy camera to setup.  Also, the ability to record onto an SD card is nice since many internet cameras do not allow for that.  The picture quality is similar in the daytime to my other cameras, however, the night vision was much worse than my other cameras (Foscam).  I give it 3 stars because it has some really nice features but the lack of night vision quality and the price puts it to an average score for me.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Is This Security Camera for You?", "Author": "B. McGregor \"BigMG\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZIJLQQVKVCG4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I\u2019d been toying with the idea of getting a security system for months. The big security providers wanted a huge commitment and I couldn\u2019t see spending all that money while not really being able to comprehend all the benefits. It seems like most places sell emotions without providing much detail.This is different. It\u2019s a great way to explore what your evolving needs in a home security system might be. Some commented about the price, but when compared to a \u2018professional\u2019 system, it\u2019s really a good deal. It\u2019s just one camera, but can be expanded to several cameras when needed.And, this one camera gives me several systems all rolled into one.Let\u2019s start with nighttime security. It\u2019s got an IR camera so you get great night time viewing (black & white, of course) in an otherwise pitch black room. Like playing mind games with your cat? Oh, the fun you\u2019ll have. Also has a hi-res color day time camera for clearer viewing.  Both take snapshots, record video.There\u2019s a motion sensor, various alarms, and my favorite, an intercom (especially useful in above mentioned misuse). It\u2019s WiFi portable, with the only drawback being the power cord.I experimented by setting it up  all over the house just to get the feel of where I\u2019d like a security system/monitor.  This was much more helpful that I\u2019d first imagined.It set up easily with my Samsung\u2019s t959 Android O/S. Tablets without cell capabilities, like my Nexus 7, don\u2019t seem to support this. Not a problem, my phone handles the app very well.The LOREX LNC201 has turned out to be a lot of fun and extremely useful. Checking in with what\u2019s going on while I\u2019m in and out at all hours of the day and night is just one advantage.Easy to set up. Give it a B+ for stability (it has crashed once when I was on a phone call using Bluetooth accessing Lorex on the WiFi \u2013 easily forgiven).One complaint is that I had trouble getting it to pass through the MAC filter. I\u2019ll update if there\u2019s something I missed.Seriously worth the investment.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Two and a half stars", "Author": "She", "ReviewID": "RUEFRCZBU77BF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was excited to get this camera, but unfortunately, I had a lot of problems with it.

However, it does not do me any good since I am limited to the my computer desk area because of the very short cords.The picture I got on my computer was pretty good for a security camera.  There wasn't a lot of graininess, and it was in color, though the colors were muted.  The lag was very slight and not bad.  I agree with another reviewer that the field of view is pretty narrow, and it does feel pretty flimsy.I looked on Lorex's website for help with the issues I was having and could not find an answer in the Self-Serve section.  It was very confusing and unhelpful.  I could not find an email address either.  I found a \"create a ticket\" option, but when I clicked on it, it said I had to create an account, and I just didn't bother because it was a hassle.  I did find a number for technical support: 1-877-755-6739.  I have yet to call because I haven't been able to find the time.  Again, it's just a hassle.  I learned in one of my business classes that a bad sign of customer service is if they do not make it easy to complain.For such an expensive camera, it should have had a better manual, better support, a better website, and just a better quality product.

The Lorex LNC201 Wireless HD Dual Lens Network Camera has some really nice features but I had a really difficult time getting the camera to connect over Wifi to my iDevices.  After downloading the iOS app for my iPhone and iPad,  I went through the wireless setup steps.  The app locates your Wifi network and generates a scan code that the camera then reads.  After several failed attempts to access the camera via the devices,  I then tried connecting the camera directly to the router and accessing through my desktop.  This worked and I was able to get the video stream on my PC. I then reattempted to connect the camera over Wifi and for some reason (I'm really not sure why) this time it connected.  All in all, this took a couple of hours but once it was working properly,  I was happy with the quality of the 720p video stream.One of the other features that I really like about this camera is the built in mic/speaker.  I have this setup to record the area outside of my covered front door and the camera allows me to converse with visitors such as a vendor or a delivery person.The camera also has good night recording capablities.  Even in darkness, the picture quality (black and white) is still pretty clear.I'm thinking of getting additional cameras to set up in various areas of the house.

I just plugged in the power cord and plugged the ethernet cord to my router. I was fortunate enough to choose a place that was near a power strip and my router. Then I put the disc in my PC and installed the software. There is a newer version available, than what is offered on the disc, and it immediately uninstalled the old software and installed the newer version.Then all I had to do was name the camera, enter the camID which is on the back of the camera, and enter the default password, after entering the default password I was prompted to enter a new password, which I did. I can now see my front porch and check on my bike, while sitting inside my house. The picture is in black and white, but it is fairly clear, even at night.There had been countless times when I wanted to look outside without actually poking my head out, now I can.

Set up was easy (although the instructions are incorrect).  Depending on where your wireless access point is located and how large your home is, a weak wireless signal may be an issue.  There are locations in my home where I can't get a strong enough signal for it to connect and operate.My opinion may be slightly biased in favor of this unit because on the first day of usage it caught an intruder and alerted me on my cell phone.  Very cool! (the security camera, not the intruder!)However, even though this camera may be very useful, Lorex needs to put a ton of work into improving the software.  It is amazingly annoying to work with the software!  My biggest complaint perhaps is that you can't schedule it to record to your hard drive on your computer (when recording to your hard drive on your computer you must manually start and stop recording),  thus you essentially *must* buy a micro SD card.  And this has the huge problem in that any intelligent burglar (if they notice the camera) will just steal your camera and the recording along with it!Great features:* Okay (most people would probably call it \"good\") video quality - not like watching a movie but good enough for the purpose!* Alarms sent to cell phone* The \"MUST HAVE\" feature is the combination of the alerts and ability to view the video on your phone no matter where you are while the \"action\" is happening.* Audio!Problems:* Terrible software* It's easy to get spammed by a ton of alerts on your cell phone* Incompatible video format (I did find that \"MPlayer\" would play the files - unlike another reviewer wrote just renaming them to .mpg does not seem to work with all software - none of my video editing software seems to be able to read the files at all)* In the dark the Infrared emitter glows red giving away the position of the camera even though all other LEDs can be shut off with a software settingHere are some of my notes:When changing settings, the \"update\" takes the camera offline for several seconds.The accuracy of the temperature sensor appears to be very poor (reading 76 degrees when another thermometer reads 71)Image at any resolution has some pixelation (especially with motion but even static snapshots).The audible alarm (without external amplification) is quiet and might cause a burglar to die of laughter.PC Software:Every change to the camera settings requires entry of a user name and password.No ability to configure any schedule (must use \"web configuration\")Recording (to hard drive) is an \"on/off\" button (not upon detection of motion or a schedule)Web Configuration:To set up recording you first enable the method (SD card or NAS), then you can set up a schedule and select whether it is continuous, motion triggered, PIR triggered or temperature triggered (so you can watch your house burn down?)Power consumption:4 watts (night vision - infrared)3 watts (day - color)Recording seems to be fairly efficient because it can be set to only record while something is happening (motion detected), it uses about 47k per second of recording.

For security purposes, I don't want my camera to have the SD card - thief breaks in, steals camera and evidence, what's the point?  Similarly, I don't want to record continuously to a dedicated iPhone/iPad.  If I could configure the cameras to record to my wireless 4TB hard drive then I might be alright with 24/7 recording (not ideal but I'd accept that option and just dedicate the drive and lock it in the attic or some place a thief wouldn't actually find it).On the positive side, if you don't want this camera for security purposes, the daytime image quality is great.  The infrared night vision image quality is okay - certainly can identify things.  The wireless setup is a breeze - so simple.

Usually I could just close the app and start it again, and the app would regain connectivity.  However, sometimes it was necessary to reboot the camera.  This was only a problem for me during configuration - while I'm trying to find the right brightness/image quality settings, and so on.  However, it is so consistent that I am certain they could improve the error handling in the Lorex Ping app.I wanted to love this camera because it has great specs, and was very affordable (got dual cams at nice discount through costco.com).  The wireless networking was great, streaming video was solid, no glitches.  I am so disappointed that it is basically useless for me as a security camera!  Maybe it's a great nanny monitor, or baby monitor?", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cool security camera for home users with night vision, two-way audio is so-so", "Author": "Shi-Hsia Hwa", "ReviewID": "R2ZSPC5DI68O3T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a nice basic network security camera for home users. It was fairly easy to set up and has good features like night vision and a speaker for two-way audio. However, the user interface for accessing it from a PC is rather clunky; the Android app actually seems better.Setup:Wired setup using an Ethernet cable worked flawlessly.Wireless setup: The way you enter your WiFi password is to type it into the Lorex Ping app on your smartphone/tablet and hold it in front of the camera, which scans the QR code from your phone to acquire the password. Using my Android phone with their app took a couple of tries. I don't know why but I had to run through the steps twice.  Anyway, it still took less than 5 minutes in total to get it working.The annoying part however is that it seems to have forgotten the password after being powered off (unplugged) for a while. The QR code didn't work and I had to resort to connected it with an Ethernet cable, then entering the WiFi password manually in the Android app (Blue arrow next to camera ID in camera list > Camera settings > Network > WiFi network) It can take several minutes to reconnect to WiFi.Remote connection and security:Once connected to your local network whether by cable or WiFi, a smartphone or PC on the same network with the Lorex app can detect the camera and connect to it. You are strongly encouraged to set a password for the camera to prevent other people from gaining access to it.Viewing video worked fine on both my Android phone and my PC (see additional comments below). Away from home over a mobile connection, video seemed a little slower but not too bad.The Android app is pretty good and has a lot of options in the settings for connection, security, setting alarms, etc.I really don't like the design of the PC software. It looks like it's from the 90s, and the mic and speaker icons are reversed in what I intuitively thought their functions were (others may disagree). The aspect ratio of the video is squashed horizontally even though it says 1024 x 768, and it is pixelated (this is testing with both my PC and the camera on my home LAN, so it shouldn't be a bandwidth problem?)Video:The framerate is fine when testing it in my own home. It's choppy over mobile broadband but I imagine that's an effect of my mobile provider's speed rather than the Android app, since display on the app is fine when testing it over WiFi at home. It seems OK when viewing from someone else's home network.The nice thing is that this has an infrared camera and an infrared LED which should turn on automatically when it's dark. The threshold for when it turns on is a little darker than it should be, however, because when it's evening there is a period when it's too dark to see but the infrared hasn't cut in yet. When it works it's a nice sharp grayscale.Audio:The pick-up from the microphone is not exactly fantastic but then again, it's not intended to be an audio recording device. There is a fair bit of background hiss. You can however hear sounds well enough.As for the speaker - it works OK now that I've discovered that the default gain in the PC app is set way too high. I thought something was wrong because words were coming out extremely crackly and unintelligible when I spoke into my laptop mic. Turning down the gain in the PC app fixed the issue. (The top volume slider is for output of your PC mic to the camera's speaker; the bottom slider is for camera mic to PC speakers. They don't line up with the icons and they're unlabelled - another example of the rather poor PC app design.)In the Android app there is a single button to activate/mute 2-way audio instead of separate ones for the speaker and mic.There is also an alarm button that sets off an annoying alarm sound. I guess this would be useful to let intruders know you've seen them.Motion sensor function:Have not tested yet. Will update when I do.Alarms:You can set alarms for either the motion sensor or the infrared camera to go off in the app or send you an email. Have not tested yet. Will update when I do.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Home Security System", "Author": "S.

Setting it up with my Samsung Android phone was fairly straightforward thanks to the easy to use App.  Once installed, it took a couple of hours to really test and sample the full array of the Lorex LNC201's features.  It took me longer than expected to settled on exactly where to position the camera for maximum viewing capability.  As useful as a camera like this is, not putting it in the proper place can easily negate its intended purpose.  The real-time monitoring offers a very clear and clean picture with enough clarity to actually make out details on faces.  There was a slight lag time but only by a few seconds, which I would not consider to be an issue.  I had no problems with the way this camera operated in daylight or indoor lighting conditions.  The nighttime viewing was understandably not as sharp but still very nice thanks to the infrared feature.  I was surprised to see it was a black and white picture and not the standard military style green tint that we are all used to seeing.  I don't know if one is necessarily better than the other, but I was not disappointed with the infrared that came with the Lorex LNC201.  My only complaint is that it has to be manually adjusted.  There really should have been an option to have it do so automatically with changing lighting conditions.  I also have to wonder if the rather high retail price is entirely justified given that there are other comparable cameras that are noticeably cheaper.  Overall, this is a very nice camera that lives up its promises.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Software nearly cripples a good product", "Author": "traderje \"traderje\"", "ReviewID": "R14UN0MDEEKE7B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The kindle app available at this review was no good.

I have it set up facing the front door and window. When testing it, it took 8 seconds to take the photo. I have it a good deal away, but in that time whoever came through the door was long gone. It I put it much farther back, to try and get more room in the photo, then you loose clarity. I feel it would be better if it took photos more like 3-4 seconds and then every 3-4 seconds after.

This company appears to have very poor support.  Thankfully I'm a geek and I ddn't have issues with the camera.  I got the camera to watch our dog when we are away but also for security.Setup is incredibly easy on my iPhone.  The QR Code process requires you to download a QR Reader App before setup but you more than likely have one.  The app did freeze during setup once but I pulled the app out of memory (Double-click Home button and swipe the app up...in the newer iOS's) and the re-opened the app and everything was working.  Support may be awful but they have really thought through viewing a camera on a mobile device.  MANY options especially those that allow you to view video when you have poor connectivity.  I can email/message/notify myself when the motion detector goes off.  I can also save pictures or video off the video camera.  If someone breaks in I have that data even if they take the phone.  I'm not easily impressed but the night vision is fairly impressive.  I've tested it in very low light but not complete darkness.  Two way audio communication can be very handy.  I can speak to my wife or dog while I'm away.  She can respond.  I can also set off an alarm sound on the camera itself.PROS:- I setup without reading the manual (No RTFM)- Connectivity to the camera from my phone when I'm not on my wi-fi required nothing special.
