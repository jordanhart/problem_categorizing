The DVR fan is very loud and we thought a couple cameras were bad. We contacted the seller and they immediately sent us another system in which we traded out what we needed to but only to find it made no difference, it's in the quality of this product. We had already ran the cords to where each camera goes so taking it all down would be to much of a hassle, so that's why we didn't do a return. The only thing we can do is buy a better camera to make the system useful. While viewing from the monitor you can see okay, but in viewing the recordings the quality is horrible.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$599.99", "Features": "Cameras have a built in microphone for audio monitoring capability\nView and access live and recorded video remotely over the internet or mobile phone\nLED lighting distance: max 100ft\nHard Drive: 1TB\nConnection type: 4 RJ12 ports", "Name": "Revo R4D2GT2GCMB-1T 4-Channel 1TB DVR Surveillance System with 10.5-Inch Built-In Monitor and 4 700TVL 100-Feet Night Vision Cameras (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-zKjY8V4L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00C2NMO8E"}}
