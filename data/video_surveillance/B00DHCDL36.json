Great for a low price.", "Author": "aj4mq", "ReviewID": "R3UNR4PAM1H8VM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am very impressed with this. I might have designed something like this using my Parallax Propeller chip. Rugged case, powers from USB (120V wall adapter), and powers camera when testing (very nice), PTZ commands and includes scan for address and watch commands (so you can see the actual data.)Battery not connected on delivery, but easy to find door under outer case.Comes with carrying case (very nice, but basic) with spots for manual, wires and unit, includes Belt-loop on case, strap for case and one for unit. (Unit was a little hard to get on, but if you're careful, you can loosen the top screws to get it on easier.This unit even tests Cat-5 with a proper tester, able to check all 8 wires individually, and indicate how it is miswired if necessary.Generates color bars, and operates in PAL/NTSC. I can't wait to use this thing high up a ladder instead of my cell phone logged into the DVR by internet. Even includes a pass-thru so you can do both.I will be recommending this to friends. We'll see how long it lasts.", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DHCDL36"}}
