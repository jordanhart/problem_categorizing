Out of the box the instructions and the software are flawed. There are misspellings and you cannot read all of the help screens. A little about me, I work at a software company as a trainer and technical writer and if I produced documentation this bad I would be fired or the company I work for would go under.The camera did not want to sync up to my wireless router that was right next to the camera during setup.  They have you start by connecting the camera and router through a cat 5 cable they supply.  After muddling through the awful instructions and finally getting my router to see the camera you need to disconnect the cable and let the wireless network find the camera.  This did not work after about 10 attempts.  To make matters worse, when the system tells you to hook the camera back up to the router using the cable, the camera never acts as though it is plugged back in.  (Bad network card in the camera?) I looked through their manual (waste of time) and the support forums (no response) and an e-mail to 2 of their support teams, I Quit!  I never even got an auto-reply from their support e-mail service.  Bad Product + Bad Support = Don't Buy!", "Date": "August 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "Jason Duggins", "ReviewID": "R63F1N9IMMDWE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera works very good. The e-mail function on it is nice too except you can't set the motion up for certain size objects. When I set it up on the lowest motion detection it still picks up the leaves moving on my bush by my patio. I tried to talk through the camera and that function doesn't work very well. You have to switch between listen and talk and I could hear the person by my camera but he couldn't hear me. The night vision works very good.The downside is the camera is very hard to set up. It is definitely not plug and play. The software does have issues it locks up a lot if you don't open tabs in another window. It doesn't like to run unless it is Internet Explorer.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DE9QIQE"}}
