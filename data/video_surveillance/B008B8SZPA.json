{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Have the wired version of this camera ...", "Author": "atlas1059", "ReviewID": "R3O4C7JJJ8240J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have the wired version of this model and it works perfectly. The SDE-5001 (which is the system I have) can take up to 16 cameras. So, I have 14 wired Samsung cameras connected to my system and purposely left 2 slots blank so that that I could connect these wireless cameras to it.  The place where I wanted to install the 2 remaining cameras couldn't be wired.  It would be too impractical so I bought these cameras instead.Installation was super simple. I literally connected the wires and the camera found the base station in less than 15 seconds.  The images were just as sharp as the wired Samsung cameras. The only problem was when I started to move position the camera to where I wanted which was about 30 feet away from the base station. I initially put it behind some plastic mini blinds against a window facing the driveway. Before I know it, the monitor shows \"camera out of range\". I experiment with the different positions and found that it was the mini blinds that were blocking the signal. Go figure. The other issue I had with this camera was that you can't place it against an inside window looking out.  The infrared gets reflected on the window at night and all you see are a circle of lights.If you think about it, there aren't many places you can put this camera outside. You need a plug to plug it into and the line is only 6 feet long. Not stating the obvious, where outside would one have a plug available? Even if you had a plug, it would be about 2-3 feet from the ground at most making it easy for any intruder to unplug the camera. In addition, while the camera is said to be IR 65 compliant ... basically almost water-proof (water proof is IR 66), the electrical line / plug is not.While the idea is good, I think it can only be mainly used indoors ... maybe a baby's room or for monitoring the inside of the house where you won't be worried about someone simply unplugging it.", "Date": "February 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good wireless camera for Samsung DVR.", "Author": "R Gibbons", "ReviewID": "R3OZVKS9XBSQ28", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Cons:  This has fewer frames per second compared to the wired version (SEB-1005&6), so the video is not as smooth.Plus: The Audio signal is better (less background hiss) compared to the Samsung (SEB-1006R) wired version.  Well built.I used this to run to my front door porch, where it was very hard to get a network cable.  I plugged the 120V DC adapter into the porch light (which is always on), so I didn't have to run a 120V wire to the camera.The reception was not always good when I put the receiver next to the DVR (digital video recording box) through 4 walls and 40 feet away,  So I ran the Cat-5e network cable halfway to the camera (into a closet) and the signal is very strong (only 2 walls to penetrate).The Camera and receiver have pairing buttons.  Once they are paired they stay paired, even if you have a power failure, (nice feature).The Receiver has two video output connections:  you can use either (or both at the same time).  There is a Cat-5e network cable jack that hooks up to the DVR (same as used for the wired cameras).  There is also an RCA composite Video connection to drive a monitor.The receiver can be powered by either the Cat-5e network cable (provides 12V from DVR),  or from a 12VDC/120VAC adapter, (you don't need both).  The 12V DC adapter is only needed if you want to view live from the RCA output on the receiver, instead of recording to the DVR.The included bracket is of higher quality than is provided with the wired cameras (I'm also using 7 wired cameras).Because this was 50% more expensive than the wired cameras, I'd only recommend it for places that are hard to run the Cat-5e network cable to the DVR, but where it is easy to access 120V-AC or 12V-DC power.", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Delightful, mostly", "Author": "Chet \"chipchipchip\"", "ReviewID": "R1XTNDQRUL9NK0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A delightful little wireless home security camera.  Great clarity, color, frame rate, infra-red, and transmission range.  Exceedingly suitable for purpose (anywhere-to-base in my small home).I took off a star because you can't stop the signal-strength icon from being present in the actual video image at the RCA connectors.  I capture from those, in my home-made system; I don't have Samsung's back-end gear.It's a little bars-and-antenna icon, showing you the signal strength.  At the RCA outputs.  Of the video footage itself.  At all times.  Seriously, it's always there.  In the raw footage.  No way to remove it.  I mean, you'd only need during placement, I would think, if even then, wouldn't you?  But, then again, you really don't even need it then, do you...  Cause, well, I mean, if you have video, then obviously you have signal.  If you don't, you don't.  Isn't that enough to tell?  And if you don't have video, because you don't have signal, then you can't see the stupid icon anyway!  Right?  Am I missing something?  But okay, let's suppose that maybe it showed you interesting things that you can't really be sure of when you're evaluating the *effects* of weak but still connective signal... say, framerate, or compression density... oh, but there's no cute little picture for that, I guess.  Morons.But, all in all, it's a fantastic little camera, especially for the price.  Almost certainly not useful in a commercial setting, but none I've found in this price range and purpose are nearly as good for my needs.  I'm considering deploying more of them, if I can get over myself about the icon thing.  As it is, I find myself changing its location when the need to watch a particular \"hot spot\" comes up -- it's that convenient -- which is surprising and delightful.  And, to be clear, it truly is solid -- I have to actually work at it to get artefacts or disconnections.  Never happens in normal use.Beyond the connection, the picture is far better than expected.  Let's face it, though, the bar is low.  I've seen some seriously crappy wireless cameras out there.  One blew up.  Outright.  That's right, it blew up.  In my face.  Smoke and everything!  But this one just plain works(tm), and provides every bit as usefully good a picture (for me) as my hard-wired cams.  The transmitted frame rate is perfectly fine, too; watching \"live\" on the RCA outputs looks quite natural.  And the microphone's sound is certainly, well, satisfactory.If I had a Samsumg system, I wonder, could I disable the irritating signal strength icon in all of my footage?  Could I, or should I, ask someone who has a Samsung system, to perhaps plug in my camera and see if they can turn it off from there?  Because, seriously... that's the only thing.  And it's maddening!But, other than that one little thing... it's absolutely wonderful.Get one, if you didn't know that anal-retentive was spelled with a hyphen.", "Date": "June 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works fine close by BUT.....and the brackets are junk.", "Author": "David William", "ReviewID": "R2CIFP9UAHQVUJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Camera works fine close by but if you move it 25-30 feet away it just goes in and out of range.
