Parish", "ReviewID": "RUYD1O2DKVKOE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The monitors provide a nice picture but the two attachment fixtures are poorly made.  I could not get the monitor to mount using the provided attachments.  They are flimsy and do not adjust easily.  I used hot glue to attach the monitor to the dash.  So far, I really like the color picture and it is surprisingly clear.  I have not tried them at night yet.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$27.59", "Features": "5\" digital color TFT LCD monitor\n2 ways to install it\nHigh-resolution picture\nthe monitor will start up automatically", "Name": "5 Inch TFT LCD Car Color Rear View Monitor Parking Backup Camera DVD + 2 Bracket", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ndCq-st2L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00EE7EXVW"}}
