( screws not included )-Good night vision / IR ( 700 TVL... maybe not, see below ) Seems to show my IR flood light better then the other camera's good IR LED's-Has a slightly wider field of view then my old cameras.Con:-\"Blue\" Led's are still 850nm (red)-Picture quality is possibly slightly better then my 480 TVL that came with my system... ( really they look the same but if you stare at the static long enough maybe there is a slight difference. maybe...-After i first hung this up for testing it needed to be \"rebooted\" the camera went dead but a pull of the power and wait 5 seconds it was going again. ( this seems to be the first and only time this has happened so far... )-You can see a feral in the back of the unit an you can push the cord in and out ( I did not take it apart but a little glue / silicone would have secured this..Other:FYI - This is an labeled as an indoor camera-The camera seemed easily adjustable once secured to the wall.( almost too easy ) To make it a little more snug I used some electrical tape around the camera and put it back in its housing. this really helped tighten up the installation.I don't think I will send it back, but i'm not going to get another one either. if your looking for an on par 30.00 camera here you go. if you wanted that high speed low drag 700 TVL at 30.00 keep looking...if it dies i'll let you know.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Color off, maybe 700 line but had to tell.", "Author": "Keith Renn", "ReviewID": "R3E5RM8VBST4Q4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "OK for the price.
