The real beauty of this product is its simplicity.  Push a button and talk. It does not have wires nor does it need to be plugged into a wall so it is truly portable.  I miss the volume control of the older model, the level on this one is a bit low but it does do the trick for simple communication.  I just wish it would work with my one remaining old Chaimberlain which I think was the best ever made.", "Date": "September 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Poor design", "Author": "E.

The long delay from the time you push the button untl you can talk is confusing to a non-techy person. The fact that the initial \"beep\" after pushing the button is only on the talking side doesn't help the listening/recipient to know to listen. If both push the button too cloes in sequence, no one hears anything. \"Walkie Talkies\" from the 70s were easier to use, which is essentially what these are with a long delay before you can actually talk. No volume adjustment; also difficult for an elderly person. Not worth sending back because by the time the customer pays full price shipping, you might as well find another use...or throw them out. Not weather proof...resistent perhaps. Each takes 4 AA batteries. Might as well be a 9 volt battery. Sad.", "Date": "October 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Poor range & no doorbell included", "Author": "J.
