{"Reviews": [{"Title": "(2.5 stars) Some good ideas, but didn't work well in practice overall", "Author": "Snap, Crackle and Pop", "ReviewID": "R1PSNB760HL99L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "When I got our first video monitor, I wondered if it would be useful, or just a gimmick, or one more way to worry about the baby!  We've found it very useful.  There are just some things that an audio monitor can't tell you. And being able to check on your child without the disturbance of going into her room can save a lot of trouble, especially in the transition times in the evening and in the morning, when little disturbances can lead to bigger ones.The video was especially useful when our child was a little older and moving around more, and we had left her to settle herself - which sometimes can seem like crying herself to sleep! :-(  We used the video monitor to see if she was just unsettled (so we very much did not want to go into the room, or she wouldn't learn to settle herself) or had gotten into a spot she couldn't get out of (stuck in the bars of the crib, or lost her lovey, so we needed to go in and set things right).  Video monitors are also useful to see when a child is awake, and how awake - sitting, standing, lying down or trying to climb out of bed! - or on her way to sleep, or not.  And they can be lots of fun, too, to watch and listen!Our other monitor is analog, and once in a while we'd hear our neighbor talking on their cordless phone - which no doubt means they hear us sometimes!  A digital monitor, like the Levana, should be private and static-free.So, I really wanted to like this product.  Plus, I really needed it when a new baby arrived.  But while it has an attractive design and some interesting features, the Levana Babyview monitor doesn't seem especially workable or useful for us.The main issue, of course, is the video and audio quality.  Both are problematic on the Levana BabyView:Video:  The video quality seems barely adequate.  The resolution on the baby's face is OK, but just.  The frame rate seems too low - you don't get anything like continuous motion.  Every several seconds, the video freezes.  From time to time, it freezes for a much longer time.  The video compression used results in a blocky, low resolution quality, though luckily that primarily affects low-contrast areas. Overall it's tolerable but not especially enjoyable to use, and lower quality most of the time than our analog monitor.Audio:  The audio had a persistent high pitched background whine when it was on.  Also, it's apparently set to switch off and on at low volumes, so the audio is intermittent with lots of clicks, which is less than useful and more than irritating.  The tiny microphone is in an odd location on the camera, it almost seems like an afterthought, perhaps that's part of the problem.  Overall, much lower quality than our analog monitor.Further, the user should be able to better control the audio - have a microphone that picks up even low level sounds, and have a volume control on the handset that you can adjust; then the user can decide what to hear.  Good quality audio can add a lot of information to how the child is doing.  You don't want to lose audio quality to get video - a monitor like this should have good quality audio and video.Some aspects of the Babyview are well done:- The design is fairly attractive and compact.  (Handset is 5.8\" H with the antenna x 1\" deep without the clip x 2.5\" wide.)- The 2.3\" screen is reasonably large.- The auto-switching between regular light and night vision seems to happen quickly and effectively.- The lithium ion battery in the handset is the best battery technology, in terms of power for the weight.  (It's what's used in digital cameras and cell phones.)  They claim over 4 hours of battery life.- The power adapters work at US or international voltages.- The included clamp for the camera is well made and seems likely to work well in a variety of setups.Other features are good ideas that don't work well in practice:- The voice activation feature, which leaves the screen and the sound off until it picks up some sound, helps conserve battery and perhaps parents' nerves and sleep.  But it needs too much noise to switch on - it's either set to too low a level, or the microphone isn't sensitive enough.  And again, this is something that the user should be able to adjust.- The little curved base is clever, but doesn't work that well at the optimum focal range of 5 feet. When placed on a dresser next to the crib with the camera is tilted down enough to see the baby, the base blocks a big part of the image.  In addition, when the camera is in the base, the camera starts to tilt due to the heavy filter on the power supply wire (a biggish black cylindrical part on the wire).  So for both those reasons, the cute clever magnetic base isn't much use in practice.Some of the features seem potentially nice but I'm not sure I'd use them - such as the nightlight and the music.  I almost wonder if they added them to distinguish this product from their security cameras.Finally, there are a couple elements of the design that aren't so great.  Having a bright green power LED on the front of the camera is thoughtless on a baby monitor, though luckily it's easy enough to tape over (and there are so many lovely colors of electrical tape these days).  And the glowing red night vision lights seem to have too much potential for distracting or even upsetting a child.The wireless frequency is 2.4ghz, the same as wireless internet and some cordless phones.  The Levana has enough channels (32, with auto signal hopping) that intereference shouldn't be a major problem, but I can't definitely evaluate that at this point.The company's website is [...], though there's very little info there.  Their parent company is SVAT Electronics, which makes security cameras and the like.  So even though this is a new product from an unknown brand, they do have experience with this sort of thing.  Perhaps their next generation of this product will have some of the wrinkles ironed out.", "Date": "November 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good reception/decent video quality.

like a pretty hefty task. The Levana Babyview20 *INTERFERENCE FREE* Digital Wireless Video Monitor does a good job carrying a consistent signal; I haven't experienced any major freezes or losing video signal. However, I did notice some very brief pause when there's fast motion during night vision, but it is very brief.The night vision works very well. The camera contains 9 infrared lights. In the dark, you can actually see it glowing red, but it is pretty dim (the green power LED is brighter); hopefully, that's not something that would scare the baby at night. You can see the actual infrared lights during the video I've uploaded, but it is actually not that bright; that is how the digital camera sees it -- not to the human eye. But from the video, you can just get an idea of how much infrared lights are in there. According to Levana, the infrared lights are 100% safe to the baby.There is a VOX (Voice Operated eXchange) feature, which allows the monitor to be off and only turns on when there is sound detected (for example when the baby starts crying) on the camera. This is a nice feature, but it would have been nice to be able to adjust the sound sensitivity to even detect lower sounds.The monitor comes with a rechargeable Lithium-ion battery. According to Levana, it takes 3 hours to fully charge; blue LED means it is charging and when it goes off, it means fully charged. The camera requires four AAA batteries (not included) if you don't connect it to an AC adapter. Levana claims the camera can operate for 4.5 continuous hours with AAA batteries. (and about half if you use the night light) So obviously, it's best to have an outlet nearby the camera to use the AC instead or be sure to buy some rechargeable AAA batteries.On the left side of the monitor, it has a PLAY/STOP, NEXT, and VOX button.On the right side of the monitor, it has ON/OFF dial (which also controls the volume), and BRIGHTNESS UP/DOWN button above it. The power adapter jack is also on the right side bottom.Below the LCD screen, it shows the POWER/LINK/VOX/MUSIC indicator; there's also an audio level indicator between them with green LEDs. And of course, there's the speaker below it.That's all it is. It is really basic and simple.* Takes about 3 seconds for the monitor to turn on* There's four levels of brightness.* 3 lullabies can be played on the camera. You can play/stop/next from the monitor.* There is a Night Light switch on the camera, which just turns on three star-shaped lights on the camera.* The camera comes with two mounts. One is for clamping on a crib and the other is a magnetic cradle. The cradle is actually pretty nice, which will allow you to rotate the camera in many directions freely with ease.Careful with the magnetic cradle! The magnet is pretty strong, so you'll want to keep sensitive electronics, especially hard drives away from it.Sure, in today's HD world, it'd be nice to have everything in great quality. However, higher quality videos will obviously take higher bandwidth to transmit and more battery power. The video quality is pretty much what one would expect with low-end/average webcam. It's not horrible, but you have to be realistic. Overall, it's decent since you can still tell what you're looking at.Pros:- Good range for around the house (100-150ft)- Have not lost any reception.- Design is fit for a baby's room.- Pretty close to real-time (about approx 0.5 second delay - not a major big deal)- Night Vision works great.- Night light- Monitor can be clipped on to your belt or as a stand- Comes with two AC adapters for powering camera or charging monitor- Basic, very simple to use.Cons- No color adjustments; you get what you get. (webcam quality)- Could use wider lens to see surroundings. (perhaps have an add-on to attach easily to screw on to the lens)- There should be a button on the monitor to turn on/off the night light.- The camera could use rechargeable lithium batteries like the monitor.- Should be able to adjust sound sensitivity for VOX- Would be really nice to have an automatic panning/zooming capability- Sound can echo.I give this product a 3 1/2 stars, but will be a bit lenient and give it a 4, since I have not tested other baby monitors.", "Date": "November 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "So frustrating!", "Author": "T.

Hansen", "ReviewID": "R2W7EXQ1IVMI4D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Levana Babyview20 is definitely not a unique idea, but the way its been implemented could be considered unique. How many of us want to see and listed to our babies? My wife just recently had our second child, so testing out this product was easy.In addition to being just a regular video monitor, the Babyview20 offers music, a night light, night vision, and nearly static-free audio (overall, not bad). Both the monitor and the camera can run off of batteries, although power adapters are included.When we first setup the unit and tested it out, we were quite pleased with the quality. Since our daughter is so young, we simply placed the camera in her bassinet. If your child is older, you can use the included attachment to attach the camera to a crib-side. Overall, quality was good, we could hear her breathe, and all was well. Setup was definitely a breeze.During subsequent uses, however, we ran into some issues. The monitor started to lose its connection to the camera. Flipping off the monitor and turning it back on, powering the monitor with the power adapater, and even switching batteries in the camera didn't make a difference. I was forced to call Levana, which offered very friendly customer support. I was told to simply hold the \"VOX\" button (which is a mode that will only turn the monitor on if audio comes from the camera) and hold down the night vision button on the camera. After doing this, lo and behold, things started working again. Either way, if you run into the issue, hopefully this can help prove to be useful.In the end, a great product that was executed very well. It's not perfect by any means (the music could sound better, for one), but, considering this appears to be Levana's second product, I think they've, hands down, got a winner.UPDATE: After about a week of writing this review, I've had nothing but trouble with the camera and monitor. It keeps loosing its connection, and, despite the advice they gave me above, I haven't been able to get it to work. Also, before, there wasn't much static coming through the monitor, now it has a constant noise coming through it despite my daughter sleeping.", "Date": "November 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "better to buy the summer infant best view.. please read Why.....", "Author": "Happy mom \"M\"", "ReviewID": "R1B1ZQRJVODZ8A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this product first because 1) price 2) lullaby 3) supposed to be interference free.Then I bought summer infant best view 2.5' display one for my mom's house.

I must first say that I demand certain features to work flawlessly due to my 7 year old daughter who suffers with a severe seizure disorder.  A video baby monitor is our eyes to watch over her when she is sleeping in her bedroom during the day and night.  The Levana fell very short for our needs.Pros:  I can only come up with one positive feature and that is the picture quality.Cons: (there are a few)1. The monitor automatically puts the audio to sleep every 4 seconds and does not always wake up.  Only loud noises will wake up the audio once it goes to sleep.  There is no option to force the audio to always be on.2. The monitor made a very loud buzzing noise whether the volume level was low or high.  The buzzing was louder than trying to listen to my daughter breathing. Not acceptable.3. The monitor's screen had a bright flash/ pulse every 3-4 seconds common among other brands as well.  This is quite annoying during the night in a dark room.4. The manufacturer claims the camera to be portable.  But you need to unscrew the back cover and put in non-rechargeable AAA batteries.  Then to hook up the camera to the power cord for overnight monitoring, the batteries need to be removed.  Somewhat of a hassle.I must say that with my specific demands, I cannot recommend this monitor to a parent with perfectly healthy infants or children.

I loved the colors, the styling and the way the camera sits on a magnetic base (worked really well for sitting on my old radiator cover!).  The problem is...well, you guessed it - the same thing everyone else complains about.1) The sound should not cut in and out.  As many people have said, that would be find if the sound cuts out when the baby is asleep, but my baby can be talking or singing and there's NO sound!  NONE!  It takes it awhile before it kicks back on.  More annoying than anything.  The Summer model has excellent sound, and it is continuous (the monitor part will shut off as a power saving feature when it's unplugged though).2) The incessant \"buzz\" of the monitor.  Ugh.  I really thought I'd get over it, but I couldn't.  Why the heck does it have to buzz like that?  The Summer model does not have a buzz at ALL.  The sound is very good.3) Image quality - it's just \"meh\".  The Summer model is SO much better!When you compare the handsets, the Levana wins on style and weight; it's so cute and easily portable.

It should get 5 stars.  For my purposes, it gets 4 stars.  For many other people, it would get only 3 stars.  I'm grading it a 4 for now**  [Note that I have have changed my rating and my review.  See asterisks below].First off, the Levana monitor works wonderfully.  It allows me to check in on my sleeping son (in his crib on the 2nd floor) while I'm watching TV in the basement.  His mother goes to bed earlier than I do, so I get the early shift for tending for our son.The pros is that is has a clear picture with no noise, and the infrared camera allows us to watch him in the dark.  It even has a useful feature called 'vox'. When set, it serves as a noise-level trigger that will turn the monitor on when a preset threshold is reached.One minor note is that there is about a half-second latency.  This is noticeable when I'm using another baby monitor, but no big deal.What could be a big deal (and #1 is a big deal for me, hence 4 stars) are the next 3.  #2 and #3 might affect others more than it affects me.(1) Interferes with WiFi(2) click sound(3) constant hum when on.*(4) Will not stand on end*(5) Sound cuts out.#1 - is self explanatory.  We sometimes lose our signal and have to turn off the monitor.#2 - as some have noted, it randomly makes a loud click sound.  It doesn't bother me, as I'm in the basement watching TV, but I'd hate to have this next to the bed.#3 - there is constant hum when it is turned on that is unaffected by the volume level.  Again, I'm watching TV, so this is no big deal, but it might annoy sleepers that are sensitive to noise.*#4 - very annoying, as I can not stand the baby monitor on end and have it standing upright on a table.  It may look like it is flat, but the bottom is not.  I have to lean the monitor against something to keep it upright.  If there is nothing to lean it against, then I lean it against a table leg on the floor, and the floor is not where I want a video baby monitor.*#5 - As others have reported, the sounds cuts out intermittently or doesn't work.  I use a low-tech audio monitor to monitor the sound.If they could fix those 3[5] things, this would easily be a 5.  Or maybe just a 4.5, as I accidentally hit one of the lullaby buttons one night, which remotely turned on the song-and-dance.

For the past two years, I've been using the Bebe Sounds Angel Care Monitor, which I love. However, he's recently started coughing at night, and after the doc said his throat was fine, I decided to get a video monitor to see what was going on. Was it from drinking the sippy cup of water he has in his room at night while lying down, or was he sick (turns out, it's allergies), but I wanted to know. After much research and review reading, I chose this monitor. I don't hate it, but I certainly don't love it. And I DEFINITELY wouldn't recommend it to first time parents in the market for a monitor for their soon-to-be-born baby.My main complaint is the sound. It doesn't stay on all the time. This really threw me off since, with a traditional monitor, you can always hear what's going on in babys room. With the Levana, when you turn the unit on, the sound comes on initially, then cuts out. It'll only come back on if the speaker on the camera detects a sound in the room (like baby crying or coughing). This made me very nervous, especially since it didn't come on for everything. I still keep my Bebe Sounds monitor plugged in, and occasionally I'll hear him cough or sneeze, or quietly talking to himself over it, but the Levana didn't pick it up. I actually thought I had a faulty unit till I read the other reviews.Strike two came the second morning of using it. I heard over my regular monitor my son wake up. He usually plays quietly in his room for about an hour before he's ready to start his day. I turned on the video monitor, and the screen was completely white. I tried everything...took the battery out, plugged it into the wall, turned it on and off a million times. Nothing. Since I knew what he was doing in his room, I just plugged it into the charge (which it didn't need since I hadn't had it on all night) and let it be. And hour later I turned it back on and it worked fine. It did that TWO mornings in a row. Unacceptable if this is your only monitor.Overall, I say PASS. While set up was easy, and the actual image on the screen is of great quality, the unit itself is just too unreliable. It serves MY purpose, which was just to have a back-up monitor with a camera, but I still feel the need to keep my original monitor plugged in. If I had starting using this when my son was first born, I would have returned it immediately and bought a better model. New parents...save yourself the trouble.

When mounting the camera on a crib rail while your baby is still small, the neck of the camera is very floppy.  If it were made of something like \"the snake\", where you could easily position and rotate the direction the camera is facing, it would be MUCH more convenient.  As it is currently, you have to place your baby's face in a precise spot in order to see it on the viewing screen.  Otherwise, you get a video shot of an elbow...something that makes the video function pretty useless.  When it is positioned properly, it is WONDERFUL to be able to see if those little eyes have drifted off (or back) to sleep yet.Another point I will make is that once the monitor is on, it glows quite a bit.  I find this quite distracting when I place it on my bedstand at night.  Even with the continuous feed video turned off, the handheld portion gives off a fairly bright blue glow.  I put black electrical tape around certain portions so it doesn't disturb my sleep as much.Otherwise, I love this monitor.  The fact that it is silent unless your baby is making noise is very conducive to my good night's sleep.  I would recommend it - especially for such a fair price.

The angle created by placing it on a table nearby cuts off half of the baby view.It won't mount properly to a co-sleeper.3. The handheld unit has a rechargeable battery only; there's no place to put regular batteries -  so you can't travel with it if you are going somewhere without electricity (like camping).4. This unit has really poor reception between the camera and the handheld part. I live in a small apartment, and if the units can't \"see\" each other the camera constantly drops the signal - and makes a very annoying \"dropped signal\" noise to boot! This is my 6th video baby monitor and the only one that I've ever had this problem with.5. The volume level is really low - I can only hear the baby if the volume is all the way up AND there's no other extraneous apartment noise (i.e. tv, AC, even conversation! etc.)6. The volume sound is very echo-ey.Conclusion: While there is no perfect video monitor, this is by far the worst one I've gotten.

They no longer advertise that it has a camera clamp other than the magnetic base, so you do get what they claim, its just that this same product used to have it so I was still expecting it.Also to let you know- our monitor broke.

Make sure to place the camera pretty close to your baby in order to make sure the voice activated feature of the monitor kicks in, as the speaker's sensitivity is not too high. The clamp device for the camera works fine, you may even be able to clip it onto a shelf instead of the crib depending on how close your shelf is. It also has a magnetic base if you have something magnetic to stick it on.I really like the VOX feature which turns on your handheld monitor only when it senses sounds near the camera. This saves the batteries in the camera, if you are using batteries. Both the camera and monitor can be plugged in to the wall if you don't want to use batteries.Regarding the picture, contrary to the advertisements, you will not get a \"clear\" picture of your baby. You will get an adequate picture though, and that is all you need in a monitor. I really like the night vision feature-you do not need some bright night light to get an image.

As someone else wrote, the ideas are good in theory, but not in practice.  Interference free means that the monitor automatically changes channels when it detects interference which apparently happened every few seconds in our house. It also has a voice activated feature in which the camera only picks up sound when it reaches a certain preset level.  Once that noise level is reached the sound is great, but when it changes channels (you don't always know it's doing this), it either resets to where it has to be noise activated or the monitor and camera get out of synch.Putting it all together:When it changes channels and switches to voice activated mode, the noise has to be pretty loud in order to activate it (like a loud speaking voice) and there is a slight delay.  I didn't like this because I want to know when he's awake even if he's not crying or being loud. The picture doesn't seem to be affected when this happens.Sometimes when it would switch channels, the camera and monitor would get out of synch in which case you don't get any sound from the monitor (the voice activation does not work) and the picture may be frozen as well.  You have to go into the child's room and push buttons on the camera in order to resynch...I think you can see why this would be a problem, especially as often as it was happening with us.  The customer service rep I talked to said that even a neighbor's wireless connection could cause interference, so even if you don't have any devices that run on the same frequency, this could be a problem.All that said...When the monitor was working well, it was great.

And, for something as important as baby's safety, we expect not only quality, but reliability and functionality.Here's the downside to this review: I have not had experience with any other baby monitors, and we don't have a baby yet. This was tested purposely on each other (and our pets), with relation to sound, reception, etc.I won't go into all the features it includes, and will instead skip to my review of each one.Design: Appealing. Neutral color of a pastel lime green. Not my favorite color, but it should fit with any blues or pinks of usual baby rooms. I thoroughly enjoyed the magnetic base - it was very easy to position the angle of the camera. But, towards the battery compartment, the magnetism weakens, and even the manual notes to watch out for this.Size: Great! Camera isn't obtrusive, even while mounted. Monitor fits nicely in your hand with a good size screen. You can mount the camera on its stand, the crib (with the incl. kit), or upon a wall. The hand-held monitor can be hung by its belt clip, or flip the clip and it's now a stand. (I really like double-usage.)Video Quality: Good. (Cheaper monitors are probably lower quality, so I took into consideration that more expensive monitors should have awesome video.) The range was pretty amazing. We have a two-story home and it didn't drop the video even when I was downstairs or outside. It did get more choppy at those distances though. One reviewer mentioned not seeing anything like continuous motion, but my experience differed: I was able to watch my tank of fish with fluidity.Audio Quality: Subpar. Audio cut out often and entirely dropped once I moved downstairs. The VOX feature, where you can have the monitor only turn on when sound was detected, was a nice idea. But, it should have an option to change the sensitivity. We had placed our camera facing a tank of fish, and the sound of the filter would cut in and out. I would walk into the room and clap my hands - the monitor would sometimes turn on. It seemed as though the camera settled in to realize what was considered \"ambient noise,\" but didn't always turn on when a louder event occurred.My husband did go in the room and \"cry,\" while I went into another room on the same floor. The VOX feature turned the monitor on and I could clearly hear the \"crying.\" But, the audio did cut in and out a little, while the video remained strong.This VOX option seemed to be the most important feature in dealing with a baby monitor, so I was disappointed that it didn't work consistently. But, I didn't hear any interference, which Levana seems to push. Kudos to them.Oh! If you don't use the VOX option and just continually have the monitor turned on, there is always a humming noise. Constantly. Well, unless the sound cuts out. Then it's quiet.Night Vision: Great; quality was just dandy, video didn't cut out. I watched my cat, my husband, my fish - all in a completely darkened room. The red LEDs are not bright, so I wouldn't worry much about a baby or child being bothered by them.Nightlight: Um, cute stars, but fairly useless in illuminating anything but the camera's body.Music: Three lullabies are available to play in low quality sound. The quality seemed worse than some toys I've come across. If this had the option to load my own mp3s, that would've been amazing!PROS: Video Quality, Design and Size, Certain Features, Very Easy SetupCONS: Audio Reception, Intermittent VOX, Crap Music, Second-Story HousesI give it 3.5 stars.

I registered for this monitor for my baby shower, and received it from one of my best friends.  For about a year, it was great.  We had no problems, and loved the 'voice-activation' feature (which was why we chose this product over others) and being able to check in on our baby without disturbing her.  I even recommended it to friends who were in the process of registering for their showers.The problems started when our daughter was 11 months old.  The monitor would no longer hold a charge, and after some investigation, it appeared that the pin in the monitor had broken off.  I called Levana, and first they tried to tell me that since I had the monitor for over a year (the shower was a couple months before I gave birth, and my friend bought the monitor a few weeks before the shower), the warranty was not valid, but I was welcome to purchase a new product from their website.  I called and explained the situation again, that although the monitor had been purchased over a year ago, we hadn't even been using it for a year, and I would be happy to send them our daughter's birth certificate if that would be of any help.  They then tried to tell me that even if it was within the year, this was not a manufacturer's defect, so it wouldn't be covered.  I then told them that the problem was INSIDE the monitor-- what kind of defect would that be classified as?  Finally, I threatened to leave a negative review on Amazon, and all of a sudden my wish was granted and they sent a new monitor.  (By the way, the new monitor had a modified charger which would prevent the pin from breaking-- so this was a problem they knew about but still tried to tell me it was not a manufacturing defect).All's good, right?  Wrong-- we get the new monitor, set it up, turn it on and there is an AWFUL high pitched noise coming from the monitor (the part with the video?  That you would have on your nightstand when sleeping at night?).  I immediately contacted Levana again and told them of this problem.  They told me to try re-linking it, this didn't work, then they continued to stall, answering other questions I had but not addressing this HUGE problem, or altogether ignoring my calls and emails.  I finally contacted them again this morning, and I got an almost immediate reply.  I thought to myself, \"Yay!  We finally will be able to use the monitor again!\"-- NOPE!  Their reply was that this was an environmental problem due to interference with some other electronics we have in our home, and that they have discontinued this model, so they wouldn't be able to do anything anyway, but I was welcome to upgrade (for $150) to a newer model.  NONE of this response makes any sense:1) I already had this monitor in our home and we did not experience the high pitched noise- so how is this an environmental problem?2) If the model is discontinued, then why is it still for sale from Levana through Amazon? (Buyer beware-- if they are no longer replacing defective products, not a good idea to buy!!)3) WHY ON EARTH would I purchase another Levana product after this horrible experience?I deeply regret those recommendations I gave to friends to but this product.

We've never used any other monitor and have found the levana to be a lifesaver.The video/audio monitor provides the perspective we need to know whether to respond to her cries or not, and even provides good entertainment now that she's beginning to crawl around her crib!  So often I would have ran to her crib but thankfully I can watch her and have confidence to let her fuss herself to sleep rather than burst into her room.  The adjustible sound is great so we can have it turned up if friends are over or turned down as it sits next to our bed at night.  Also convenient is the VOX option so the babysitter/grandma can obsessively watch the video while mom/dad just turn the VOX on and carry-on with our night.Two very minor concerns: the click sound when any sound arises in her room - such as a car driving by her window.

We had never used a monitor before and actually bought it for our nanny when we were out of town.

Our \"baby\" is 20 months old so I don't use it all the time, just when I want to check in before bed or to see when she wakes in the morning.  Overall, the receiver is great (I was initially worried about the small size but have found that it is just fine and the size of it is convenient) and I do not find that it has static as other posters mentioned.The best part about this monitor is that it doesn't work on frequency so your privacy is maintained and you don't pick up signals from other homes.  I don't really use any of the other features like music or VOX.

They must have had a defective unit.I've been using our Levana monitro about a year and a half and have never had any of these issues.When the room is dark, the monitor only shows what the night vision shows.  In realy time, good quality.  Since our daughter turned into a toddler and began to move around, we've attached the clamp to the top curtain rod so we can see the entire mattress.  From that height, we can see her eyes(strangely reflective when her eyes are open, due to the night vision).  We can't see if she is smiling or giving some detailed facial expression, but we can see if she's moving her mouth, if her eyes are open or closes(most of the time).  In short, there is easily enough image quality and detail that we can not only see that she is safe and okay, but we sometimes sit and watch the monitor for fun and see how she talks to the tiny red light that is on the camera.The sound is good.  It is made so that parents can hear the louder sounds, which I guess is meant to wake parents who use the monitor all through the night.  Otherwise, quiet sounds are not transmitted.  I have wished that it would just have a mode to transmit all sounds, just so that I could hear her babble.  Mostly, we keep the sound off and just use the video.  When she's crying and trying to settle herself down, we can hear all of that just fine with out any monitor.  We just want to see her and make sure she's okay.We only have the monitor on as she's going to sleep and then use it to check on her, rather than opening her door and risk waking her.The only time the monitor makes noise is when the battery gets low and is close to dying.  It just gets loud and staticky sounding and, after a few minutes dies.Having the monitor on no more than an hour each day, we only charge it about once per week, if not less frequently.After a year and a half of use, I'm pleased with the battery life and the overall quality of this monitor.It has a few bells and whistles which we don't use, like remote music you can turn on from the monitor, to play through the camera.  We tried the music once and our daughter just screamed louder, so that was the first and last time for that trick!When we turn the monitor on when her room is light, we're always suprised to be reminded that it is a color camera and monitor.  We mostly use it at night and the night vision is--well--night vision.It would be cool if there was a sound setting to have it just be on and hear everything.  And it would be cool if we could zoom.  And it would be reaaaaally cool if we could remotely move the camera to different views, but if it had all of those bells and whistles, we probably would never be able to afford it.

We are all having the same issues:-The buzzing/squelching sound even when the volume is turn all the downThis means you can't have it on in your bedroom when you are trying to sleep because it just buzzes.  And when I switch it on to check on the baby the noise wakes up my husband.  It's just terrible.-My babies cries don't register on it until he's been screaming for a while.  This defeats any hope of catching him when he's only slightly waking up to get to him to shush back to sleep.One thing I haven't seen people complain about yet is the fact that the charger cords have a transformer near the top of them.  This drags the camera off of the edge of the crib or the cabinet if you are only using the magnetic base.  If you can't anchor it down it will drop.  If the battery life on it lasted more than 5 hours this wouldn't be an issue, we could just sit it on the base without the cord and put it anywhere which is what we thought we could do by the companies photos and description.  misleading.The Summer one is the way to go.

The moment we received this monitor and test it, we noticed already that the sound comes in and out. Since we cannot find this at any of our local stores, we decide to live with it since we only use it for naps (our baby's crib is in our room).So basically our video monitor only has video but not reliable sound, and then after a couple months, the video started to go too. The video quality got so bad I can hardly make out my baby's face!  I called Levana support and the operator sounded like she did not believe the video quality has problems, told me a couple of times that I need APPROVAL FROM THEM before I can pay for the shipping to send it back and wait up to 6 weeks for them to test it. I asked them what am I gonna do without a baby monitor for 6 weeks, and they basically told me it was my problem. Soon after that, even the poor quality video went in and out.  So we gave up and pay another $200 for a new summer infant bestview monitor and call our internet provider to reroute the cable so to minimize the interference with our wireless router.  We're extremely happy with the summer infant monitor, the sound quality is excellent and we love that we can remote control the camera and zoom to look for our baby without going in her room. (she rolls around a lot!)I read some really good reviews of this product before I made the purchase, and I believe that had I got one that works, I'll be quite happy too. So buyers be warned, if you buy this and has problems, you'll need to get approval, pay for shipping, purchase an additional monitor while you wait for them to test it and decide whether they are going to fix the alleged problem.

In fact, it has a few feature that you might not expect - such as the ability to play lullabies directly through the camera.Pros-- Voice Activated - will turn-on when the camera detects noise or movement- Will play lullabies through the camera and is controlled through the monitor- Awesome mounting brackets and swivels - trust me - this may save you a lot of grief in positioning your camera.- Manual night light- The monitor has built-in rechargeable batteries- Monitor is small and light enough to be clipped to a belt- You can control the brightness of the display screen on the monitor.Features not present- Will only support one camera- No A/V output (again on units that have A/V outputs I have never used the feature).- I have had some issues with range, but I think it is more likely caused by something within our home - since the unit works in 95% of our house (and some nights we have no issue at all). Note - most of the other reviewer's have not had an issue with range.- The color response is not great, but this is not that big of a deal. The main is that you can see your child in both well lit and dark conditions.Final verdict - the BabyView 20 is a feature rich and reasonably priced. It certainly is worth consideration for your nursery!4 Stars- Please note - I was provided one unit from the manufacturer for review purposes -----", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pulsating Night Vision; Choppy Audio", "Author": "Fish \"Fish\"", "ReviewID": "R1UV3BD94FZ61Q", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The night vision feature on this monitor is pretty bad - about every five seconds, you get a flash of bright white on the screen.

I could hear the baby crying through the walls before I could hear her through the monitor.Also - there's a \"VOX\" feature that supposedly turns the monitor on and off when noise is picked up.  That feature is VERY slow to kick in at the onset of crying or room noise.If you want to hear 100% of what's going on in the room, this monitor simply won't do it.FWIW, the video is very clear and the audio, when it actually comes through from time to time, was crystal clear.

All I had to do was plug in and wait til the handset was fully charged, then I turned on both camera and handset and it synced automatically by itself. Before receiving the monitor I was worried by some of the reviews. The quality is GREAT! I am not saying you can see every single particle but I can see everything that needs to be seen. Quality is great and the night vision works awesome! Every little noise made is heard loud and clear and also shows up with lights on the handset. From the handset you can turn on different lullabies. No you cannot turn the nighlight feature on from the monitor but for me there is no complaint there. You can adjust the picture on the monitor darker or lighter. Being able to charge both camera and handset is great, no constantly running through batteries. Also from reading other reviews people said there was a delay in video and it froze, I have no delay but of maybe half a second and the picture does not freeze. My baby will not sleep unless she is in someones arms or a deep sleep. I cannot leave her by herself so when I need to do homework I have to wait for someone to hold her. Tonight alone I have been able to do my homework and she has slept peacefully with me watching the whole time. This is the best monitor for me. If you do not require such things do not worry but for those who want to view and hear their child as well as they can without being in the room this is the monitor for you! Five stars all around!

However, the audio (music) it can play, well, is just an extra that really is unnecessary.The camera itself is pretty well built and sturdy enough to handle minor bumps and scrapes, so you can put it just about anywhere and rotate into the position you need.From a purely functional perspective as to what this product is (a baby monitor), and what it sets out to do (monitor the child), this is a good product.", "Date": "November 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Thoughtful, Convenient Design.

Colin McGraw \"AV, Computer & EnviroTech Nut\"", "ReviewID": "R2J56YWHCSUYY5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "You can tell Levana put a lot of thought into this webcam-quality video monitor's design. The long-lasting lithium ion battery in the handset runs strong where a cheaper NiMH battery would have failed. There's a belt clip on the back of the handset that conveniently rotates to become a stand to set for when you set the unit down. The \"VOX\" feature switches the unit off until your baby makes noise, conserving power. The \"night vision\" comes on automatically when it gets dark, making the feature effortless to use, and the button you press on the handset to start a lullaby actually put our baby to sleep after she started stirring (which wins the BABYVIEW20 HUGE bonus points).Still, a few minor issues keep it from being completely perfect. The magnetic base prevents the camera from being angled too far downward if positioned above the crib (though the crib mount works great), the weights on the power cord near the plug-in points of the devices sometimes end up tugging the units out of position, the lullaby you initiate with the handset keeps going until manual stoppage WITH said handset (no way to stop the music on the camera if you leave the handset behind) and the camera only picks up noises from several feet away, so you have to make sure you position it near your baby.All in all, the Levana BABYVIEW20 is an outstanding product, and highly recommended if you are in the market for a video baby monitor.

The helpfulness ended there.  I was quoted a 3-4 week turnaround time to receive a replacement monitor.  The only way to do it faster would have been to pay for a new one to be shipped to me and then receive a refund if/when the original was found to be defective.After 3 weeks I hadn't heard anything and called the company to check on the status of the replacement.  I was told that the monitor had just been tested and the replacement would ship out that day and I should receive it within a week.  When I received the replacement monitor, the box had been opened, indicating that it was a refurbished monitor.  I plugged it in and there was a constant humming/buzzing coming from the monitor that had not been present on the previous one.  I called the company (CWD) back, went through the troubleshooting steps with the representative on the phone, and was told to send it back.  I went through the exact same process again with the same 3 week wait time before calling to check on the status.  When I called, I was told that the monitor would ship out that very same day (which seems like you need to call the company to remind them that they are supposed to be shipping something to you.  I find it hard to believe that it is a coincidence that I happened to call twice, about two separate monitors, and just happened to be lucky enough to call on the day that each shipped out). I was also informed that they found nothing wrong with the monitor, no humming noise or anything, and that they were shipping the same one back to me.  After explaining that this was unacceptable and that the 2 months without a monitor was a complete inconvenience, they still sent the same monitor back to me and asked me to test it out in a neighbor or friend's house to see if the issue was interference.  I'm not sure exactly what that would solve, considering I don't live in those houses, and the first monitor did not have an intereference issue in my own house.I contacted Amazon and they honored a return even though it was well past their 30 day advertised policy.

My daughter is on the opposite side of the house so having this has been extremely helpful.I leave It charging during the day so is ready at night. What I like about it is that it turns on when the baby stirs, coughs, etc. Otherwise the screen is turned off. The button on the left, when pressed, gives you a live view of the baby. I love the night time feature in which I can see the baby in BW. What I have used the most is the lullabies. Sometimes my daughter stirs and I turn on the music from the handheld monitor and I can watch her go back to sleep. It can play one song or random which is the one I use. I don't like that the music is a little bit loud in her room, but at least is blocking out any other noises around her preventing her from going to sleep.Sometimes, the monitor goes out of range (don't know why) but it usually fixes itself up. Another small issue I have had is that sometimes the picture is so dark on the handheld monitor that I have had to go in the room and turn off/on the camera for it to reset.Those are the only issues I have had. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.EDITED June 2014- The monitor stopped working all together. I thought it was the battery, so I ordered a new one. It didn't work.

I already have a Foscam monitor for my older child but I wanted one that I could have a separate handset for my baby. This monitor does not work well for us. The night vision, while it allows you to see the baby just fine, tries to compensate constantly causing the monitor to flash every few seconds. This is very disturbing to a light sleeper. Additionally, if you use the VOX with the sound on, the monitor beeps every time it detects movement.Another note on the VOX is it is useless if you use a loudish fan like we do. We use the fan to help drown out noise in our baby's room but this fan sets off the sensor leaving the monitor on or beeping on every few seconds.My baby's room is next to mine and I still constantly get the \"out of range\" notification. If you use a cell phone near it, forget it.  I like the idea of the magnetic base but it does not seem to function as it's supposed to. Throughout the night, it would shift slightly and make it so that I couldn't see my baby at all. I would prefer if it had an attached base and even better, remote tilt/pan feature.Some positives: I actually do like the lullaby feature. However, I can use my iPod with the same effect.  I also appreciate the nightlight since my baby still wakes throughout the night and it's nice to be able to see without turning any lights on.

Sometimes it goes for a whole night without issue, other times it could happen about 6-10 times.Third, the hassle free VOX setting is nice, and works very well. A little too well. It's very sensitive, and will pick up low tones easily like a truck or train passing, or bass sounds from a different room. Better to be too sensitive than the other way around I guess.

We originally really loved this monitor and it worked great for about 6 months before we started having issues.Cons:f you bump it or drop it at all, which is inevitable with a toddler it will break. We dropped it once and the plastic case covering the antennae broke off leaving the image somewhat blurry. Also, after about 6 months the hand held device no longer worked unless it was plugged in. I tried to contact customer service about replacing the ion battery but was unable to get ahold of anyone.This only happened 2-3 times over the course of using it every night for 2 years, but a few times it just shut off in the middle of the night even though it was plugged in and fully charged. We are lucky we woke up to our child without the monitor.Pros:We never got an intercepted signal with a neighborStandby mode allows you to sleep, and the monitor only goes off if there is a change in noise. It blocks out white noise such as music or a fan which is AMAZING! Most monitors do not do this, normally whatever is playing in your baby's room is also playing on the monitor.  This feature shuts off the monitor's screen and audio. It will only turn back on when your child starts to cry or make noise. You will be immediately notified on the monitor you when your child starts to cry -- the LCD and audio will switch on. Seriously, this is almost worth the price of buying one just for your sanity's sake. You don't have to have the bright light of the monitor on all night and you don't have to listen to your child's music.Great night vision and a really great sized screenThere are built in night lights and songs, but I never used these.The camera itself rotates around so you can get the best view possible.Overall I think it was a pretty good product, but it did not last as long as I would have liked it to.

I very recently have a newfound passion for this monitor because we are expecting baby #2 and we bought a Lorex LW 2451 to test out monitoring two rooms via two cameras in one monitor, and we were just horrified by the allegedly superior Lorex, and it made us appreciate this simple Levana even more. Overall, this is just a very sturdy, very consistent, very reliable monitor that transmits very well.Pros:- Monitors and transmits ALL OF THE SOUND in the room. This is CRITICAL to us. Fancier monitors like the Lorex LW2451 do this weird thing where they equalize to the background level of sound, set that to be \"quiet\" and then only transmit sound that is louder than that background. This was HIGHLY problematic for us because we use a white noise machine in the baby's room, and the Lorex wouldn't transmit the baby's cries unless she was crying louder than the white noise machine, which meant she was crying for a minute before it transmitted. This DOES NOT happen with the Levana - the Levana transmits it all. So, I hear the constant whoosh of the white noise, AND I hear every little peep my baby makes. So, I'd give this a \"win\" for sensitivity.- Display is quite clear enough to determine if your baby needs your intervention.- Battery life is great - we just plug it in overnight, but we keep it unplugged for naptime monitoring.- Lullabyes are cute. We used to use this sometimes when she was littler. Didn't end up using it too much, but they work.- Excellent range. We live in a 2100 sq ft upstairs/downstairs house and have not had signal problems despite there being about 4 or 5 thick walls in between her room and our living room. Also does not interfere with WiFi in our experience.- Comes with a very nice clamp attachment, so we keep it clamped up high on a lamp pole... no need to wall-mount.Cons:- No way to communicate with the baby. This isn't a big deal to me, but initially I thought it'd be nice to let her know we're on our way to get her.- No way to completely turn off monitor while leaving sound on. We can't use the Vox feature (the Vox feature only turns on the monitor video/audio when it hears a sound) because we use a white noise machine, so there's always sound transmitting. It'd be nice to blank the display and leave audio on at night so our room wasn't illuminated, but I find the display goes dark enough so long as there's not an object immediately in front of it (closer than the baby).", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "useless for newborn", "Author": "busy academic \"busy academic\"", "ReviewID": "RKYZGHALFIBI8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The camera and display are too small and the resolution not high enough to actually see whether my newborn is crying or just making grunting sounds.

It has held up well in the past 2 years, so for longevity's sake, I would definitely recommend it.  However, I do have a few issues with it.  To be fair, this is the only monitor we have ever owned, so some of the comments may be flaws with all monitors. I am grateful it has lasted this long...1. First, when my daughter was born, we used the clip attachment to hold the camera on the rail of her crib.  However, it seemed we could never get it tight enough, and the camera would swivel around, blocking our view.  This is in part due to the clip attachment (much like a vice grip), as well as the huge power adapter which weighed too much to keep the camera in one location.2. The two options for picking up sound are the continous feed and the intermittent.  With the continous feed, I can hear a high pitched whine at all times when the monitor is on.  With the intermittent setting, the monitor screen is activated by sound.  When the monitor activates, it makes a loud popping noise.  Both are distracting; it depends on whether you want constant distraction or a rude awakening when this thing pops at night.3. There are a series of 3 songs that can be activated to play from the monitor handset. You can choose to play one song on a continuous loop, or all songs on a loop. The music is rather soothing, and the songs are common ones.  However, you have to also turn the music off from the monitor handset.  If you go into baby's room, and want to turn the music off, you have to turn the whole camera off to stop the music. Also, if you turn the music on while in the continuous monitoring mode, then decide to change to intermittent, the music stops.4. I am one of those people that leaves the AC adapter plugged ito the monitor handset at all times, so I have drained the battery to the point that it won't hold a charge for more than 5 minutes.  Too bad if I want to take the handset with me to another room; I have to unplug it and take the whole thing. Incidentally, when the battery is getting low, the little light on the front starts blinking, and the monitor hums/whines very loudly.  It is hard to miss.5. The picture quality is not that great, especially at night (looks rather grainy). Other reviewers have said that the screen freezes, but I have only noted it to \"flash\" very quickly and regularly.6. There is a night light on the camera, but it cannot be activated remotely.  It is a series of little orange stars.

This would happen every two or three weeks.  The monitor then began to make a loud clicking sound every time I would turn it on.  And alas, after turning the monitor off and on to unfreeze the screen today, the monitor made a loud POP and the entire screen went blank.  The video function no longer works--all I see now is a white screen.  Although the VOX seems to still work, it barely catches any sound in the nursery (which is why I never relied on the VOX function, just the video) so the entire monitor has become useless.

For the price, we have been very happy.  Here are some of the pros and cons from our experience.Pros:* The price.  For a video baby monitor, this asking price is pretty good.* Durability. We have carried the monitor around all over the house and put it through its paces.  So far, after 2.5 years, the monitor has held up and continues to work.  The camera itself has taken a few falls off the top of a dresser onto carpeted floor without any issues.* Range.  We have been able to receive a link signal to the camera from everywhere without our house (3200 sq ft).  This was pleasant surprise for me.  It includes having the camera in an upstairs bedroom and the monitor in a finished basement.  Still works great.* Vox.  The vox mode worked pretty well for us.  It was not too sensitive for needs most of the time.  Occasionally the fan would trigger the vox in the right conditions, but this is not a problem 90% of the time.* Volume. The monitor can be turned up very loud.  It's great for if you want to leave it in a room and do some other stuff in another room and still hear it.  We normally have it at just 1/4 volume, and it's great.Cons:* Video quality.  I'm not sure if this is due to the screen or the camera, but the colors are very washed out.  For the price, I didn't expect much as far as video quality goes.  It still gets the job done to get a quick peek at your child while you are out of the room.* Battery life.  The battery has degraded over the last couple of years and does not last very long now.  We have not yet looked into buying a replacement battery, so unfortunately, I can not comment on what that would cost.  This hasn't been a big deal for us as usually the monitor stays plugged in by our bed.* Night light feature bug.  There seems to be a bug with the system where every once in a while, the stars that light up on the camera will turn on without you pressing the button on the monitor.  They are not terribly bright, so it's not a big deal, but it could be an issue for some people.  Perhaps its interference from other wireless signals or something.  We haven't been able to pinpoint the problem.* Wireless interference.  We initially hit some bad interference with our wireless internet router in our house with this monitor.  After some channel switching, I was able to resolve the issue, but it was a pain for a while.  If you have a 2.4GHz wireless router, be aware that you may have some issue with wireless speed while the monitor is active.Overall, I would say that we are happy with this purchase.

But we had spent almost 200$ on it from Babies r us so decided to give it more time. My early complaints were that every time my son moved or a loud car drove through or neighborhood it would activate the VOX and as mentioned in other reviews it has an audible loud click when the video turns on. For a sleep deprived mom with a new born that \"click\" waking me up out of a dead sleep was unwelcomed. Also the music \"on\" switch is very easy to accidently hit and since there is no volume control to this music which i find too loud i was always scared to death of accidently hitting it so i nver carried the monitor around with me. The one time i did clip it to my waist to do dishes, i accidently hit the music button so i learned this quick.However, 10 months later, i love this monitor. The battery lasts easy 10 hours. sometimes i forget to plug it in before bed and it will go all night on battery. When my son started rolling over onto his stomach every time i put him down at 2 months old i was typical new mom terrified of him getting stuck on his belly and dying of SIDs (thanks \"back is best\" campaign.) having the video was piece of mind. Even though it isnt high- def i could actually see his back moving up and down as he breathed. I came to appreciate the \"click\" when he got older and i wanted to let him cry it out and learn to self soothe but it was REALLY hard to listen to him cry. So id turn the audio all the way down and just listen for a \"click\" when he was asleep or awake. Now that he likes to talk himself to sleep it is also nice. I saved the best for last- I COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT THAT STUPID MUSIC PLAYER! my son loves it!! even the monitor is one of his favorite toys because he can listen to music from it player through the speaker and watch the lights. When he is sick or just having difficulty settling down or i just need to buy a few extra minutes with him in his crib in the morning or post-nap all i have to do is \"twinkle twinkle him\" and he just lays there sucking his thumb and staring up at the light on the camera. so glad i did not replace this before giving it a chance. seeing it for so cheap on amazon it is a must have if you are concidering a video monitor.We had to mount it to the wall out if his reach. Wish it had a wall mount but we made do.Update: 4/8/12 after 13 months of use-Unit has stopped working in a functional way. Started a couple weeks ago with the VOX just staying on all the time. Then the sound would not cut on at the handheld device. Now you turn it on and it just freeze frames randomly. so it looks like my kid is sound asleep but i am hearing thumping noise from upstairs which can only be my son.

Firstly, you need to shut off the camera part of the unit when you are not using it, since it tends to overheat if left plugged in all the time.  So you will need to remember to switch it off in the morning after all night use.  Secondly, the stand for the camera is completely useless, it is almost impossible to steady the camera in the desired direction.  We just used a bit of tape to make the neck of the base more sturdy, and fixed the camera in place that way.

All they could offer me was to buy another monitor at $80.00. I informed then I didn't want to buy another monitor just to have it die a year later. I offered to pay for the repairs myself (in hopes I could save some money), but they stated they don't repair any products after the year warranty. It is disappointing that a product that at paid $164 only lasted a year. Apparently from the other reviews I have read on Amazon.com other purchasers have also had their monitor malfunction soon after the year warranty expired. I cannot recommended this produce due to it's short product life, sub par video quality and annoying buzzing when one raises the volume.

We noticed that the night vision illuminators would flicker and the picture freeze every few seconds.  As a result, we sent it in for warranry repair and the company made it very clear that it would take up to 6 weeks to have the monitor returned.  Well, our monitor returned almost 6 weeks later with the same problems.  For new parents... let me just tell you that a 6 week turnaround time is unacceptable when you have a newborn (something Levana oddly doesn't recognize).In less than a year, the next problem was that the power recepticle on the monitor broke into the unit so it would no longer be charged.  Rather than send it in again, wait another 6 weeks for the repaired unit, we bought a much more expensive monitor from motorola.  Motorola Digital Video Baby Monitor with 3.5 Inch Color LCD Screen.  This monitor is leaps and bounds better than the levana.  Also you can remotely control the monitor to move it where your baby is in the crib, and it monitors the temperature in the room.  Something the Levana could not do.  Also the Levana often lost signal to the camera one house floor below where the baby was sleeping.  The motorola in this review could effortlessly get a signal in the basement of the hous.My advice to you, is dont do what I did by buying this sheap one, sending it back once leaving us without a montor for weeks, then have to send it in again because the power blug broke.

We use it every night and for his naps. We live in an apt with wi-fi so interference free feature was a huge selling point especially with neighbors close by. I love the VOX (voice activated feature) so the screen doesn't have to be on the whole time especially during the night when you can occasionally catch some zzzzz's and not be disturbed by the bright light. The feed goes out if I place the monitor in the living room, which is the farthest from the baby's room but it usually kicks back on in a few seconds. There are minimal walls so not sure why it goes out. It holds it's charge really well. I keep it charged at night on my nightstand and take it with to the kitchen/living room when he naps during the day. The color image they show on the product description is not so accurate at least for me it isn't but not a big deal.

The picture quality isn't great but it worked for what we needed.  When the picture was on, the monitor made a loud buzzing noise that I couldn't sleep through so I came to love the VOX option - turns sound and screen off unless baby makes a sound loud enough to set it off - usually the sound of the screen coming on was enough to wake me up to check on the baby.  This feature ended up being the downfall of the monitor.The first problem I noticed with the monitor was the frequent \"Out Of Range\" message that came on the screen accompanied by a loud set of beeps.  This would happen increasingly frequently regardless of whether we were 10 feet down the hall from the kids, or  across the house on a separate floor.  We called customer service who instructed us to re-sync our monitor to camera and told us to give it some time.  The message continued.  I'm not sure exactly when this next problem started because, unfortunately, being on separate floors, without the monitor we cannot hear the kids.  When out of town one weekend I had the monitor sitting right in front of me (no \"out of range\" message) and I hear my daughter screaming bloody murder from upstairs.  The monitor showed nothing.  I rushed upstairs to find my daughter completely distraught.  This was the first of 3 times that I had this experience before purchasing a new monitor (when I found out I was expecting another child).  I would hear my child screaming and crying and check the monitor to find that not only did it show no signs that my child was making any noise (it has a noise level indicator) when I turned the screen on manually it would take a second and then I would hear by daughter loud and clear.  I began getting up frequently throughout the night just to check to see if she was alright and the monitor slowly became completely pointless.  I cannot imagine leaving my child's safety (especially that of a newborn) and my own mental ease in the hands of this company.Before purchasing a new monitor I did call Levana customer service who informed me that even thought the monitor had been in use less than 9 months, they would not replace the monitor.  They had no instructions for me on how I might fix it and simply encouraged me to buy another monitor by offering 20% off of my next purchase.After this experience I would not use another Levana monitor if they gave it to me for free.

Setup was fairly straight forward and was up and running within 5 minutes of plugging everything in.  The screen portion is lightweight and has decent battery life.  The camera portion has infrared L.E.D.s that tend to blink sporadically and image quality is fair at best.  The rounded camera is difficult to aim without using the screw attachment to steady it.  Using the pictured magnetic base is not very convenient because the AC adapter cord tends to pull on the camera and turn it towards wherever the cable is coming from. The automatic sound feature is inconvenient because it is factory preset at some level that may or may not work with the ambient noise level in your child's room. In our case it kicks in at several times depending on the level of sound made by the background/sleep music in our child's room.  In other words, we can here only the mid to high volume sounds in the room (which is fine for toddler because he really makes noise when he needs a bottle or a diaper change). I would not recommend it for newborns or infants, because you may not hear the lower volume fussing sounds that you would normally want to check out to see if they are too cold or uncomfortable. This unit is also prone to losing its connection between the camera and monitor once or twice a week and has a loud warning tone that will scare the crap out of you in the middle of the night.I returned the first unit that we purchased because of the disconnection problem and customer service was fairly responsive and sent a replacement unit that has a bigger noise insulator on the AC adapter cord that has reduced the problem to the aforementioned once or twice a week issue (inconvenient but bearable).Overall it's not a bad unit for the price.  We have tried several other brands already over the course of two years and those literally fell to pieces from wear and tear (and we are very careful with our gadgets). The other units had inferior picture quality, inferior battery capacity and poor build quality at a higher price point (because of the brand name).

We attempted Customer Service, but between the delay in getting it fixed through them (they would take 3 weeks to check it and identify the problem, and wouldn't replace it anyway because we'd had it over a year), it was less frustrating to buy a new one.Here are the cons:- poor image quality;- it's supposed to go on when the baby cries, but there is delay and the baby oftens cries a while before the monitor registers the sound;- conversely, monitor is so sensitive to background noise it goes off because of the fan or heater in the room;- the position of the transformer on the electrical cord makes mounting the monitor on the magnetic base difficult as it topples over if you set it at the \"wrong\" angle (how is that helpful when you should be able to customize the view?)- stopped charging altogetherOf course, this last issue was the final straw.  At about 7 or 8 months, we had noticed that every once in a while the monitor seemed to need to be charged at night(even though we kept it charging during the day).

We were using the traditional, sound only, has-to-plug-into-an-outlet-to-work baby monitor.  Every time we heard the slightest disturbance, we would rush into our daughter's room to find that she was fine.  A good friend of ours had mentioned that she uses a Babyview 20 monitor, and that it was \"the best baby product they had ever purchased.\"  Needless to say, we did some research.  We found the price is quite affordable and that most people seem to be very happy with this product.  So, we bought one.The Babyview 20 has been nothing short of a dream come true.  The night vision camera is perfect!  We can see our daughter's every move, day or night.  **If you have your bedroom light on, the monitor displays video in perfect color.**The sound quality isn't the best you'll ever hear, but it is certainly good enough.  Some people complain in their reviews about how the sound turns on and off frequently.  This doesn't bother us at all, in fact, it's awesome.  When we are sleeping, we hate the annoying \"hissing\" sound from our old baby monitor.  The Babyview 20 only plays sound when a loud-enough sound occurs near the camera.  We sleep much better, and have never been awakened because our daughter rolled over and made a slight noise.The battery life is excellent.  We usually plug it in to charge over night and it lasts all day - no matter how many naps she might take.The signal used to transmit audio and video from the camera to the monitor is digital.  This means no interference.  We have never experienced any interference.  The signal is perfectly private and secure.I also remember reading that some people experienced problems if they used wireless internet.  We have a CISCO wi-fi router with broadband internet.  We have a desktop PC, a laptop, a wireless printer, and a playstation 3 that are all connected to our home wireless network.  We often use several of these devices simultaneously with the Babyview 20 and have never experienced any issues - none whatsoever.I highly recommend this feature to anyone who wants piece of mind, without having to constantly be \"hovering\" over their child.

I was overall disappointed with this monitor.  The video screen on the monitor is very bright making it hard for me to sleep with it on.  It does have a VOX feature where the video & audio cut off to save batteries and cut back on when a set level of sound is heard from baby's room.  This did not work well in practice.  The monitor made a loud clicking sound when turning on/off...waking me up several times during the night, even when baby didn't need anything.  It appeared to do this even if baby only turned over or moved in bed.  It would be better if video & audio could be controlled separately-allowing you to turn on/off the video monitor at will & leave audio running all the time at whatever volume you chose.  My monitor broke after 6 months of use-made a loud clicking sound in the night & shut off.  It has not worked since.  I found customer service hours not user friendly for a parent with small children-they are not available on weekends or evenings.  It is nearly impossible to place a call & wait on hold during 9-5pm business hours with multiple little ones at home.  I tried once, reached voicemail, left a message & missed their call the following day.

The only \"bad\" thing about this particular package though; is that it did not come with a mounting bracket.

We actually had to return our first one because of a weird buzzing sound, got a replacement, then it stopped taking a charge after using it multiple times daily for about 18 months. So, my expectations we not that it should last forever, but it is definitely better than some of the other monitors we've tried. I did not buy another because we now need 2 cameras and this is not compatible. FYI - we bought and returned the 2-camera Levana version. It is nothing like this Babyview20.

Also, my husband reminded me of one BIG FLAW that I had managed to overlook.  When it is in VOX status if there is any sound or movement the picture does not come on!  You get a white screen and you have to turn the unit off and on to get a picture.  I spoke to customer service and they said the monitor and the camera had to be synched again.  I followed their instruction but it did not help.  This problem is enough for my husband to not want another monitor from Levana for our second child so it is worth mentioning.  The picture quality is excellent and I love the night vision capability.  I have to say when my daughter was really young the ability to press a button and play a lullaby was PRICELESS.  There were times when I would be busy and couldn't get to her right away and I played the lullaby and it worked like a charm.Improvements I would like to see are as follows:Add the ability to pan or zoomNight lights should not be on the cameraGreen indicator light on the camera is so bright I had to cover that with a piece of cardboardShould have the ability to add cameras", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Like it, but has a designn flaw", "Author": "Sarah L.", "ReviewID": "RCSQKRUKN6OIC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I use this every night and for naptimes.

I have accidentally started up the music a few times and woke up my baby unitentionally.

It didn't interfere with any wireless and had decent picture and sound.However after 5 months of use it broke. The pin to plug in the charger to the monitor broke off so we were unable to charge the unit. This happened at 8pm and of course no one was available to speak to us or tell us how to try to fix it. We had to wait for a phone call back from them 2 days later. We paid shipping to return it to them and it was returned to us 3 weeks later after constant calls from us as to why it was taking so long. The returned unit is much worse in my opinion. The \"refurbished\" unit now:-emits a constant buzz when the picture is on-interferes with the wireless-the picture and sound are choppy-does not have a convenient mounting unit for the camera (our old one had a clamp to mount to the crib--Levana said it was recalled and gave us just a little platform for the camera which cannot be mounted to the crib)We have since contacted the company who said we can ship it back to them (again with us paying for the shipping) for them to try to fix it again! We may just take a loss on this one.The only pros I can think of (going off of our original unit) were:-decent picture (the night vision is better than daylight)-dial controlled volumecons:-no option for constant sound---it will only turn on with a LOUD sound-lullaby is kind of useless, we never needed it-no option to manually turn the screen on and offWe purchased the summer infant slim and secure to use while this one was getting \"fixed\" and really like it. The picture quality is good, it has a constant sound option and you can turn the screen off while you sleep.

(Please note that you will only get a color screen when there is light in the room. When dark, the infrared camera will return a black and white picture.) The mounting hardware allows the camera to be attached to a crib for a close up view of your sleeping infant, or further away on a bookshelf for a wider view. (The closer the camera is to the baby, the more sensitive the microphone is). It's also very easy to move, which is useful for packing it up for a trip to the relatives.With a 2nd baby on the way, we are totally getting another one.

It has no battery level indicator, so you can't tell how much charge is left.The picture quality is decent, which is the only reason I have anything good to say about this camera, but seriously, WHO designed this thing?  There is a BRIGHT red light on the FRONT of the camera shining right in the baby's eyes... the buttons on the side of the monitor to turn on the music, is right next to the VOX button to turn off the screen.  So at 3am, when fumbling around trying to turn on or off the screen, you could very easily hit the music button- waking up the baby even more.  Dumb placement of these buttons.  Plus, there is NO WAY to turn off the monitor screen and leave the sound up unless you use the VOX, but if you have a humidifier or fan, then it automatically turns it back on all the time!  So forget about using this camera if you use any type of other white noise in the room or a humidifier.  There is no pan or zoom like the Summer Infant, so the camera must be in one place.  This is fine for newborns, but when they get older, it's nice to be able to pan around the room, or zoom in.  So I am returning this camera after only 2 days, because it is just the worst design and camera I've seen.

I find that it is a real-time image (I can watch her breathe) and while I used to wish that I could hear every little noise, now I am happy that it just clicks on for the more substantial noises.The songs are a very annoying addition to this monitor.  I never found that it soothed her, and there have been very untimely accidents where my finger has slipped and turned it on.  The nightlight has held no use for us, but it makes for a cute circle of stars :)I love that unlike much of what I have read online about other monitors, this does not seem to pick up images outside of our house because of the digital feed.  Makes me feel secure that our images aren't being broadcast either.All that said, this is definitely not interference-free.  It hasn't made us look for another monitor though - it is just a nuisance.  The microwave and wireless internet are the culprits.  If I have the monitor in the kitchen and cooking dinner - loud beep and \"out of range.\"  If we download songs online - same story.

We've only owned this unit for 7 months and it's definitely on the higher end, around $175 when we purchased.

Super easy to set up and worked right away.  We have taken it on vacation and to relative's houses and it is very portable.  The attachment piece for the camera is a little awkward but we've managed to always find a place to fit it on to. My main complaints for the camera piece are the length of the power cord and the infared lights.  The cord is short so unless you want to use the battery-powered wireless option you need to have an outlet close to where the camera will be.  I've noticed that if the camera is more than 6 feet or so away from the baby the image is not the greatest.  The infared lights are bright and my daughter definitely was concerned with them the first few times we used this monitor.  She got used to them after a bit but some fussier sleepers may be bothered by them.The receiver is good- I haven't had any problem with accidentally turning on the music as some others have said.

The con's: LCD viewing angle is poor, wireless range isn't great, sound level is too low and doesn't catch lower level sounds.The product comes pre-configured so its easy to setup and start using right away.  It has several nice features like night vision and lullaby music.  The sound level is too low, so if you are a deep sleeper it won't wake you.  Also, the sound isn't always on, its shuts off until a noise is heard.  This feature? makes it difficult to hear faint sounds or rustling. The wireless range wasn't great and would say out of range in a couple spots in my house. If I gripped the LCD unit near the antenna, range was drastically reduced.  The LCD is difficult to see unless you view directly straight on. The LCD viewing angle is maybe +/- 25 degrees on both up/down and sideways.In short, I am thinking of purchasing another brand cause of the problems above.", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Worth every dollar!!!!

Zheng \"ivorylily\"", "ReviewID": "R3A015Q1QDD4MP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Now we've had this gadget for nearly 6 months, I can write a pretty informative review on this product.First of all, if you can't decide between the Summer Infant over this one, there is only one major determination factor to influence your decision: Do you live in a neighborhood with lots of babies around you? If the answer is yes, then you are better off going with this one. If not, Summer Infant might be adequate. The reason being digital vs analog. This device is digital so nobody will pick up your signal. Summer Infant is analog, so if your neighbor has one, they might pick up your imagesOk, now to the pros and cons of this product.Pros:1.Picture quality is awesome. Even at night, I can clearly see what my baby is doing. During the day, the color is very vivid. Don't expect to see color at night. There is no color without lights2. Vox feature is great. We usually leave Vox on all night. So the screen is dark. If she cries and the sound exceeds certain level, the picture pops up and you will know she is awake. Another nice thing is that if you have the soothing toy nearby that makes sound, like the music played by her mobile and the sleep sheep's sound, it won't trigger it. I absolutely love this feature3. Battery life is somewhat decent. I had it on Vox without plugging in all night, the handheld device is still going in the morning4. I love the camera setting. It's a magnetic base so you simple put the ball shaped monitor on top of it and rotate around to adjust the angel. It also has an adapter to hook it up on any crib. No screw required5. you can remotely turn on the music played by the monitor by using the handheld. It's nice to have when you need a few extra minutes before you can get to the baby and let the music sooth her. We don't use it often though.6. Single best feature: nobody can pick up your images!Cons:1. Static noise can drive you crazy if you keep the picture on all time. Because it's so loud, the static usually is the sound to wake me up, not the baby's cry next door, so I can't say it's all bad2. The sound of it is OK. It's not too crystal clear. Sometimes I can't tell if the baby is crying or just cooing to herself3.This is the biggest drawback as a digital device: when this thing is on, it shuts down our Netbook's wireless receiver. I don't know why, but my netbook's internet connection will be killed instantly. However, it does not bother our full size laptop nor the Mac mini, just the stupid netbook.Over all, it's a great little device.

The range on the monitor is also good -- I've been able to walk to the mailbox and back (around the corner from my house) without losing the signal.  We have not had any issues with picture quality or buzzing like other reviewers mentioned, so I'm happy about that.So far my only complaint is that from time to time, the monitor (for no apparent reason) switches to \"Out of Range\" for a second, then goes back to the image, and it goes back and forth doing this for quite some time.

I was coming back to update my review, but realized the review I'd written was actually for the monitor I'd purchased to replace this one.At first, this video baby monitor was awesome.  My wife and I would bring the monitor upstairs so that we could watch television for a little while before we went to bed, and we always ended up just watching our son over the monitor instead.  The night vision was not bad for low-light, and when our son took daytime naps, the color picture was very good.  The sound was good quality, and we liked that we could turn a few lullabyes on and off from upstairs.  The range was also very good.But.When we went to visit some family about two and a half months after buying the monitor, we set it up and I realized about half an hour later that the picture looked as if it hadn't changed at all.  I went to go check on my son (the room we were stayign in was on the other side of the house), and he was crying miserably.  You'd never know by the picture frozen on the screen!We tried repeatedly to use the monitor after that day, but it never worked well again.  After reading several other reviews here, it seems as if the same thing happened to several other consumers.  For well over $100, this unit should be working as well as it did at first for several years, not 75 days.  We were (and remain) very disappointed with the product.I give the BABYVIEW20 two stars, but only because it has such great potential; it worked great at first.

The screen could stand to dim more for night time use in our bedroom, it's at least as bright as a night light & usually right next to your face, so that could be a problem for some people.  The VOX option doesn't turn on at quiet enough noises, so we don't bother with it.  The battery life after 8 months of use is still +4 hours.  The volume will come on throughout the time it's running, making strange shifts from no sound to a white noise sound.  About half of the time, this is due to an actual noise.  It's durable, I drop it weekly & though the antenna cover broke once, I was able to fit it back on without it continuing to fall off all the time.

I researched video monitors for weeks looking for one that was safe and reliable with great picture quality and no feedback, and I hit the jackpot with the Levana BabyView20. I researched it on the web and found that I could watch a demo of the video quality here: [..]. When the monitor arrived, it was very easy to mount to the side of my son's pack n' play, and the video quality is clear enough that I can see my son's chest rise and fall as he's sleeping. As the mother of a child with unique medical needs, this was an extremely important feature. With the night vision, I can feel confident that he is breathing well without having to go into his room and possibly interrupt his sleep. I also love that I can turn music on remotely to calm him when he gets fussy, and the battery on the handheld monitor lasts for longer than his nap, which is anywhere from two to three hours. I also love that the audio only turns on when he makes noise or moves significantly, which is fantastic and really eliminates feedback. The buzzing is so minimal that I can sleep with it only a foot away and not hear it at all. Before getting this monitor, I went in my son's room anytime he made a noise because I wanted to be sure he was okay. This was completely detrimental to training him to sleep through the night, and we spent two years getting up a dozen times a night to check on him. Now we know exactly how he's doing in his room, and he's been sleeping through the night for nearly as long as we've had the monitor.

The 900MHz monitor picked up so much interference I felt like the kid in the Shyamalan movie, Signs, who picked up alien signals. The only thing worse that a crying baby waking me up in the middle of the night is the baby's monitor going off with bleeps and chirps, ugh!Things that set this monitor apart:-Ability to \"Send\" a song to the camera in the baby's room like Rockaby Baby-Night and Day camera capability. It automatically changes to InfraRed (or whatever it uses) when it's dark.-Portable, battery powered camera AND monitor (i.e. can be completely wireless) NOTE: Camera uses 4AAA and monitor is NiMh rechargeable-Comes with two stands for the camera (a fixed, crib mount and a temporary magnetic one for flat surfaces)-The belt clip for the monitor rotates around 180 degrees to be the monitor's stand: I love that simple and smart design feature.-Adequate range. We live in a two-story townhouse and we get a signal in the basement from the baby's room on the 2nd floor.Things I would change about product:-Improve the quality of the crib mount, not all cribs have right angles and the clamp is okay, but not ideal of every surface.-Lengthen the power cord for the monitor/camera, right now it's only about 4' long.

Image quality is great, the vox function works very well, it activates just after the baby starts making sounds but you can turn the volume down and just observe the green bar that \"shows\" you the sound volume if you want. For me the most important thing is to be able to see what the baby is doing just after I put her to sleep. In a dark room I can't see if she has her eyes closed or not but with the camera I can see it perfectly without disturbing her. For me it's a good indication to see if she is ready to seep or if she needs more settling.It's not perfect for two reasons. Both pretty common. The first one is the red light in the front that lights up whenever you turn the device on. I saw that most of the monitors have this kind of light and I can't understand why they can't put it at the back. The light is pretty strong in the dark and I was afraid it would disturb the baby so I opened the device and removed the light \"gently\".

My friend has the Summer Infant Day & Night Handheld Color Video Monitor, but while I was shopping, I saw that this one has more features and doesn't cost that much more. We have used this for 3 months since my son moved out of the bassinet in our room to the crib in his nursery.This monitor was so easy to set up, I just took it out of the box and plugged it in. The screen is big and decent. Don't expect HD TV quality, it's more like a webcam picture. The night vision is great, but the daytime picture is gray looking, but still a clear image. The volume is more than loud enough and crystal clear and without interference. I like that the camera and parent unit have power adapters and the option to use batteries in both. Now on to my favorites of this nifty item! The voice-activated feature is awesome!!! At first I wasn't sure I'd like it because I wanted to keep the sound on and just turn on/off the video at will like my friend's video monitor, but now I'm glad the whole parent unit shuts off unless the baby makes a noise. I have never had problem with it not working and I actually find the vox feature quite sensitive to noise. I like the music feature, but don't like the fact that the sound and video on the parent unit stays on if you turn the music in the camera on.  The crib mount has been great because I get a close view of my baby, BUT now that my son rolls around, he partially moves in and out of view of the camera since the camera only covers about 80% of his crib (I placed it on the side of the crib at the very end, so only the 20% area closest to the camera is out of view). I know once he starts to pull himself up I will have to move the camera altogether or else he will be able to mess with it. It comes with a magnetic base that allows the camera to be manually turned and tilted for a better view, but no wall mount which would give the optimal view so I will have to put it on his dresser next to the crib. The camera doesn't pan or zoom. You also can't control the nightlight feature from the parent unit.None of the negative aspects of this baby monitor warrant losing a star in my opinion because you will not find a video monitor that has it all in this price range.

What I find most handy is the standby mode for nighttime and the nightlight feature on the camera.I keep the monitor plugged in during the night, but in standby mode and the volume off.  My 4 month old daughter sleeps 10 hours through the night, but does wake occasionally.  In those cases, I find she will murmur and cry for a few minutes then puts herself back to sleep.  I'm a light sleeper, so I sound of the monitor switching out of standby mode is enough to wake me up.  There is a low buzz when the monitor is on that probably only I could hear.  As long as she's making noises, there's the buzz.  When it's quiet, it automatically goes back into standby.  I found this enough for me to know when she's awake without needing to hear the cries.At night, I turn on the nightlight and I think it's enough for her.  There are some red lights (I think for the nighttime image).  When we first installed the camera, she would stare mesmerized by the red light.  Now she's gotten used to it.  I don't use the remote lullaby feature too often.  My only complaint is that sometimes it will lose signal even when I'm a short distance away (less than 50 feet away).

Comparing the 2 monitors & including some general Pros/cons:+ Levana has a dramatically better picture, there is little to no static, the monitor doesn't get hot AT ALL when the video is on (unlike our other video monitor), excellent battery life, lightweight & easy to tote around. - Some \"trouble\" areas that we have found:  (1) the camera does in fact go out of range when we go outside, despite pictures/statements to the contrary. Does OK in the garage.  (2) The heavy plug-in cord that attaches to the device to dock/charge sometimes does not get fully connected, specifically if the heavy part of the cord is hanging off an end table, for example.  We realized this after we heard a high-pitched squeal that the unit emits before it runs out of battery (usually around 4am, ugh!)  (3) There are 2 video modes...on all the time or off until there is sound/movement at which time it flashes on.

Doi", "ReviewID": "R2Y2C18BAD2UVX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We've been using this for about 3 months so far and it does help.  The concept of having a camera in the baby's room to keep an \"eye\" on them without having to go in, and possibly disturbing them, is great.Packaging:It arrived in the standard brown amazon box with air filled padding.  The actual product was in a compact box with the components nicely packed. It was relatively easy to remove with some tape and twist ties holding everything in place.  Contents:  1 x Camera  1 x AC Adapter for camers  1 x \"Magnetic\" mounting base for camera  1 x Clamp style mount for camera  1 x Receiver, color monitor  1 x AC Adapter for monitor  1 x ManualInitial Setup:Setting it up to do a test run was very easy.  Plug the AC adapters into the appropriate hardware and turn them on.  The manual says to sync them but they were working fine out of the box.  If you are going to run the camera on double A batteries, you will need a small Philips head screwdriver to get the back plate off.  I'm not sure the running time on batteries as I just leave it plugged in.  The rechargeable battery for the monitor wasn't charged so you will need to charge it if you plan to use it off AC power.  It charged in about 2 hours.Features:The camera has an on/off switch which is easy to operate. When on, there is a red light that turns on above the camera lens.  It's not too bright but it is noticeable.  Our baby tended to stare at it the first couple of nights.  It also has 3 stars along the top of it that will glow an orange color with the \"night light\" option turned on.  The switch for the night light is a button that is easy to turn on and off.The monitor has 5 buttons, volume scroller, status lights and the screen.  The buttons on the left hand side control the lullabies and the VOX option.  The right hand buttons control the brightness of the screen and the volume scroller controls the volume.  The lullabies are turned on/off by the upper left hand side button and the lullaby selection is handled by the button right below it.  The VOX options will only turn the monitor screen on when it registers a sound from the camera (ie. baby crying).  I guess this is used to save battery life, but in practice, doesn't work well at all (see cons for more info).  The brightness control lets you change the brightness of the display, which helps at night when you don't want the monitors display shining in your face.  It can get decently dim and very bright, however, the night vision pulses detract from the usefulness of the dimmer.  The status lights show you if the power is on, if you have a connection with the camera, if the lullabies are on, and if you are in VOX mode.  The power light will turn blue if it's charging, red if it's on battery, and flash red when it's low on battery life.  There is also a volume indicator which shows the volume of the sound being picked up by the camera.Day time use:Day time use is great.  The picture quality in color is nice, you can see baby without any issues.  I didn't get a chance to see how viewable the screen was outside in the direct sunlight, but inside it works great.Night time use:The camera automatically switches to \"night vision\" mode when the light gets too low for day color use.  The color screen display becomes more of a black & white w/ greenish tint.  It's easy enough to see baby at night.  As other reviewers have noted, the display pulses about every 6 seconds, which is annoying when you're trying to sleep yourself.Pros:+ Easy Setup+ Color monitor w/ night vision+ Rechargeable monitor battery+ Portable monitor+ Multiple mounting options for camera+ No interference from other sourcesCons:- Night vision mode monitor pulses every 6 seconds.- No volume adjustment for lullabies (it's very soft).- Receiver doesn't always pick up sounds.  I'm assuming it has a built in sound filter that is supposed to help eliminate background noise.  It works, but sometimes it doesn't pick up baby crying.  Also, if you're playing lullabies, it will occasionally pick up parts of the lullaby's sound.  It would be nice to be able to turn this feature off so that it picks up everything instead of random noises here and there.- VOX mode doesn't work well.  Probably because of the above.  It would randomly turn on at times from other sounds and sometimes wouldn't turn on when baby was crying.- AC adapter for the camera has a huge black cylinder located right before the plug into the camera.  When using the magnetic mounting base, this black thing tends to cause the camera to angle downward.  I think it's a filter to eliminate noise from the electrical signal, but it's so bulky it makes it hard to get a good angle on the camera.- Can interfere with other 2.4GHz wireless signals.  Occasionally my wireless internet gets knocked off because of this.Untested:= Range of unit.  I live in a small apartment so the max distance I could test was about 100ft through 2 drywalls. It was fine at this range.= Viewable in direct sunlight.= Durability over long usage period.Conclusion:Overall, it's a decent product.  Daytime use is great, but night time use is hampered by the constant pulsing of the monitor.  The sound pick up also needs to be improved.  In a small apartment, it's ok as I can still hear the baby from the room, but in a larger house, it might not be so good.  It did give us peace of mind that we could see the baby whenever we needed to without having to go into baby's room.  This was a great tool, especially when transitioning baby from the basinet to the crib.  We can check baby's sleep position, that baby is still breathing, and if baby is calming down.  If you can live with the 2 major flaws (pulsing and sound pick up), this is a good product.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great product!", "Author": "Stephanie Paulk", "ReviewID": "R23MQF3767AURD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband and I have really enjoyed using this product.

However, when my baby arrived a month later, I realized that there were other problems with this unit that I did not expect...First of all, the battery on the monitor died within a week, and did not hold a charge for very long subsequently.  Now I pretty much have to keep it plugged in all through the night since I will end up having to do it at some point anyway.Second, the sound cuts in and out.  At one point I saw my baby moving around and making faces, but heard no sound from the monitor.  When I went into his room to investigate, he was well awake and making whining noises.  If I had not been awake to see my son's movement, I would not have known that he was awake.Finally, and the biggest problem of all, on this side of the hand-held monitor are buttons that activate lullabies on the camera end in the baby's room.  From time to time while handling the monitor, your hand will hit a button that turns on the lullaby which wakes the baby up.  This became very frustrating after a while.  Now I have to be very cautious of how I hold the monitor so I don't press the buttons that turns on the lullaby.Overall, the product does its job and there are some very good qualities, such as the zero-interference and night vision optoins; however, the other annoying attributes of this product persuade me to not give it a recommendation.", "Date": "October 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Absolutely worth every penny!", "Author": "Alexander Heyman \"aheymanduke\"", "ReviewID": "R19QYCZKP2FMUD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have not written reviews for Amazon.com before now, but I felt compelled to write about this video monitor.  Quick background, we have a 14 year old daughter and an infant.  I thought my wife would be an Old Pro at this, not a New Mommy, but turns out 14 years is a long time to remember everything.  SO... the very nice audio-only monitor that we bought before the baby was born was great in theory, but in practice my wife went into the baby's room to check on her every 20 minutes or so during a nap and as often as every hour overnight.  Hence, she didn't sleep well, the baby didn't sleep well- NOT the ideal situation.Enter this video monitor.  I bought it on a Friday, paid the extra $7 for the Saturday delivery, and all of my wife's concerns were solved immediately.  The camera attaches to a bracket to mount on the crib, it plugs into the wall, and in less than 3 minutes we had it up and running with live video feed across the house.  The picture quality gets an A- in daylight and an A for its (very cool) night vision.  My wife can carry the monitor around the entire house, watch the baby any time she's sleeping, and it completely eases her mind to see the baby is safe.Only two things that aren't great:  1. The voice-activated function sometime doesn't pick up softer noises, so it can take a good squawk to turn the video on from the sleep mode.  #2.  It claims to be interference free, but we have found that using a computer or other Wi-Fi device within about 10 feet of the monitor tends to block the internet or slow it WAY down.  Easy fix, just move the monitor or turn it off for a few minutesOverall, it is a very economical solution to help calm a nervous new mother's nerves when the baby is sleeping in the other room, starting to roll over, etc.  This is not James Bond quality spy equipment, but it gets the job done very nicely and for a great price.

I found the problem can be fixed by turning off the camera and turning it back on.A quick phone call next day to their 24x7 hotline provides excellent information on how to fix this \"problem\".

However, it lacks the audio sensitivity for covering an entire room.The long:  My wife and I sought a video monitor for watching our child who is now three years old.  As mentioned in my review of a different monitor (audio only), I value my privacy immensely.  Baby monitors, both audio and video models, are difficult to find in a digital broadcast format.  Most of them are analog.  This means that anyone with a baby monitor or scanner can pick up those frequencies and listen or WATCH.  Thanks, but I don't need my neighbors listening to my family conversations, let alone watching.  This monitor does not have that problem as it is digital.When the manufacturer says interference free, they mean it.  The video quality on this is superb.  No, it's not a ultra high quality camera.  However, it provides a very good color and black/white (night only) picture with no snow or noise.My main disappointment with this is that I assumed I could set the camera on a dresser and aim it down towards the bed.  This works great for the video, but not the audio.  The audio does not broadcast continuously (much to my wife's dismay).  It has a set 'sound level' which will turn on the audio transmitter and send it to the receiver.  Unfortunately, if the camera is more than 7-8 feet away, it won't hit that level unless the noise is very loud.That said, I moved the camera and clipped it to the headboard, about 3-4 feet from my child's head... about what it would be on a crib.  It worked great after that.  I suppose I should have known it is mainly for a crib considering the built in night light and lullaby sounds (that can be activated from the receiver).Nonetheless, it is still a very high quality product if used for crib monitoring purposes.  We will still use it for video only monitoring since the picture is so good.PROS:* Well built with high quality materials.  It doesn't feel cheap.* Built in infrared lights allow day or night video* Magnetic swivel base or swivel clamp mounting* Clean, clear video picture* Innovative belt clip swivels into a prop stand* Remotely activated lullabysCONS:* Audio threshold should be more sensitive to allow placement on dresser or nearby furniture.* Nightlight doesn't really put out light... only 'glowing stars'RECOMMENDATION:I would highly recommend this if your intent is to monitor your child in a crib.

I am in the garage working on cars allot so I can have the monitor on my side at all times with the belt clip.You can use the VOX mode so that the camera only turns on when sound is heard or enough crying for that matter.The battery in the portable monitor is rechargeable and seems to last for many hours when I am using it unplugged.The music feature is also nice not too loud but would be nice to be able to adjust it.I really thought the pivot base for the camera is very well designed so that you can turn it up down and all around in any position.Negatives:Not really to  much not to like about it.The screen is low resolution but lets get real were not making HD films with it although it could be a little clearer.The screen frame rate it low so the movements are jerky but again were not making HD films with it.Night light is cute but that is about all it is.The manufacture states that it will work up to 150ft.

Setup is easy - just pop in the supplied rechargeable battery into the handheld unit and plug it in to charge.  The handheld can be used while charging, or you can wait till it's fully charged.  I have mine on my desk and will probably use it while plugged into the adapter since I'm always here working anyway, but since it's plugged in, the battery will always be charged and ready to go.  There's a belt clip on the back that doubles as a kickstand to keep the unit standing upright on a desk or table.Next, pop 4AAA batteries into the camera (not incl.) or use it wired via a second power adapter.  As far as setup, that's really pretty much all you need to do.  Just turn on the camera and the handheld unit, and you're good to go.  The camera can also be mounted using the included hardware mount.The lullaby feature, nightlight and such, are all pretty self explanatory and easy to use.  The coolest feature being the lullaby - you can select different songs to play from the handheld unit, change songs and even hear them play on the handheld unit itself.  The lullabys don't play very loud on the camera itself, but I wouldn't expect them to.  The nightlight on the camera has nice little stars that glow a gentle yellow, though I wish it could be turned on and off via the handheld unit, same as the lullabys.  The VOX feature turns the handheld screen on if the camera senses tje baby crying or making loud noise, though I don't honestly see using that feature since I'd rather have the handheld screen on all the time, as opposed to just part of the time.  Kind of negates the whole point of this thing, so not a useful feature in my opinion.  The camera also switches automatically between daylight and night vision modes and the quality of the night vision is pretty good.  The handheld unit also has brightness controls to improve the picture if need be.I only have 3 complaints:1)  The power adapters suck.  It was smart to make both the same so there's no confusion, but they both have those big klunky shielding nubs on the end that plugs into the camera and handheld unit.  This might not sound like a big deal, but I promise you won't like it if you want to use the adapter as the power source for the camera or handheld unit.  That big nub makes it impossible to do a nice, clean and unobtrusive wiring job because you've got this 1\" x 1.5\" cylindrical nub just a few inches from where it plugs into the camera or handheld unit.  I was going to use the adapter on the camera, but that dumb nub looks ugly and there's no way to do a nice wiring job because of it.  All it takes is one seemingly insignificant little thing like that to ruin an otherwise nice product. Probably looked good on paper or was cost effective, but in a working environment, just a very bad idea and totally unnecessary.2)  I have a pet peeve with LED lights on electronics that are too bright for units meant to be used in the dark.  The camera has a large green indicator light that glows green when the batteries are good and/or the power adapter is plugged in and the unit is on.  The LED glows red when the batteries need to be changed.  In daylight, the LED is fine, but at 3AM it feels like a bright spotlight.  There should be a way to turn it off or dim it automatically when the night vision is activated.  It doesn't need to be so big either.  Or they could've positioned it on the back of the unit and made it smaller.  It's not like baby needs to know the status of the batteries.3) Lastly, I really wish they would've had a video out hookup on the handheld unit.  I'd like to have the option of hooking this up to a larger monitor so I can see better.  That, or since it's WiFi, it could've linked into the computer somehow.  Not totally necessary, but it would've been an impressive addition.Overall, I'd say this is a pretty good unit, though I think the price is a little steep.Good Luck! :)", "Date": "October 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Extremely useful device", "Author": "Raven A. Wind", "ReviewID": "RBQH410CKFC2V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The BABYVIEW20 is a pretty straightforward device. You have a little camera/microphone that can either be mounted on a crib (or wherever) by a bracket, or sit on a magnetic plate and swivel around, and you have a receiver about the size of a 90s mobile phone that can tune in both sound and picture from the camera unit. Both work with either batteries or AC power adapter (included). The battery pack on the receiver is rechargeable, while the camera uses AA batteries and burns through those pretty quickly. You're better off using the AC adapter for the camera.The camera has night vision, which works pretty well. It also has a microphone, and can be set to turn on the receiver's screen if the sound in the room gets above a certain level (like, for instance, a baby crying). The camera also has the ability to play soothing music, which can be triggered from the receiver. If baby cries, the screen turns on, you hear the baby, and you can hit \"play\" and hopefully it puts baby back to sleep. Of course, your mileage may vary. The camera also has some star-shaped night-lights on it that can be turned on as an option.As a wireless camera, you can't ask for much more. My only regret is that I see no way to use it as as source for recording what you see on the screen. If you were thinking of using this as a security device once your baby outgrew the need, you'd find it rather limited.The receiver is intuitive, has a few basic controls and indicator lights, and has a nice stand on the back that can swivel around to become a belt clip.Video quality is that of a decent webcam. It's not anything you'd want to shoot video with, but then that's not the point. It lets you see what is happening a few rooms away, in the dark. Even if your baby sleeps through the night, this is sure to put worried parents at ease. You can check in without risking waking your baby by turning on lights or making noise in the room.Battery life, as stated, isn't so hot. If you turn the music or lights, the camera will burn through the four AA batteries in a couple hours. It's best to use the AC adapter, or just never use the music or night light feature if you intend to mount it somewhere away from an outlet and must rely on batteries. The receiver fares better. Using its own rechargeable battery pack helps, and the recharge time is only a few hours.The bottom line: This is a great baby monitor, but I wouldn't call it a home security device (despite some of the tags attached to it here on Amazon). It COULD be used for home security, but it would require you to monitor it in order to get any benefit, and if you're sleeping it's not going to be of much use in catching anyone. As a wireless surveillance device, however, it succeeds. I could see this being used in the kids' playroom or pointed at the back yard, so parents can keep an eye on the kids without being clinging to them all the time.

It is by far the best thing I have bought and makes my life with my first baby so easy!! The picture is great, no interferance from truckers, cell phones, etc. Very portable, cute design and I love that you can turn the music on from another room if the baby gets fussy! My only complaints are ones that I can live with. I wish the volume on the music was adjustable and I wish the battery on the monitor would give you a beep or two to let you know when it is about to die on you. That's it! Nothing major. This makes it easy to go take a shower, hang out on the other side of the house and even go out in the yard. You can always see what your baby is up to!

My son moves around constantly in his sleep.  It was difficult for me to keep him in the camera's view during most of his nap. This left the device useless to me.We ended up rigging the camera to my oldest son's RC car and allowing him to use the device as a spy system.  He loves it!For younger babies this would be an awesome product. There is a nightlight for the baby to look at and night vision to make monitoring baby easier for mom and dad.  The camera can be mounted or set in the holder.  The receiver is indeed interference free.  I would love to have had this when my kids were smaller.  However, I have made good use of it.A positive aspect of this product is that it can be used for different purposes after the baby gets too old for it. I've read other reviews that listed different uses.  I was able to make my son a mobile spy unit with it.  Overall I believe that it is money well spent. I just didn't discover it in time for it to be used as advertised.

Smith \"Impatient Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R247A2ENMB0UW4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Babyview is a reasonably good video monitor which gets the job done, but has some minor issues which detract from a five star rating.The GOOD:-Decent wireless range.  Expect about 90% coverage of a 2000sq ft. modern home.  Older homes might see 80%.-Decent video/picture quality which is easy to see and discern day or night.-The audio threshold which triggers the monitor to spontaneously turn on is perfectly tuned.  It comes on when baby is awake or thrashing and rarely activates for non-events.-The camera has a standard camera tripod mount, so that a clamp can be utilized to mount it securely onto a shelf or ledge.-Good battery, which holds a charge for many hours of mobile use.The BAD:-The 1.5\" plastic tip covering the antenna on the display unit is easily pulled off the unit.  Our toddler used to routinely pull it off.  It's perfectly sized to be swallowed and to choke a toddler to death.  It bothers me.  We ended up taping it securely to the unit with ugly electrical tape.-Unfamiliar family members (and occasionally even myself) accidentally press the music button on the monitor unit which starts blasting bad music to sleeping baby.  I've considered removing that button entirely.  The music has never served any useful purpose (it does not lull baby to sleep) and should probably be removed from the product.-Wireless connection is sometimes interrupted by computer or smartphone wifi data activity, which triggers an annoying, loud \"lost connection\" beep.  During 30 minutes of heavy internet usage, this might happen ten times.WOULD I BUY THIS AGAIN?  Probably not.  I wouldn't return or replace this unit, but if I were starting over--I would investigate other options due to the minor issues listed above.  Also, the addition of an ambient temperature sensor (found on some competing products) is a worthwhile feature missing from this one.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Levana Babyview20", "Author": "Barbara P Jones", "ReviewID": "R1UXCHUJYVLQU2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the Levana Babyview20 as a gift for a baby shower.

It has a number of innovative and useful features which make this monitor well worth price.*** Initial Impressions:***The Unit is well made and seems to be made to withstand minor drops or bumps.  The handheld unit is reasonably sized and the screen is the right balance of being large enough to see clearly yet small enough to make the receiver portable.  There is a clip on the back of the reciever which can be used to mount the handheld unit to your belt or swivel it around to use as a desktop stand. The clip is the only part of the unit that seems a bit fragile.Another big plus is that both the receiver and the camera can be used with batteries.  The camera can use 4 AAA batteries (not included) and the receiver uses a replaceable lithium battery which means that this device is truely portable and if the battery ever wears down you simply replace it with a new one or use the ac adapter.*** Setup: ***Setup is very easy.  Simply plug in the adapters and turn on the monitor and instantly you have a picture and audio of whatever the camera is pointing at.  The receiver unit has buttons on the side to control the contrast of the LCD screen as well as a volume/on off slider.  The other side has buttons which turn the music on and off on the camera, as well as change songs.  The front has small lights that tell you when each of the functions is on and it has multiple LED lights to show you the sound levels in case you keep the volume turned down.  The camera comes with a crib mount and also a stand to place it on a flat surface like a desk or dresser.*** Picture Quality: ***The small screen makes for a small picture and it is about medium resolution but it is definitely good quality. I found no interference at all from other appliances or from Wifi or cell phones. Unfortunately the video is less than 30 frames a second (probably more like 20-25) which means that motion is not fluid.  This is not really a big deal since this is a monitor and not a video camera!  The range is very good and works all over my house even on mulitple floors.  One thing that sets this monitor apart from the rest is that it has a an automatic night vision feature.  The camera automatically senses when it is dark and it switches on 9 infrared LEDs so that it can see in total darkness.  This means you can see your baby perfectly when the lights are out.*** Other Uses: ***Though this is marketed as a baby monitor it can be used for a number of other things.  You can place the camera near a front window and be able to see who is at the front door without having to get up (or come downstairs).  You can also use this as a makeshift security monitor.  I have also found this helpful for being able to see in tight and cramped situations like under a kitchen sink (to check for leaks) or to peek into a cramped attic. My wife even suggested that this would make a handy improvised backup camera for a large SUV.  The possibilities are endless!*** Positive Points Include: ***- Compact size- Good quality video- Video is a secure connection so others will not be able to view your home.- Easy Setup and has multiple uses- Works with AC adpaters or batteries so it truely portable- User replaceable batteries so you don't need to discard it once the batteries lose charge- Lots of features like night lights and sounds*** Negative Points Include: ***- Video framerate is less than 30fps so video is a bit jerky but its very good for its intended purpose.- Swivel clip on the back of the receiver seems a bit delicate- The camera portion is a bit large and could be smaller.- No video output so no chance of recording video (then again thats not what this is made for!)Overall the Levana Babyview20 is very good and well worth its price when you consider the multiple uses that can be found for it. I took off half a star because of the low frame rate and the rather large size of the camera.
