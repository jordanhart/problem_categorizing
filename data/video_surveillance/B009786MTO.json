I have T-mobile, I showed them the manual, they agreed the network was compatible. I purchased a whole new line, SIM card, 16 Gb memory card. I followed the instructions (which are not very clear) and it won't work. It doesn't respond, it doesn't take pictures or record, nothing. The only thing that works about it is the \"On & off\" switch (which in the manual, I think it's wrong) and when I sync it to my computer, I see the files but I don't see any recordings I texted the device to do.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009786MTO"}}
