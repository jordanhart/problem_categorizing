I installed it in April, 2013, and it has been working (almost) flawlessly ever since. For what I use it for, it has been great. I had to change my settings when the snow started falling last week. The camera, as I had things set, couldn't handle the bright light reflecting off the snow. I have the camera looking south directed towards the ground (of course). The sun's angle is a lot lower than it was in the summer and the snow is new. But, changing the settings fixed the issue.Pro's(1) Easy physical installation. I basically drilled a hole through my house, snaked the ethernet and power cables through the hole, into the mounting bracket and then screwed it to the outside wall. The cleanup to make it look pretty takes longer than the camera installation.(2) Since network configuration. I have had IP cameras on my property for the past 10 years. This camera's configuration process was very simple. In the past, I used Toshiba cameras, but recently I found that the ones I had been using were actually produced by Vivotek, so, when I went to set this camera up, it was a breeze as it was just like the others.(3) Durability. This camera feels like it is made to last. Build quality is good, but more to the point, I feel it isn't going to break of something bumps into it (tree branch, person on ladder).(4) Night Vision. Excellent!! This is my first camera with good night vision. I also purchased an IP8332C at the same time. They both work as advertised. 30 meter distance for the IR lighting is great. In the area where I'm using this camera, nothing can hide.Con's(1) It's a bullet camera. Yeah, I know, you're saying you shouldn't have bought it if you wanted a dome camera. True, but at the time, Vivotek didn't have a camera option that can do everything that my 'old' Toshiba IK15a did. The IK15a was a dome camera that allowed you to physically pan/tilt and zoom x4 optically. Having the ability to do more than ePTZ allows was nice. I miss it.(2) Motion Detection. I admit that I haven't spent enough time on this setting as I could. But, based on my prior experience with IP cameras (the IK15a, in particular), MD was set it and forget it. I didn't have to do much configuration. With this camera, I'm having more difficulty getting the settings to work every time. First off, when the sun comes out of the clouds, motion is detected, but I rarely capture the UPS truck when it delivers a package.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CO9G3OW"}}
