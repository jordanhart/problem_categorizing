I pulled the wire so hard I though I broke the inside but I risk it and connect the cameras and it work. I use this 1000ft to install 8 cameras in a midsize building and I bought more than I need it.

The one I replaced (different MFG/supplier) was exposed to the elements (at the connection) and rusted.  I sought to replace it with a solid copper power cord, but was disappointed to learn that it was the same as the one I was replacing.  I expect this too will rust after some normal outdoor exposure.  The copper braid is so thin it falls apart in your hand as you are attaching your connectors.  Yes, copper is expensive.  I guess I got what I paid for.  Had I had a chance to examine it before I purchased I would have bought another (probably more expensive) cable.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$97.20", "Features": "Ideal for Composite Video, RGBHV Video, Component Video and even Surveillance Systems\nAttached 2 Stranded copper 18AWG 7x0.385mm Black/Red Power Cable\nUL Listed 20AWG Center Conductor.
