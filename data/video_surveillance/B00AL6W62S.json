I decided to leave a review because of the amazing customer service I received. I was able to setup the camera easily; however, I had issues with my router. I created a ticket online and within less than 24 hours I received a response and my issue was resolved. I'm truly amazed by the service. I'm glad the service is just as good as the product itself. You got to have both. The camera is great for night and day time. I use it to check up on my 3 year old while he's asleep. Works great with my iPhone!", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great product and technical support", "Author": "Don", "ReviewID": "R3GZ2ZT0EJ9XRQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've tried a couple of cameras on the market but found the I.T. support to be inadequate or inept when it came to viewing my camera images with my I-phone (the goal), even though I was able to connect and view via my computer, . When I purchased the Togocam Mini, I contacted technical support and this time the I.T. specialists got my camera going and working well with the I-phone.  I liked it so well I purchased another camera.The technical support team was available to me during the day and night, (unbelievable),  I am very happy with both my cameras for I now have security in my home at a very reasonable cost.

When I got the camera I had difficulties installing it due to AT&T;'s hardware (I use AT&T; as my ISP). Long story short I tried to trouble shoot it myself and after playing with it for one evening unsuccessfully I reached out to their technical support. Derek was the guy who handled my case - he got back to me in 15 min after I opened a ticket and went out of his way to help me...He handled my case from the beginning until it was resolved and most importantly worked around my time vs 8-5 with 1 hour \"wait on line and next customer service representative will be with you shortly\"...This was by far the best customer service / technical support experience I ever had...Couple it with great product, I would buy from this company without hesitation. Even if you have AT&T; as ISP, just call these guys and you will be up and running in 15 min plus product quality is second to none for under $100...there is no better product in this price range!", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Simple wifi cam setup", "Author": "Todd Hope", "ReviewID": "RF9F4SZF95G8O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I gave it 4 stars because it was very easy to setup. The price was cheaper then other wifi cams. The quality of video is great for this type of wifi cam. I tested it for low light and night view and works very well with clear video. It even came with the camera wall mount and screws for dry wall which was great I didn't have to make a run to the closest home depot to buy extra mounting screws. It works great using my iPhone 5 and android tablet. The cool part I didn't have to change anything on my linksys wifi router to make it work except the normal picking of SSID and adding the password to it. Overall, Its a cool little cam and very easy to install.", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great product for a reasonable price", "Author": "Elena C.", "ReviewID": "R3L0JI3UI0BSEK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We got Togocam several days ago for my toddler's room and I can't help watching him all the time!My husband is a lawyer and spends a lot of time away from home, but now with the camera he can see our son playing, napping etc. My parents and in-laws have Togocam app on their smartphones too. They absolutely love to see their grandson!The only trouble I had after I installed it was no sound. So I connected the tech support which was very helpful and prompt. It turned out I had my IPhone on silent. After I switched to a sound mode I had both visual and sound.There are the things that I like about the camera:- clear picture during a day and night (even when it's completely dark in the room I can see everything!),- I can watch the babysitter when my husband and I go out,- my parents are able to see their grand son from another country,- I can move the camera to any room easily just unplugging and plugging it in (although I'm considering to get a couple more cameras),- low cost.So I would definitely recommend it! It's an awesome product for a very reasonable price.", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Highly Recommend", "Author": "S.

I love the freedom the Togo camera gives me when I am busy at home. I live in three 3 story flat and I can\u2019t always see who is at my door. The Togo Cam allows me to see a live feed from my phone 24/7. I don\u2019t have to run downstairs when the doorbell rings to see who is at the door. I can access the camera from my phone and that gives me a sense of freedom in my own home. The Togo Cam also gives me a sense of comfort and security because I don\u2019t have to answer the door for solicitors or neighborhood children unless it is a necessity. I would recommend this Camera to anyone!", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "wow... what an awsome product . I would truely be lost without it.", "Author": "tamca", "ReviewID": "R33MUO7EX5JI8X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the most helpful and amazing gadget money can buy. I am a single mother of two kids and things like going to the laundry room in my apartments to wash clothes is just one of many things that have become a challenging event all in it self now with two small children who cannot be left alone even while they sleeping. Which makes things very difficult for me to get things I need done. This camera is my way of being able to watch them while they sleep and be able to walk downstairs to do the laundry completely stress free of what if something happens in the 5 mins im not right there with my sleeping babies , because of the togo cam I can watch my babies on my phone as they sleep and know they are fine while I do the laundry. Thank you so much to the people who created this it has made my world 100% less stressful and made the impossible possible again. I highly recommend this product to anyone with children because knowing they are ok at all times is never a bad thing.", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Michal Hlavica", "ReviewID": "R1DKFY19AMNAN1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great product, very easy to install and runs really well. The installer is just one click of a button when you log in to their website. It finds the camera and installs it for you in a few seconds. Also Im very impress with the quality of video and audio streaming. Friendly app and my favorite feature is camera sharing with my folks in Europe.

We use this wood stove to heat our hot water and heat the house (those of you in the north know what I am talking about).  I figured the range was going to be borderline but I have a extender for my WI-FI network and the stove is attached to the inside of a barn (these are not all weather wi-fi cameras).  I would not suggest putting this camera outside in a un-sheltered location!Setup was easy with the installer.  It did appear that I needed to suspend my Norton as it did not know what this installer was.After the setup was done the range and the quality of the camera was great.  The Night vision ability was a plus for me.Net/Net for 65$ and this allowing me not to have to head out to check the Temp gauge on the wood stove in -20 degree wind chill only to find out the Water Temp is fine even a couple of times a winter is well worth it for me...", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Happy with my little camera. Great price too.", "Author": "Gabi", "ReviewID": "RHFCIP05RJS5S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a camera for my kids room and another for the backyard so that when I am out and about I can see whats going on at home when only the baby sitter is there. So I purchased two of these cameras and absolutely love them. Simple to install, works as described, no gotcha's or surprises. For me that alone deserves 5 stars. As a single mom, the last thing I need is to spend time learning something technical.I also added my parent's phone to the list so now they can see the cameras too.One of the nice features is that I do not have to unplug the indoor camera when I am not using it. Instead I just change the setting in the app to turn off Internet access to the camera and then turn it back on when I am leaving the house. Nice little feature.Over all its a good buy. I would suggest it to others.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little camera. Love the ability to turn off internet access.", "Author": "markopolo \"MarkoPolo\"", "ReviewID": "RJ6E883ET44K7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera a couple days back. I was initially looking for a baby camera but did not want to spend $200 on WiFi-baby or the other brands. So I got this instead.It works very well, indeed. Just like they say, no technical know-how needed, so I got it up and running in minutes. Once setup, all I did was download the app from Google Play or iTunes for my wife's iPhone and voila, it works! the picture is not bad, you can change some settings directly from the app, but the part I like the most, is that this appears to be the only camera that you can stop internet access to it. Switching it from the app the camera is no longer accessible from anywhere except your home WiFi network. For obvious security reason, this is a huge plus for me, especially since the camera is pointed directly at my baby's crib. Also I thought it was great that I can very easily share my camera with other family members. Worked out well.Also, I emailed the ToGoCam team, wanting to get some technical specs on the camera and I got a reply from Mike within a couple hours. So their customer service appears to be very responsive.Over all great camera especially for the price!
