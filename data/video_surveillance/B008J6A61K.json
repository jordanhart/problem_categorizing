Moore", "ReviewID": "R2ZFL6Z85XHNOD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I used this unit to replace a Lorex that was about 4 years old that was outdated, and had fans and hard disc that were failing. I mainly point this out because the DVR industry moves very fast in new features and does a horrible job of supporting its customers. A year old is enough to obsolete a box, and often support for older boxes is simply dropped.My installation is 9 cameras, a configuration that is not supported by anyone anymore. All available machines are now binary multiples of 4, 8, 16, etc. That's great, but for on screen multicamera displays, the natural numbers are 4, 9, and 16. In fact the 8 camera machines use a 9 camera (tic-tac-toe) display and leave one of the spots blank.Thus,  a 16 camera machine could handle the 9 cameras I have, and leave room for more cameras if I so desire in the future. The cost was roughly comparable to the original Lorex machine. I have the requirement for all cameras to have an alarm in feed, which is essential if you want to use external sensors to trigger the cameras or sent out alerts. This goes back to the fundamental fact of these machines. Although they try to get tricky and detect motion via the video signal, it just does not work. I struggled with that feature for months, and there is just no way to block out or ignore natural motions in the camera (leaves, shadows, etc.) and still have a system that detects motions you want (people). An external IR sensor is %400 more reliable, only detects objects with heat (like humans), and reduces your false triggers to effectively zero. Q-see makes machines without alarm inputs (in fact the first machine I got, which I returned, was incorrectly substituted for a no-alarm input machine by a seller who thought they were equivalent). Get the alarm input machine. You will be happy later.A great feature of the Q-see machines is they are USB mouse controllable. My last machine was front panel or internet controllable only. I use a monitor at bedside, but the DVR is in the living room, both because of hookups and the noise of the fan. I used a long distance USB extender (USB to ethernet cable repeater) to go across the house, and now I can fully operate the DVR from beside, a huge improvement. It is almost unfair to knock it for what they COULD have done with that feature, but trying to also run a keyboard, or multiple mice via a USB hub would have been nice. The keyboard for filling out text fields, instead of using mouse hunt-and-peck, and the multiple mice thing would have allowed me to have a mouse at several of the control monitor stations (I have 10 of them, one per room, fed from a distributor-amplifier). I DO notice that you can hook up a mouse to both the back and front USB connections, and use them both at the same time. I use this feature to operate the DVR both from my bedroom and from the living room.So far the machine does all the feature points I needed. I hooked the alarm ins to sensors, and I hooked the alarm out to a chime in the bedroom. I don't use a loud alarm for that because the system monitors outside cameras and the front door. Its just to alert when folks come to the door or move around the perimeter of the house. I have another system for inside the house. The software does have rough edges. For example, it has several output ports for the monitor, standard NTSC video, HDMI and VGA, but strangely only one at a time can be used for controlling the machine. The other ports just act as dumb displays, with the video only. Further, when first installing the machine, you have to hit a key on the front to \"select\" which display is the controller, and the display is blank until you do this. In order to find out even which key does this you have to look in a selection of the different machines they sell. This makes for a unnecessarily awkward install procedure.Another rough edge is that if you hit \"play\", it gives you a block of 1/2 hour to look back through. I love the fact that it can shuttle back and forth (move a pointer to anyplace in the timeframe), but the 1/2 hour window it according to the clock, and if you hit a place that is ahead of the current recording time, it brings up a dialog that says there is now video at that time. You have to dismiss it. Since it does not give you any indication of where in the shuttle pointer there is or is not video, you are left with guesstimation, trial and error. Hit that place in the shuttle. Whoops, no video. Dismiss the dialog, try again. I would have far preferred if it did nothing, flashed red, beeped, or better yet, showed on the shuttle where the recorded video was. Or better still, shown the last 1/2 hour of video by the shuttle that was recorded, instead of the last 1/2 hour rounded to the clock time (1:00, 1:30, 2:00, etc).My major knock against the machine is that the provided Qt-View application for android only displays 4 cameras at a time. There is no reason given for this limitation. Their I-Phone application can do all 16 cameras, and so can a Windows or Mac PC. Other applications can display more than one camera at a time, and I am trying to find a workable alternative application. This needs to get fixed.Other than this, there is stuff that just defies explanation, such as the fact that \"play\" under a windows browser calls for a codec that does not install correctly. According to customer support, you have to use the \"search\" feature. Its just weird and inconsistent.The machine does make noise, it has a fan, but the noise is not excessive. Its still the loudest machine in the stereo stack in my living room, so that could be improved (why does it need more fan power than the tivo or other similar appliance?).Overall, I am happy(er). If Q-See distributes some fixes for the remote applications  that work on this machine, I will border on ecstatic. Being told that I have to buy a brand new machine to get better software gets old fast.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$599.00", "Features": "16 Channel DVR / Real-time /  CIF/D1 Resolution / H.264\nRemote internet monitoring (up to 10 users at the same time)\nMobile Phone Surveillance\nCompatible with MAC and PC\nFree Q-See Apps for iPhone, iPad, and Android remote viewing!", "Name": "Q-See QT4516-1TB 16Channel DVR Real Time CIF/D1 Resolution H.264 Replaces QT426-1", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41TH-6mpNZL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008J6A61K"}}
