They use the name \"ATRIX\" to try and get people to believe that they are affiliated with Motorola, but their NOT. Second: when I ordered the camera they sent me a \"DEMO MODEL\" which had scuff marks, paint chips and fingerprints inside the sun-shield. Also, the focus wouldn't lock in. Then when I tried to get it replaced, they had the audacity to browbeat and interrogate me to PROVE I bought the camera from them. I had to take photographs, read off serial numbers and basically jump through hoops just to get a replacement.Now, I live in western Pennsylvania, where high humidity and rain is abundant. Even though the camera is under an roof eave, the new camera fogs up after a rain. Also the focus goes out on it about once a week.If I could give \"0\" stars I would. My personal suggestion is \"DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA!!!\" Spend your money elsewhere, because this manufacture and their cameras are JUNK!!!", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Long Range Camera", "Author": "M. Bone \"Gizmo\"", "ReviewID": "R13NLW8O8XTIX6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera so I could keep an eye on my entrance gate over 200 feet away. The 50mm zoom gave me a very sharp, crisp picture. The gate has a street light so the long range IR's are not needed. The low lux shows a excellent night picture. I'm very impressed with the construction of this camera. Well worth the money.", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Image Sensor: 1/3\" Sharp Color CCD; Signal System: NTSC; IR Distance: 200 feets; IR Lamps 6 Powerful Long Range LEDs\n700 TV Lines; Effective Pixels: 768(H) x 494(V); Minimum Illumination 0 LUX (IR on)\nScanning Area: 2:1 Interlace; S/N Ratio: >48~52dB; Electronic Shutter: 1/60 ~ 1/100,000 sec; Video Output: BNC, 1.0Vp-p, 75ohms\nSupply Voltage: DC 12V (Recommend 1Amp); Operating Temperature: 14\u00b0F to 122\u00b0F; White Balance/ AGC/ Backlight Compensation: Auto\nMounting Lens: 5-50mm Vari-Focal; Synchronous System: Internal; Gamma Corrections: 0.45; Water resistance: IP 65", "Name": "Atrix Night Vision Vari-Focal Weatherproof Bullet Camera 700TVL w/ 5-50mm Lens Long Range, Sharp Color CCD, IR Indoor/Outdoor Security Surveillance CCTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4172MkY9P9L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009B7U9Q8"}}
