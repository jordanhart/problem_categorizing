I install cameras so i know whats out there.The DVR is pretty decent, motion detection settings - you can \"blank out\" a high traffic area to stop constant recording - like cars on the street or a flag waving. apparently you can also hook it up to recieve photos and emails of camera triggers there are two outputs - PC and coax so you can hook up to your monitor and your TV's aux input if desired. you can control PTZ cameras as wellThe camera Power supply is Under rated once you load it down to its max capacity the cameras start flickering and switching between day.night. a stronger Amp power supply is needed to resolve thisthe cameras themselves are nice and small ( kinda cheesy mounting bracketry)  and their image quality is pretty darn good ( considering the price)  I would have to say that the 700 TVL claim is not realistic - more on the order 600 TVL, the Depth of resolution is ok at a distance but improves the closer one gets.  Its great for a specific area like a porch or a sliding door - but buy some better cameras for viewing a back yard.night vision operation is also pretty good - better than i expected. you can hear the day night modes change with a pronounced \"click\"'Overall,  I am happy with it.  The 4 provided cameras that i used indoors - i plan on buying better varifocal ones for the exterior", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very good for the price", "Author": "Jack Williams", "ReviewID": "R1GJNXQCCJOD8L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For a lower end system this is better than I expected.The software disk was not included with the system but a note inside gave a link to their web site for the download. The web site has detailed instructions for almost anything you might run across. Note that you might have to do a firmware update to the dvr but the file and instructions are also on the web site.Setup was very easy following the directions.Cameras are clear and give good color images.All in all, very good for the price.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works well for the money.", "Author": "Martha E.", "ReviewID": "R2ZDBSWZKVNVM6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Things to know. There is no hard drive. You must purchase one - thus the price is not so low. The manual is hard to follow due to poor English. The user ID is case sensitive. It will make logging in from the network impossible unless you spell the user name correctly. Mine arrived with a bad Sata drive data cable. Mine also would trigger all cameras to record, that were set to record, if motion was detected at any camera, even if that camera was not set to record. My Iphone dropped the camera if I changed the camera name. Don't know how to fix that yet. Parts of the playback system did not work well using the direct network connection. I had to trim back some of the rubber around the electric eye in order to get the camera to stay in normal color mode (not IR mode) when there was enough light. I have to leave the DVR off for as much as 20 min if I power down, before it will recognize the drive after power up. This unit is glitchy at best. Once up and running, leave it alone and it will work. I don't know about those great service calls, I never could find a phone number to call for service. I had to use a chat system and was assured the problem was my drive and not their DVR. I did not even try to request a new cable, I just bought a new one for $6.00. As with most items with a great low price, it is buyer beware.UPDATE 2/18/14  Go to their site and download an update to the DVR. It will fix a lot of problems and has for me. This fixed the hard drive issue and the all record when one camera sees motion. So far, it is a lot better than when I started. You will need to load the control software on your PC to get the best performance.", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great product!", "Author": "D.

The dvr held up all winter long in my garage in sub freezing temps and I was quite surprised.  The cameras are good quality out to 30ft.

Every time when I turn the power it shows me error message that there is not hard drive. And after a little wile it finds it.

It connected easily but had to be formatted using the on-screen GUI.  I didn't really read the manual but didn't really have any trouble with it but I'm in IT and I didn't need to set up any outside access/port forwarding on my router.  I dropped down the recording framerate to about 7 and was using a little over 30gb a day in storage so the drive should be good for a month before beginning to overwrite.  I created another admin account with full rights but it wasn't able to edit other user accounts so don't mess up the Admin account.  cameras seem good for the price and have an audible click when they switch modes to/from low-light/IR.
