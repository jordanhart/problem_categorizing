{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very easy setup, great picture quality", "Author": "Jen \"Geek Girl\"", "ReviewID": "R2FOXQ8LTS691J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My home does not really allow for a convenient wired security system and I'm not really a fan of cords being strewn about my house. Plus, I have my reservations about how secure wired systems are when their power can so easily be severed. With this wireless system, even if one of the cameras was discovered and rendered useless, the others are still fully functional. Also, given the wireless option, it's very easy to hide the receiver so that even if the cameras are destroyed, the receiver is still functional and has stored all the data.As for this particular model, it was exceedingly simple to set up. I had tried a previous wireless solution and the picture quality, while good enough to see what is going on in a completely dark room, was not good enough to identify facial features of the intruder. This system appears to have much better picture quality and in testing in a completely dark room from 40+ feet away from the camera, I could clearly see myself and my actions, and when coming closer to the camera, I could clearly see my facial features. I left it set up in total darkness for a few days and was able to clearly identify every person who entered the room. I also had the opportunity to test the cameras out in sub zero temps and after a few days found icicles forming on them, but no loss at all to picture quality. Definitely a quality wireless solution for smaller areas or as an addition to a larger system.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy setup but not completely wireless.", "Author": "Jerry Helsing \"jlhelsing\"", "ReviewID": "R22T6LH9MVZIXV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This system was actually not as easy to set up as I had hoped.  The problem is that although there are no wires that actually travel back to the DVR, it does require a 110V outlet to power the cameras.  Mounting these outside requires either an outlet be installed nearby or an extension cord running down the house and looking terrible.  Otherwise, the system was a cinch to setup.  Once I got the power situation figured out, I was able to setup the rest of the system in a matter of 30 minutes.  I cant say yet how the weather is going to affect the signal, but I can say that the picture is as good as other wired CCTV cameras I have used in the past and the fact that I didn't have to run cables allowed me to attach one of the cameras to my shed in the back yard.  Overall, for the price, this is a real nice system (so far).  My only complaint is that you just need to find a power source nearby to power the camera which is actually to be expected otherwise you would be changing batteries a lot.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "wireless....ahhhh", "Author": "funbear", "ReviewID": "R8JHLATIF41KJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "In some area of elecontronics, its incredible how reliable and good the technology is.... as well as the user interfaces...this is the result of selling 10's of millions of units per year.... that is not the case with electronics such as this.  I feared wireless cameras...while sometimes beneficial where you can not get wires, well, often, hard to get signal back to the main unit.  user interface is ok at best... I have tried many of these brands through the years.... they all have quirks, some less than others.... and, of course, the lowest priced units lack features and benefits on units costing 2x as much, so its a real buyer beware....  I think these units are 5 years away from getting a great system for $600 price range....", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00FYV8WGE"}}
