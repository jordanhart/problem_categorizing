{"Reviews": [{"Title": "High Quality System", "Author": "Fred E", "ReviewID": "R1VPI6H8KR3H5Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This system provides very good quality videos.  It is not hi-definition but very good for standard definition.  My only real complaint is that the seller does not send any instructions for installing the system and that it took  a while to get in touch with their tech support people because they were so busy, but once I did talk to them, they were very helpful including setting me up with access to my system via the internet or smart phone.  They did send me an onlink with some instructions - I wish they would have provided instructions or a link when they shipped the system.  However, their instructions are 12 links to 12 specific items and not a comprehensive instruction manual.  That is the main thing GW Security needs to improve.  I am very happy with the system.  It was a bit of a pain to run all the wires from the DVR to the 8 separate cameras, but that's to be expected with a system like this.  I like that this sytem comes with 500' of bulk siamese wire for two reasons: (1) this wire without end-connectors routes through mich smaller wall/ceiling holes than wires that comes pre-terminated, and (2) I can cut each wire to exactly the length I need and therefore there is no waste.  I used 488' of the 500' wire so it worked out great.  Lastly, I linke that the cameras I purchased are adjustable focal length (zoom) so I was able to set each one just like I wanted (most I left at full wide angle 2.8 mm which covers a lot of area - more than a 90 degree view).
