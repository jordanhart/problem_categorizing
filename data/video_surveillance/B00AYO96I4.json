The Wi-Fi distance when it works is about 6 feet max.The box arrived opened, the power USB does not work at all.Maybe I forgot something.... But the real price of this is about 15 dollars, not more.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dont waste your money on this unit.", "Author": "MrTech", "ReviewID": "R1S6BZQSHUCJV4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The one and only benefit of this cam is that it is small.  The fun stops there.  The biggest issue is that the battery lasts about 30 minutes, then you have to buy new.  I hacked mine into a robot rover which uses 2x 18650 batteries, which now gives it the power it needs.  Pic quality is not great, plastic is cheap.  Not easy to configure either.", "Date": "September 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "TERRIBLE!!", "Author": "heenalu5", "ReviewID": "RE00CUNSDSJ23", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This product was sold as new, but it looked like it had been opened. It didn't come with an English manual either. The seller sent me a link and I'm supposed to take my time paper and ink to print it out. Even still, the manual makes no sense. I can't use it with my computer or phone. And now the seller is not responding to my requests for a return. Save yourself a lot of headache and avoid this camera and seller.", "Date": "June 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow.. What a peice of crap!", "Author": "J.R.", "ReviewID": "R33V0KPSGA9YWF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First off I would like to say that this unit should be discontinued all together because of the lack of quality control. I opened up the box moments after the postman delivered it and tested the signal strength and found it loses signal completely after 6' or less without any interference or obstacles to affect it. After messing with it for a few weeks, trying to set it up on my existing wireless network wich requires an update, I found out this seller has sold  me an old or refurbished unit with a outdated, non updatable firmware for double what the manufacturer sells a new one with up to date firmware for. Im not sure if the firmware update adresses the range and lack of being able to connect to an existing network or not. If you are adement about having one of these units I would suggest purchasing straight from the manufacturer's website. go to  thumbdrive . com", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Virus", "Author": "Bonnie Kelley", "ReviewID": "R2S16R8TS53Y6F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got a virus on my computer from the software that you download to support the device.Don't buy this its not worth the hassle", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wrong pieces", "Author": "stephanie", "ReviewID": "R2JW27MJ5U2FQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I did not like this product.
