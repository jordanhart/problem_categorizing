{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera capable of a nice wide angle", "Author": "Dustin Bolton \"Dustout\"", "ReviewID": "R1KHY4DGWFM4BE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this to replace a similar style camera that did not have a variable lens.  I installed this about 1 foot up and to the right of my front door and adjusted it to give me the maximum wide angle view.  It works quite well for viewing all the way up to my front door which is nice in case someone is leaning up against it or a package was left outside.  Image quality seems very nice and the adjustments such as focus work well.  Focus is extremely sensitive so it can take a bit of tweaking but the wide range and sensitivity is very nice.  Night vision is good although I'd prefer it to be less focused.  This seems to be a common issue with these types of camera liking to have their LEDs spotlight rather than flood as much as I'd like.  I'm uploading a picture as well of my front door view although it's through the iPhone app so is of lower quality than the actual image the DVR sees.  All in all I like it and will probably get one for my back door too for the wider angle view.  If this had been available when I upgraded my other cameras I would have gotten this over the non-adjustable ones for several locations.  I'm hoping the infrared LEDs last as a lot of other brands of these types of cameras seem to have their nightvision LEDs burn out over time... time will tell.  Build quality is very nice.  The matte grey paint seems high quality and looks expensive.  I like it better than my other glossy black cameras.", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00AR3NDI6"}}
