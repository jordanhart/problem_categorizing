The View Anytime app is really geared towards security and administration.  You can easily record all events to the microSD card or just record motion alerts.  The records capture the video and audio.  You can remotely access the recorded events from the View Anytime app.Another neat feature this app offers that many others do not is the ability to tell you how many people are viewing the camera.If your internet can not handle the 720 HD video, you can lower the resolution all the way down to QVGA.What I couldn't figure out was how to view the camera from my computer.  And since View Anytime app doesn't have a VOX feature, this isn't going to replace my baby monitor.**UPDATE 2/1/2014**Cavalry sent me the viewing app for Windows and said they're currently working on a Mac version.", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "ALMOST PERFECT!  however excellent. much better than foscam", "Author": "Christopher Jackson", "ReviewID": "R11WSY7Q0MO25R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Your wife will thank you for purchasing this since its so easy to use and offers a nice security for your home. Im very happy with my purchase and plan on getting another unit for my front door.I have a Foscam and its so clunky to setup and its gets setup issues every once in while that i have to reconfigure. I only had the Cavalry IP cam for a few days but already I feel relieved at how easy it is to us. Im gonna ditch my Foscam. Once you try this IP cam you will not go back. 720P HD quality is excellent also.THE GOOD1. Excellent Video quality. The h264 works very nicely in wifi mode as well. 720P is nice and sharp.2. Ease of setup. The setup is by far the easiest I have ever encountered. It as simple as this:A: Plug in IP Cam into AC wall plug and use Ethernet cable to plug IP Cam in to router with Ethernet cable.B: Download the ViewAnytime App on iphone or android phoneC: Open App and select Add Camera Button. Make sure phone is on same Wifi Network as router and choose the Ip Cam that is available. Enter password: 000000. And click save.D: Still using the App click on the newly configured Ip Cam on App. Make sure it works by swiping left and right to move camera. Once satisfied, click the back button and click Blue Arrow button to configure Wifi. Click Advanced and then scroll to Wifi Section and Click. Choose the Wifi that the IP Cam is connected to and enter Password. Once complete touch the Join button and remove IP Cam Ethernet Cable cable from router and remove power plug and replug. Once IP Cam restarts it will be wireless connected.E: Place IP Cam anywhere in house and connect to wall plug. Voila! Your IP Cam is set. Super easy to connect.3. Infra-Red work very well. Images show up in sharp in black and white.4. Wifi works very well. I had the Cavalry IP Cam setup in the farthest away spot in my house and works well.5. Very easy to Listen and Speak on App. Sound quality of speaker is very good.6. The camera rotate very nice with app I can rotate almost all the way around and tilts amost vertically.7. The wide angle view doesn\u2019t distort the image8. You don\u2019t have to worry about complicated setup with dealing with setting up a DynDNS or Port Forwarding like Foscam. This is very straightforward and easy to useCons:1.  No Web User Interface. Can only use on smartphone or tablet.2.  Does not work with IP Cam Viewer App. Manufacturer app work great but it would be nice to see it integrated with IP Cam Viewer.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Literally took me 2 mins to download and connect.

Getting it configured with port forwarding was truly a pain in the bxtt.  Although I am not a network engineer, I have certain background of computer experience.  Having said that, getting the ports to open correctly did take some study time and trail and error to get it to work.  For a regular person without any computer knowledge, it would be nearly impossible.  My MIL's house has Verizon FIOS all in one modem and wireless router.  Getting that set up was even more difficult.Then it's choosing the best app for my iphone connection.  Went through at least 10 app and concluded Baby Monitor by Tiny Solutions to work the best.The downside of FI8910W was image resolution wasn't HD.I came across this Cavalry unit while browsing for my 4th camera on 720HD. Foscam FI9821W was the logical choice, but after reading all the positive review on IPC10010, I gave it a try.Literally, it only took me 2 minutes to get it hooked up and download the app for iphone.  I can't believe this.  How can they do this without messing with router port forwarding setting is fascinating.  Even my wife, who has no computer knowledge, can do this.  Plug in Internet RJ45 plug, plug in power, download the app from the app store, open the app and the app already detected the IP Cam.  It was done!Getting it connected was the most impressive part.However, this IP cam still has room to improve and truly compete with Foscam's full line of settings and functions.1)  The Green light under the lens was a bit annoying.  I wish there's option to turn it off.2)  iPhone screen couldn't be turned off while the app is running on the background.  (important feature for a baby monitor)3)  No email notification.4)  More expensive than Foscam FI9821W.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very easy to setup", "Author": "JC E", "ReviewID": "R1UQNF100330UW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got it working very quickly.
