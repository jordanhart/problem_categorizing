The main features I was looking for were a tiny screen and HDMI.  This monitor seems like the best bang for the buck there.  It works fine and even has a completely unnecessary remote.  The picture quality is fair at best.  Perhaps it is a conflict with the Mini; but it says it is putting out 720p.Works fine for my needs. But if you needed to look at this screen for any length of time, I would pass.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$159.00", "Features": "This device is suited for family and office used.\nDisplay Type: 4:3\nPixels: 800x600\nBrightness: 450 cd/m2\nViewingAngle Horizontal (left/right): 170\u00b0 (95\u00b0/95\u00b0)", "Name": "Sourcingbay 12inch Cctv TFT LCD Monitor Av/hdmi/bnc/vga Input", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Aj-cXQNHL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00A7OZ49G"}}
