I wasn't sure if it would work with Mac products, but fortunately it works fine on my MacBook Pro laptop.  I purchased it as a secondary keyboard to the one on my laptop, the number pad on this keyboard is good for accounting and spreadsheets - it's much better than the long \"row\" of numbers on the Macbook Pro's setup.The first time you plug this keyboard into your computer's USB port, there is a quick keyboard configuration that requires you to press a few of the keys to ensure it is properly calibrated.  After that, the keyboard is ready to go.  The keys are nice and have just the right amount of resistance.  The USB cord is long enough to accommodate just about any scenario.*NOTE: At the time of this review, the product photos show both a keyboard and a mouse.

First of all, there was nothing technically wrong with the keyboard. It's an inexpensive PS/2 keyboard and is most definitely a great value. For anyone who actually likes the layout out of the Enter/Backslash key, and the odd layout of the Home/End/Insert/Delete, then I would say go ahead and buy this keyboard. It is a fantastic value.The positioning and size of certain keys on a keyboard make such a huge difference in my typing. I hate keyboards that have a small backspace key. In fact, the reason I came to Amazon to find a new keyboard was to replace an old PS/2 keyboard I have (which otherwise works perfectly), but has a small backspace key. Every time I reach for the backspace key on that keyboard, I instead end up pressing the key to the immediate left of the backspace key.So I came to Amazon and did a quick search for \"PS2 keyboards.\" When I saw this V7 keyboard, and saw that it had the double-sized backspace key (which I consider standard/normal), I immediately ordered it without a second look.Mistake.Unfortunately the positioning of the Enter and Backslash key on this V7 keyboard is completely foreign to me. I am CONSTANTLY hitting the backslash key while trying to press Enter. And when I actually want to press backslash, I am instead hitting the Enter key.I only needed this as a secondary keyboard for an extra computer, so I thought I could live with it.But I can't. It simply isn't worth the aggravation. It's at least as irritating as having the small backspace key. So I solved one problem, but created a new problem that was equally irksome.I suppose I blame myself for not paying closer attention to the layout of the keys. For just a couple of dollars more, I found 2 other PS/2 keyboards here at Amazon. One by Microsoft - the \"Microsoft Wired Keyboard 200\", and one by Logitech - the \"Logitech Keyboard K120\". Both of those have, what I consider to be, \"normal\" keyboard layouts.For my own sanity, this V7 keyboard isn't worth the headache.", "Date": "May 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very nice replacement only issue is that the", "Author": "Steve Herndon", "ReviewID": "R6V26ATE6IY07", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very nice replacement only issue is that the , is printed as a ; on the keyboard.

Compared to the keyboard I got with my Dell desktop, this keyboard is only 1.5 inches less side to side and 2.5 inches more front to back.  It is about a half inch larger in both dimensions than the no longer available Logitech compact keyboard.Like the Logitech keyboard, the V7 has no extra space between the function keys and the numeric keys.  Given the deeper front to back size of both of these keyboards, it is difficult to understand this lack of the normal separation of these rows of keys.  Both keyboards lack the grouping of the function keys into groups of four.Again, like the Logitech keyboard, The applications menu key has been moved from the right side of the spacebar to the left.  The windows key is now the third key from the left rather than the second key as it is normally.  The difference in these keys is that the Logitech keyboard marks the windows key with a raised bump to help distinguish it.  The V7 keyboard lacks that distinction.A major difference between the V7 and the Logitech keyboard can be found in the cursor pad.  Logitech chose to use smaller slim keys for this purpose thus creating a cursor pad with a smaller footprint but with a bit more separation between it and the keyboard and numeric keypad.  The V7 uses normal size keys for this purpose, making them a bit closer to the adjacent keyboard and numeric pad and quite a bit more difficult to identify by touch.The V7 arranged the page up/down, home/end and insert/delete keys between the keyboard and the numeric pad.  The keys are in two columns of three.  Logitech moved these keys above the numeric keypad.  Neither positioning is very good.  With either keyboard, I tend to use the numeric keypad for these functions rather than trying to quickly find the misplaced keys.  While this is a toss up, Logitech did gain the advantage of not trying to squeeze these keys into the usual position and was able to provide a slightly larger separation between key groups in this area.The V7 keyboard has special Microsoft applications keys above the keypad.  Since these keys start applications, I'd prefer that they not be positioned where they may be hit while attempting to use the numeric keypad.  I much prefer the choice that Logitech made in using this area for the page up/down and home/end keys.While the key spacing of the V7 is normal, the key tops are not.  They are very flat and larger than normal.  There is very little space between keys.  This increases the tendency to miss the center of the keys, causing them to sometimes be hard to press.  The smaller gap between keys seems to increase the problem of junk making the keys stick and much harder to shake the junk out to unstick them.  I've had had a much greater problem with stuck keys on the V7 than I've had with any other keyboard I've used.  The little nub on the F and J keys are quite small, making them hard to feel when positioning your fingers on the keyboard.While the V7 keyboard is heavier than I've grown accustomed to, that added weight doesn't seem to indicate better quality.  Of the three keyboards I purchased, one was DOA.  Two columns of keys didn't function - the column of keys that include the 6 and 7 keys.  Add to that the tendency for keys on the V7 to stick, and you've got a very unsatisfactory product.All in all, I much prefer the Logitech keyboard to the V7.  Logitech seems to produce a higher quality product with far better ergonomics.  While I would like a good compact keyboard, the V7 just won't do.March 14, 2013:I had to drag out one of the surviving keyboards six months after replacing them with a very basic Logitech keyboard.
