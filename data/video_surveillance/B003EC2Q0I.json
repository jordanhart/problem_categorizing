Then when I got it after the weekend, there were no clear instructions except the poorly worded and badly illustrated box. It took me a half-hour to figure out how to open the door bell section, but after that and I loaded in the included battery and installed it, it was child's play. I must say, it did work very well, and I put the chime section on the wall in my office on a screw provided. It's loud, even on the \"medium\" setting, but it's supposed to be in order to do its job.This device is worth the money, and works very well. The entire experience was not perfect, sort of aggravating actually, but after getting the back of the door bell open, it went very quickly. Someone with better common sense or who is more intuitive could have set it up in 5 minutes.

I installed it about 100 feet away and it works perfectly. It has 3 volume settings. I chose medium. It says it has 10 chimes when in fact it has about 38. The first one is the usual ding-dong which is what I chose. The 2nd one has the same ding-dong followed by an unintelligible voice. The only word I could make out was \"door\". The rest of the chimes range from the traditional Winchester chimes to classical themes that are waaay too long, unless you are expecting Cleopatra to arrive carried by slaves. There are other \"spoken\" greetings. You can make a game out of trying to decipher what is being said. The only other thing I would have liked was to be able to record my own sounds.

We looked at the big box hardware stores then I went to Amazon to see what I could find.  This low cost wireless doorbell has three different volumes, the loud is very loud and the low volume is not really soft, but is loud enough to hear in any room of our house.  There are 38 different ring patterns including a Christmas song and there are several that are quite pleasant while others are quite annoying.We haven't had a problem with the signal getting from where we have placed the door bell button on our porch to the door bell ringer and we have chosen not to mount the chime to the wall, instead we have it put it on top of our cabinets in our kitchen so it is inconspicuous.

If you're looking for one with a classy sound, this isn't it, either. If you just want something well priced with many tones that is very loud, then buy this. Although it is unfortunate you can't just have one speaker for multiple doorbells, the speaker is quite loud so even though the speakers are in different parts of the house, you can hear all of them everywhere. There is also no volume control, so be advised. Interestingly, some of the doorbells ring more than one speaker, others don't. Probably a defect, but it works out for my family.

Hough", "ReviewID": "R20YV6C5UFHM5I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought two of these to put in our kids' bedrooms to \"ring\" them for meals and such when they are in their rooms distracted by electronics or friends, and no amount of yelling up the stairs can get their attention.  The units are plastic, loud (even on \"low\"), and, yes, the tones are annoying and \"tinny\" sounding, but the kids liked choosing their own tone, and \"Happy Birthday\" and several Christmas tunes are available to change things up in the future.  My concern when ordering these--since they do not have a \"band\" switch--was that both units would be operated by ONE doorbell button.  This is not the case.  Each unit--ringer and doorbell--have a UPC-like code sticker on them (instructions indicated to make sure the stickers matched each other)--and, fortunately or by design, our two units had different codes on them, so I can ring my son's room without also activating the chimes in my girls' room and vice versa.  Both the ringer and the doorbell operate on batteries that are accessed by opening the BACK of the units, so I used 3M double-stick mounting tape on the BOTTOM of the ringer and propped/stuck the unit on top of the wooden molding on each kids' closet--I didn't want to have to drill holes to hang the unit, and I didn't want to use mounting tape on the back of the unit which I would need to remove from the wall and risk damaging the wall when the batteries needed replaced.  Overall, even only having the units for a little over a week, we love them, and even if they only last a year, I would probably buy replacements ever year at this price--the peace of not having to yell is worth it, and the kids love it when they get an opportunity to \"ring\" for their brother or sister. Lastly, our doorbell buttons are hung in our 1st floor kitchen and the ringers/chimes are pretty much directly overhead on the 2nd floor, so I cannot speak much to range.  Both the blue doorbell button light up as well as a little green rectangle light on the ringer when activated (but the little green light will probably not get anyone's attention unless they are looking directly at it when it's rung--however, again, the chimes are loud--realizing that we are only looking to \"ring\" one room and not an entire house).

It's not obvious, so your visitor, even if he cared, wouldn't notice it.  When that happens, the bell doesn't keep ringing, but it does discharge the battery in the button (which is an expensive and not easy to find type).  This is not an anomaly, as I have seen that other reviewers reported the same problem.It does not come with instructions.  By itself, not a huge crime, since these things should be intuitive enough to figure out, but still, instructions would be nice!When the battery is not discharged, it rings loudly and has a lot of different options for sounds to play.  I'd prefer one that functions properly even if it only says \"ding dong\" and not clips from La Cucaracha, Happy Birthday, and Mozart.It is cheap and flimsy, but given the price, that could be forgiven if it functioned well otherwise.

My two complaints are: 1. When I received the package, it said not to place \"in rain or direct sunlight\".  Being an outdoor doorbell, that's really my only option, so I've gone ahead and placed it near my door, so I'll be curious to see if it'll hold up in the winter during our \"rainy season\".  And 2. to mount the doorbell was a double-sided sticker pad.  I mounted it this way, only to find that it fell off the wall a couple weeks later (maybe due to the rain?), so I then saw there are screw 'notches' that indicate a place to screw it down...so that's what I did to make sure it's more secure.
