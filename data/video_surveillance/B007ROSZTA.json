{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good camera, good system", "Author": "Carmelo Pena-gomez", "ReviewID": "R2YKJJEG6EHJYU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the whole 2 camera-monitor set and had problems with one after 5 months of use, They sent me a replacement and works fine. Only bad thing is at night moving objects are not clear. A moving person looks like a ghost. A moving car looks like a space ship from Star Wars. Signal gets weak sometimes and one camera can lose signal for up to 30 minutes. But overall is a good system, keeps lurkers away scared and keep my house safe.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "I Did Not Like it", "Author": "Paul H.
