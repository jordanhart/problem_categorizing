My plan was to set the system to send these notifications to the email address of my text inbox, so they would arrive as text messages on my phone (most if not all cellular service providers have a email-to-text protocol, such as 1112223333@text.att.net etc.). The motion-activation on these systems is a joke. On its least sensitive setting, it simply cannot be used outdoors. The system is set up so that one can limit motion detection to one or more squares on a grid in the field of view of each individual camera. This is an excellent idea, but it is rendered useless by the constant false detection of motion on even the least sensitive setting, even when the camera is installed in a locked, empty room, with no (vertebrate) movement and only the slightest changes in lighting throughout the day (such as the garage of my unoccupied \"vacation\" home).The video quality is terrible. It is easy to get excited about having any remote video access at first, such that one can wishfully overlook this problem. But it doesn't take long to realize that these cameras are terrible, and they have no good reason to be in this day and age. In broad daylight, even at optimal contrast and brightness settings, it can be shocking how easy it is for a human being to hide within the field of view. The cameras then switch to infrared when there is still plenty of light out, which can either improve or drastically worsen the image, depending on the proximity of the objects in the field of view. If one object is very close, the infrared light illuminates it so brightly that nothing can be seen beyond it. I wouldn't complain about how terribly blurry these cameras are if I had not seen how crystal-clear and excellent other cameras can be despite operating within the same operating constraints. I also use two wireless IP cameras by Foscam, and I access live video feeds from them as well as from this Lorex system over the 4G on my iPhone or my iPad or my computer. I am amazed by the Foscam picture, as I am by the effectiveness and eerily intelligent discrimination of the Foscam's motion detection, its email notifications, its ability to blend infrared with full-spectrum, and most of all, by its image clarity, even transmitted over 4G. Not to mention that the Foscam transmits excellent audio, and can be remotely panned and tilted in virtually every direction right on my iPhone, wherever I am with a cellular data signal. It also has tech-support available during hours in which homeowners are likely to be tinkering with their camera networks.Lorex's customer service is unavailable on the weekends, and based on the East Coast, blocking access of all of Lorex's customers on the west coast of the United States at 2pm daily. What's worse, the attitude reflected by this policy and evident in the tone of recorded messages is even irritatingly expressed in the manners of the guy they have on their automated messages. When I needed help with my system early on a Friday afternoon, hearing that guy over-enunciate the word 'technical' for the eighth time in connection with the bad news that I would not have access to this service until the following Monday, made me blast lava from my nostrils and years.There are a couple of extra considerations that I should mention for the sake of completeness. This Lorex system is a DVR; it records the video and makes it available for later playback. The wireless IP cameras I use email me still shots of detected motion and can be set up to upload video upon motion detection via FTP to a server, but I have not attempted to set this up yet. The Lorax system has not failed me in this capacity, except in a way that is mostly my own fault. I believe that the manual should do a better ob of emphasizing the importance of setting the DVR to have a static IP address in order that the router does not give the system a different IP address in the event of a brief power failure. As luck would have it, my DVR was not set to continually record, and my access to it had only days earlier been cut off by an extremely brief power failure when my property was broken into. It probably wouldn't have made much difference because the video quality would almost certainly be insufficient to identify a burglar anyway, but still, I might have by chance taken a look at the cameras when the burglars were casing the house. I now rely on the Foscam wireless IP cameras (order them from Amazon, don't bother like I did with any of the familiar-branded junk available for purchase at Fry's or elsewhere) to notify me immediately if anybody is in my house. I have not yet set up one of these cameras for detection of outdoor movement, but I plan to do so, and expect it to perform excellently.", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,499.95", "Features": "Detail you can depend on.
