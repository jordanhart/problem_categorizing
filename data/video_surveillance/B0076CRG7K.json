Most of mine are mounted in silcone sealed project boxes for outdoor camera mounts, and have been in operation for more than a year with out any problems. My longest runs are 500-680 feet, and they are as good and clear as the 100 foot runs with these Baluns. Any problems I had were mainly due to my rushing and making a minor wiring mistake. Thses work just as well as the Baluns ive used and seen for $5-30 dollars more.", "Date": "July 20, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$13.99", "Features": "Power signal up to 750ft (250m) in pairs;\n12V/24V, DC/AC; No power required<br>\nBuilt-in TVS for surge protection;Exceptional interference rejection", "Name": "Q1C1 1-Channel Passive Video & Power Transceiver", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Orfb9d3nL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0076CRG7K"}}
