You will need a mini-USB cable or microSD card reader to get the videos out though. All around, can't complain, pretty good.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "I liked how I was able to connect the pen to ...", "Author": "cindy", "ReviewID": "R2J3U7X6OQ8JT9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received the spy pen and have been playing with it. The videos record in much higher quality and resolution than the other spy pens I've used in the past. I liked how I was able to connect the pen to my computer with the USB cable to view my videos and pictures. I also liked the silver color vs gold color pens but that's a personal preference.Pros:- Very high quality video resolution, it records in 720p HD.- 8GB SD Card included- USB cable included for easy and quick connection to computer to view videos and picturesCons:- Pen wasn't writing, not sure if it was just mine but wasn't my main purpose for buying it.- Slightly bulky, I prefer smaller pens- Took a couple tries to get video to record.Overall, I love this pen for the amazing video quality. Others I've bought claim HD quality but later found out the video to be very grainy.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy to use 720p Spy Pen Does it All!  Move Over, James Bond & Q", "Author": "DasShopaholic \"Out-of-hand shopaholic\"", "ReviewID": "R1P18JLFNQLJBK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received news that LiBa was going to release this product in time for the holiday season, and I couldn't wait to purchase and finally get my hands on it.  Having grown up with James Bond & Get Smart, why wouldn't I be intrigued by a spy pen that records both photos & videos?  It's like a childhood dream come true, 50 years later!It's quite amazing how sneaky this spy pen is.  Other than lacking any boutique branding, this pen looks like a Cross or a Mont Blanc at first glance.  The thick chrome ring in the middle of the pen is one giveaway that it isn't a fancy $100 pen.  I was also quite impressed with the weight and balance of the pen, as it felt like a substantial writing instrument.It may be easy to imagine how a pen with a single button may end up being difficult to operate, but to my surprise, the instructions explained it clearly, and I was capturing photos, videos, and even using it as webcam in no time.  In video mode, the spy pen records both video & audio.I think this spy pen may be one of the few on the market to record in 720p.  I can confirm that, when playing back the recorded video with VLC Media Player on my Windows notebook, that the Media Information does report back as 720p.  Also, the indoors and low-light performance were decent.It was very easy to connect, browse, and download files from the pen to the computer.  It shows up as an external storage folder in Windows.  No need to fight with irritating driver & software issues just to access your files.  LiBa's software was simple enough.I've been writing less and less over the years due to computers, but this high-quality feature-packed spy pen may make it more fun & interesting to start writing a lot more.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works as Advertised!", "Author": "James Reese \"Chevalier James\"", "ReviewID": "R33UX4M8U0ZQ1U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This spy pen records decent still pictures and videos with sound!

I've tested this pen for more than 3 weeks and it has not fail me.  Quality build and the pen writes perfectly.  Pen comes with a mini 8GB SD card (Kingston brand) and a 31\" USB/mini USB cord.  Picture quality is amazing on this little thing.  Snapping a picture is simple and captures right away.  No waiting.  Video and sound quality is amazing too but don't move too fast with it because video can get choppy.  The instruction manual was very easy to follow.Super fast shipping and the item is well packaged.

It isn't truly HD 720p quality. It is 640\u00d7480 with 1280\u00d7960 pictures. My pen cost me around $21 for the pen with 8gb micro SD card.

I tested the recording feature, then tried to connect the pen to the laptop via the supplied USB cable. It connected the first time, but wouldn't reconnect after using it further.
