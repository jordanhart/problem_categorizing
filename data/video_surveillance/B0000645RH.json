The Driveway Patrol fixed all that. Setup about a foot or less off the ground in a relatively sheltered location by the front door, it does a great job of watching the front of the driveay and the front door. I originally set the sensor up to look down the entire length of the drive but it proved much too sensitive for this to be useful so I aimed the sensor low ACROSS the driveway near the front door and this has worked out fine. It now tells me when the cat is ready to come in as well as when a pizza or package delivery has arrived.The Driveway Patrol actually saved me quite a bit of trouble one day when I had been waiting the entire afternoon for the cable guy -- he eventually showed up late, didn't even bother to knock or ring the bell and only stayed just long enough to leave a note telling me I wasn't home. Due to the Drveway Patrol, I managed to wave him down at the end of the drive. This alone made the gadget worth the price.As I've said, the Driveway Patrol does exactly what I need it to do. The only false alarms I get are from visiting neighbor cats, racoons and the odd bird. The only things I would change about the gadget would be to add a volume control that had more settings than 'loud' and 'very loud' and the fact that the chimes will ring continuously while being triggered and then for another 10-15 seconds beyond that.", "Date": "March 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great wireless alarm -- except when the temp is over 90 degrees!", "Author": "Linda", "ReviewID": "RHS6E5J78E00D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE OF MY REVIEW DUE TO JULY 2006 HEAT WAVE: I have two of these low-cost alarms set up, and both become quite intermittent when the temperature reaches 90 degrees and above (in the shade): Sometimes they go off when a person/car goes past, and sometimes they do not.

Houston \"Legal Eagle\"", "ReviewID": "R2UJJJFH9LORL6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had 2 of these units for years and both work OK. I use them to monitor for people at the side door of my law office. Having had 2 of them for years I offer these tips. First, the outside motion sensor takes a 9 volt battery and you should use only lithium batteries in the outside unit as lithium batteries are not as temperature sensitive as regular batteries, which perform poorly when cold.  Lithium batteries are more expensive up front but they last 5 to 7 times or more longer than a regular battery.  With the inside receiver unit you can use whatever battery type you prefer or an AC/DC adapter. The inside unit needs 3 \"C\" size batteries.  Second, some reviewers have complained that the unit goes off for no reason.  We found that flying insects were setting off the unit by flying near it.  My solution has been to spray flying insect killer around the unit every 2 weeks or so in the summer.  That works for us.  Others might want to adjust or reduce the sensitivity of the motion detector by placing black electrical or other suitable tape over the sensor window.  But rest assured that if an insect flies into or on the sensor, it will set it off.  That is probably true for any motion detector, no matter what the price.  To be sure, there are better quality units on the market, but not at this price.  Once we switched to a lithium 9 volt battery in the sensor unit and wiped out our flying insect problem about a year ago, the units have worked perfectly.", "Date": "July 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Thrilled with Driveway Patrol", "Author": "D.

I like the idea of placing it in a bird house to. Would protect monitor against weather and would be be able to cover of areas without being noticed.  We live in the woods at the end of our road, our neighbors drive forks off from ours on the hill just above us, I was always hearing cars but couldnt tell which way they went, since trees in our yard block the veiw I couldnt see either. We also have sneaky neighbors that I thought prowl around at night.While I would have preferred that we could have placed it further up the driveway near the fork, we felt it was safer to place it nearer our home.

During that time I have experimented with placement to get the best balance between false alarms and not picking anything up so here are some tips I have found.Sensor placement;1) Avoid pointing toward rising or setting sun as you might get false alarms in the morning or evening. Also if it is in a place where the shadows of tree leaves moving on the lens will give you false alarms also.2) As most PIR detectors, they are least sensitive to objects moving toward them as opposed to side to side so keep this in mind when you place them.3) I found that a height of 7 feet works well in an open area like a yard or parking spot and 5 feet if you want a small area like doorstep small deck.4) Make sure the sensor is mounted very solid so it will not move. I use the mounting hole and velcro on the back.5) Although I have done it, These units are not sealed enough to just hang out in the weather as water will eventually seep in through the front lens or where the case mates. I run a small bead if silicone around the case joints and along the bottom of the lens area and case to keep the driving rain out and have several that are attached to a telephone pole for two years and are still working. Or you could put it in a birdhouse in the right application.Range of the unit.I consistently get 300 feet or more with these as long as the sensor and reciever are placed well.1) The sensors antena is in the back of the unit so if it is pointing in the direction of your reciever the range will be reduced by almost half in my experience. Side on works ok but if your looking for range beyond 200' you wont get it unless its at 45 degrees or straight on.2) DO NOT mount the unit on anything metal or have metal between the sensor and the reciever otherwise your range will be greatly affected, this goes for the reciever as well.3) The less things that are in the path of the sensor and the reciever the better. I like to put the reciever/s in a window on the same side of the house as the sensor for the best results.4) Battery condition in sensor affects range.Limitations1) come on guys, its a $15.00 unit! , you cant buy a good PIR detector for less than $40.00 let alone wireless and a reciever. It's not human presence detection system. Place the units correctly and it will give you a pretty good idea if someone is around or comes in the driveway.2) Since it relies on changes in the heat signature, it might not pick up a car that was sitting in the sun all day and the same teprature as the the area in front of it. Its pretty good especially if the car drives by the unit not toward it. Its a $5.00 sensor element if that but works well for what it is.3) I have only had one bad unit out of about a dozen so thats not bad but you can get a bad one. Just ensure you go through the tips above before you give up on the unit.4) if you buy multiple units it is hit and miss with the frequency settings which you cant change. You might get 3 units that work with the same reciver or have 1 that only works with its reciver. I have six right now working on two different recievers so one is the front of the house and in the front window and one for the back.I hope this helps anyone with these units out.Cheers.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Driveway Patrol", "Author": "E.

I painted mine a dark grey so it can be placed out of sight in a convenient shrub.  That actually worked out very well; its now almost invisible, and yet, can still detect passing people and cars.2) Birds set it off during the day, as do our dogs.  We have large dogs that love to use the driveway as a highway and since they stand quite tall, they set off the alarm as they run by.However, I think the device is well worth the effort and cost.  I sleep better knowing I have some way of hearing what is going on outside since our dogs don't always bark.

It was positioned facing north so that the morning-thru the day-to afternoon sun would not affect it.  I also painted the outside with 'reflective coating' (i.e. Kool-Coat) since I live in AZ.  Cut a notch in the front to allow rain drainage. [see Product views for pic of unit as mounted]I get few false alarms with this config, but some from large white trucks/vans traveling past the front road which is about 150' away from the back fence.***I believe that this device monitors heat via IR (infrared) or NIR (near-infrared) and integrates the 'window' that it monitors, allowing for 'slow-changing' ambient conditions w/o alarming, but looking for a relatively 'quick change' to alarm. Standing still in one spot wont cause the sensor to re-alarm until their is movement once again. Besides movement, blowing trees/shrubs causing 'moving' (or modulated) shade/sunlight across the area being monitored could yield false alarms.  I have had 'none' at night while sleeping, and so the white truck/van alarms during the day time must be from reflected sunlight..(?).I'm happy with this device (found a stray 120vac to 5vdc power supply in my pile of used P.S.'s from old electronic devices to use with the Monitor unit), and with the housing/positioning I used to mount it which has paid off...It is 5 Stars for the price, but is 4 Stars for the function, and needs some more discriminatory 'smarts' in the electronics to be both a sensitive but yet fewer false alarm sensor/monitor system---which of course would drive the price higher.Pic of Sensor mounted:  [see Product views for pic of unit as mounted]*** [1 mo later: have noticed that 'fast-moving clouds' going across the sun will also give occasional false alarms.

For the money, you can't beat it.  I was worried about battery life, so I bought a Chamberlain system.  This Driveway Alert EXCEEDS the Chamberlain's range and picks up people and cars better than the Chamberlain system!I am currently getting an easy 100 feet range from transmitter to receiver from this product and it has yet to \"false alarm\" on me and has yet to not recognize a person in it's range.  That range would probably be longer but at 100 feet, it has to transmit through two insulated walls with steel doors in my garage and through my insulated house wall to reach the receiver in my home.The Chamberlain's transmitter detection range is good for FIFTEEN FEET MAXIMUM!  This system easily exceeds that range to nearly double.  I quit testing it at approx. 25 feet.  Thats all the range I need from the transmitter.  It may pick up even further.  The pick-up range from the Chamberlain transmitter is LESS than this unit!This receiver has a jack for AC use in order to bypass battery use.  I have ordered an adapter for this.  It ran me ten bucks, shipped.  The 9 volt batteries in the receivers are still going strong and I think they will last quite a while before they will need new ones.  I have two of these units equaling two transmitters and two receivers.  This cost TEN DOLLARS less than HALF of what the Chamberlain unit cost me!  I paid $89.00 for the Chamberlain unit with one receiver and two transmitters.I tested both side by side and this system is better and by far more reliable.  The receiver has a hi/lo volume control and lights up better than a Chamberlain receiver does, plus the sound is a chime rather than an annoying buzz that you can barely hear.  The Chamberlain receiver doesn't offer ANY sort of volume adjustment.I'm not sure how they handle rain, but there is a rubber gasket surrounding the battery door.  The Chamberlain unit doesn't even have a gasket on their transmitters.  You can be creative and make a bird house to put the transmitter in, as one person on here said, or you can mount the transmitter under a ledge or make a little \"roof\" over it to keep water from getting on it.  I use mine for inside use, but as I said, I have tested them back to back outside and the performance beat the Chamberlain system.There IS an led light on these transmitters that lights up whenever it has been tripped.  I think it is there so the owner can check it at the transmitter to see if it is in need of a battery change.  If you don't want the light, I would put a piece of tape over the led.  On the Chamberlain system the trip light led is BEHIND THE SENSOR SCREEN and there is NO WAY I know of to get it to stop lighting up because if you put tape over the sensor screen of their transmitter, you are covering it and making it impossible to pick up anything.This system is great and works great and is 1/4 the price of a Chamberlain system!  You may want to buy an AC adapter for the receiver to save money on batteries.  In my opinion and from my testing of both systems, this one is the winner, hands-down.

This seems to cause these units numerous difficulties, and should have been addressed in the Patrol Sensor's enclosed instructions -- but isn't.

The infrared sensor works on line-of-sight.  In other words, it must be in the open where it can \"see\" the moving object.  When triggered, the sensor sends a radio signal to the receiver/alarm.  Radio wave goes through obstacles and, therefore, the receiver/alarm can be located behind walls.  Metal objects reflect radio waves.  Keep the receiver/alarm away from them.  The 400 feet range is quoted prominently on the box; I can't confirm that because my receiver/alarm is only 25 feet away from the sensor and, at that range, it works perfectly.  The sensor works on a 9-V battery, whereas the receiver/alarm operates on three 1.5V C-batteries.  There is a power-input socket on the receiver/alarm for an optional AC adapter at 4.5V (not included).  A switch at the side allows the user to turn the alarm off or set it on either \"HI\" or \"LO\".False alarms are frequent, but most of them are caused by environmental factors - loose object waving in the wind, swaying tall grass, or moving foliage.  Even direct sunlight and moving shadows can cause false alarm.  At night, it is mostly small animals - cats, raccoons, etc.  It is up to the user to eliminate these environmental factors as much as he can, like mounting the sensor high enough so that small animals can pass under without triggering the alarm, keeping the sensor out of direct sunlight, securing moving objects in the wind, etc.Some reviewers complain about early breakdown of the units, but that is contrary to my experience.  I bought a kit in a store close to 5 years ago and it is still working.  I just bought two more at Amazon and you can't beat the price.

Narrowing the sensor's field with tape to less than ten percent open resulted in no alarm when needed, while about 15% open still gets lots of false alarms. I have tried many different positions and apertures with no better results.

This seems to cause these units numerous difficulties, and should have been addressed in the Patrol Sensor's enclosed instructions -- but isn't. However, by simply shielding the outdoor sensor from all *direct* contact with the light of the sun by using tape or opaque plastic, or repositioning the outdoor sensor, appears to eliminate false alarms or no alarms).

One of the negative things I read about was many false alarms.  I too experienced many false alarms mostly due to the sunlight effect.  I took a lesson from the outdoor security camera folks and added a shade for the lens.  This consisted of a six inch long piece of 4 inch pvc pipe.  I cut a small piece out of one side of the pipe end, approximately one and a half inch,  to accommodate the sensor and used it to protect it from the suns rays.  This may shorten the width of the sensor pattern but it is working much much better.  It also gives the sensor more protection of the elements that may damage it over time.  I only wish that the manufacture could employ a different audio alert for different zones.  I have three installed and will now order 2 more.  The problem being I do not know which sensor is going off.  You know, Mr. Driveway Patrol engineer, by modulating your carrier  with a tone switch say one thru 5 would help much.

Barber", "ReviewID": "R1KQXYJI13L4LS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I needed an alarm to alert me to people arriving at my walkway. They're not always seen, or their arrivals heard.I was pleased by the unexpectedly low price of such products, but there are issues. First, the batteries. I used to be able to just buy one battery at a time, but for marketing reasons I suppose, most battery makers now ship batteries in multiples of two. Since this product needs THREE C-sized batteries and ONE 9-volt battery, it's a costly double irritation.I ended up spending as much on batteries as I did for the product. I should mention that the receiver has a jack for a standard AC power adaptor. The requirement is 4.5 volts. No indication of current requirements but I'm confident that 100 mA would be sufficient. Incidentally, the standard type connector is center-positive.The receiver is fairly heavy with all those C-sized batteries. It has a slide-switch with three settings: Off, Alarm Low, and Alarm High.The alarm tone is pulsing and sounds rather like: de-dahhh....de-dahhh...de-dahhh. It's a medium pitch, I'm guessing about 600 Hz.At the lower setting, the volume is about like a doorbell or telephone. Expect to easily hear it from the next room. At the higher volume setting it's more aggressive. Not smoke-alarm loud but more like a loud telephone. It should be discernable throughout a first-floor house.For the hearing impaired, it should be noted that the receiver also has a bank of fairly bright LED's which flash red with the alert tone.One major irritation is that the 9-volt battery compartment is screwed shut. Two screws. A foolish flaw and I predict most people will simply toss the battery cover away. Both the receiver and transmitter have a simple screw mount for wall-hanging. Two wood screws are provided. The mounting hole is shaped like a slotted keyhole. The screw enters the round hole and slides into the slot. You have probably seen the same mount on many wall-clocks. It should be secure enough but there is no provision for tilting the units on either axis. Flat mounting against a wall or post should be anticipatedA door-hinge might make a suitable adjustment gimmick, if desired.One question that I asked previous owners about, is whether or not the unit can \"see\" through glass. I received several replies. One fellow said yes, another said no. It might have to do with double-glazing or the heat reflecting metalized films, found in many well insulated windows. I went with a sheltered outdoor mounting. The distance between the transmitter and receiver here, is about 75 feet. It looks further. Reception appears to be excellent. I have noticed that the transmitter has a fairly narrow field of view, perhaps 25 degrees.Keep in mind that it does not key on visible light or apparently, passive daylight such as doors opening. It seems to see only body-heat in motion.For my needs it seems to be an ideal solution and I'm quite satisfied with it, but the battery issue is a real pain. Amazon has some great bargains on batteries in bulk purchase but when you only need a few....P.S. A quick update. I did find the current requirement for adaptor operation on a small pamphlet. It's 500 mA.

I learned this after spending $180.00 on ScatMats.Cats are smart critters and learn quickly.

I tried placing the ScatMats on the floor but they'd jump over them.I read countless reviews on electric-eye devices that spray. None were without problems and the refills are expensive.Mount the DRIVEWAY PATROL alarm facing into the room about light switch high at the room entrance so you can easily turn the switch off before entering the room. Set the electric eye sensor on the floor next to a wall a few feet inside the room.At first, the cats will casually enter the room and walk past the alarm and curiously inspect the weird new thing on the floor. That's when the training session begins. Unless there's another entrance, they have to run toward the screaming monster to escape. The alarm only lasts 3 seconds. That's ample time for them to be all the way in the back of the house with enough momentum to go into orbit.We haven't had a cat in the kitchen at night in over 4 weeks.

Double sided mounting tape would work, but makes it hard to change the batteries.  Three inch hose clamps with half inch metal staples work great. I put a light coat of clear silicone caulk on the inside of the hose clamps and a strip around the Driveway Alert. Let the caulk cure for 24 hours before assembly. The silicone caulk makes the connection more \"grippy\".  Less likely to slip out during installation or battery changing.Have tried a few locations.  Works great next to the door on the porch.  In the shade and protected from sunlight.  Cat sets it off so we know when she wants to come in!Ended up putting it on the north facing end of the house near the top of the garage doors.

At 60 feet out, the sensor will ignore cars passing at about 30 mph but pick up slow-moving cars and larger vehicles such as trucks. Placement and aiming is critical to success and requires some thought and experimentation to avoid unwanted alarms.I have experienced many \"false\" alarms, as others have here. This seems to occur more frequently on partly cloudy days when the sun suddenly peeks through the clouds. Windy days can produce unwanted alarms when things are moving in the breeze. The product should have an adjustable sensitivity like on a motion-controlled lamp. If the sun is shining directly on the sensor, the units can go crazy with false alarms. They should be shaded from direct sunlight.I want to clarify some misinformation about using several sensors together. You can use several sensors with a single receiver, or have the sensors trigger multiple receivers only if they are all on the same frequency.The frequency is apparently determined by the Part. No. which is found on the back of the receiver. You cannot tell by looking at the box, so you need to open the box and remove the unit.I have two sets marked Part No. 0790RX, which work together. The third is marked Part. No. 0790-3 and uses a different frequency. I use the 2 matching sensors in the front of the house to trigger one receiver. I use the third sensor in the back. This way I can tell from the receivers if the movement was in the front or back of the house.I need to turn off the receivers on partly cloudy and windy days. I have a couple of unused wall-switch-controlled outlets which I use to turn the receivers on/off by powering them with HOSA universal A/C transformers instead of batteries. Like many others here, I found that the units DID NOT work when you plug a power supply into the jack. I opened the units and found that the circuits were different from each other and that neither was properly wired to allow operation with a power supply, even though there's a connector. I had to add a jumper between the negative terminal at the batteries and the negative terminal of the power jack to make it work. Essentially, the power supply jack and battery terminals need to be connected to each other in parallel.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Purchased 4, 5 months ago and can write a review now", "Author": "Wayne E.

After receiving them, As usual I had to take one apart to see how it could be waterproof.I was impressed with the design for the cost. Putting it back together I noticed a o-ring {rubber washer} same as on the battery door I coated both with Vaseline for a better seal and extend the life of the rubber.2 was placed in the weather and 2 was placed under cover. The 2 outside I cut a piece of foam plate about 2 inches wider then the Sensor and formed a 45 degree V useing a hair dryer and placed it just above the screw before I placed the Sensor up. That was the only place I saw that might catch water while I had it apart.I have not had a problem out of any of them. I live in S.C. on 2 creek's and the weather is brutal here at times.Wildlife and big falling leaves do set them off but to me that is expected.I use just 2 of the Receivers about 70 ft. apart and at times both don't go off, Which is a good thing, But one or the other always goes off if someone breaks the beam. Day time they pick up father then at night and it depends on where you put them, I have one spot I tried 3 Sensors at, Because it picks up over 100 ft. lolThey change with the weather which I would say is normal.My biggest worry was having to buy batteries, But I went 3 months before having to replace the sensor batteries { 9 volt } Which I think is great, But as with all batteries I purchased rechargeable ones on sale from Amazon because now I can't see doing without my Sensors. You can tell when they are starting to get weak because they don't pick up as well.As far as the Recivers, One I have never had to change the batteries in yet, But I do turn it off on most days and the other one, lol { Not Recommand } I had a 120 volt AC/DC Adapter with output 5 volt, 1 amp as it requires a 4.5 volt output ;) Figured I had 2 more if I burned one up lol Seems to work fine.

I got on Amazon to hunt for a solution and found this item.  It was priced low and had enough decent reviews to make it worth a shot.  In fact I bought two with free Amazon Prime shipping.When it arrived, I found some batteries on the shelf and immediately installed them in each unit and set up for the test.  I put the sensor on the landing halfway up the stairs and the receiver in near my wife's computer, where she usually is when  the little stinker creeps up the stairs.  The next day around 11:00 it went off and she bolted up the stairs and caught him red-pawed.  Oh boy, was he surprised and flew down the stairs.  You know, it's amazing, but you really can go down stairs twice as fast with four legs as you can with two!I had an issue where the alarm was not going off yesterday unless I put the receiver six inches away.  I think that has gone away now with new batteries.Because I'm 100% indoors, I'm not having heat problems.  Because the sensor is on the landing, I don't have issues with it going off constantly.  The chime is somewhere between a digital doorbell and a intruder alert -- not completely annoying, but by no means pleasant.This thing even catches my teens going down the stairs after bedtime, even when they try to jump over it!  Yeah, man!These use one frequency, so the sensor and receiver are identical.  One sensor will set off two receivers, which is a good thing if you don't know what room you'll be in and you have a long ranch or 2-story house.  You can switch off the receiver if you don't want the alarm to go off.  The sensor is always on (Passive Infrared).It's small, cheap, made in China and may not last a year, but it was inexpensive and works for my needs.

It has rubber seal at the seam and battery door and silicone around the lens and LED. It has a black shroud behind the lens to narrow the motion detection range to whats in front and not the immediate sides. Approx 20/35 degree detection angle.For the receiver, I installed a volume knob (50k variable resistor)in series of one of of the speaker wires to mute it or have it set at a comfortably loud volume so it doesn't irritate me as much. Think of those door motion chimes at your local convenience store, that's exactly how the chime sounds like.Other notes: The Driveway Patrol only uses one frequency for the transmitter and receiver, so if you bought two of these, the motion detector will chime both receivers (source: personal experience). I just bought these devices, apologies for not knowing the battery life, but it requires a 9v battery for the motion detector, and 3 \"C\" batteries for the transmitter which can also accept a standard 4.5v ac adapter.

I was on the other end of the house. I ran to my son's bedroom window, which is directly in front of the house, and peeked out.  I saw an older teen boy in front of my daughter's window. He had frozen, must have heard the sensor, too.Well, I wanted to catch him in the act of whatever he was going to do (I thought he wanted to steal from us), so, I ran to the front door.  There is a side window where I can spy on people directly in front of my house, without the people knowing.  Anyway, I thought he was going to break in the window.  Then, I saw him slowly put his hands up on the window sill, and look into my daughter's bedroom (daughter, age 16) to watch her.  That was when I realized that I had a Peeping Tom.I was ENRAGED!  I came flying out of the house, yelled at him. He started  running.  I called the police. Since it was a Peeping Tom offense, they did a thorough investigation, with every legal person imaginable in my yard. They never caught the guy.In return, when I figured out what was \"attracting\" crime on that side of the house, we purchased better curtains, cut down all of the shrubs on that side, and left up the driveway sensor.

They recommended using a birdhouse, but since I did not have one handy, I used an old, plastic soup container. So far, working great. I did cut out a small opening in the plastic where the sensor is and put the plastic top on to protect it from the elements and it still works, even in a heavy rain and now snow.

Reliable, simple, inexpensive, & effective.", "Author": "Brian Newberry \"Say something about yourself!\"", "ReviewID": "R2M3G9ZRX1GZEK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The short end is this: Driveway Patrol Sensor is one of the BEST and least expensive models of its kind.  It is well-manufactured, simple to use, its chime is audible, and the system works reliably. The retail price fluctuates between $ 15 and $30, making this among the least expensive of its kind.As you might guess - this system comes in two parts (each about the size of a mug).  1.  The \"OUTSIDE MOTION SENSOR\" (which actually detects people as they approach)  2.  The \"INSIDE CHIME BOX\" (its chime notifies you with an audible, yet pleasant \"DING-DONG\" sound).Of course the beauty is - these two units can be VERY far apart (400 feet, according to the box).*HOW IT WORKS*Place the \"MOTION SENSOR\" (the smaller unit) near your front door, or anywhere you expect outside people to approach your home (whether friendly, hostile or census takers).Next, you place the other unit (the noise-making \"CHIME BOX\") inside your home.When an outsider approaches the \"SENSOR\" at your front door - you hear the \"CHIME\" inside your bedroom .  Again - the exact locations YOU need may vary.  Instead of your bedroom (or wherever); you might want the CHIME BOX to alert you in your office.***VOLUME CONTROL***The CHIME BOX can be set to \"LOW\" or \"HIGH\" volume, and \"LOW Volume\" is still pretty darn loud.  We set our CHIME BOX to \"LOW\" volume, and put it inside our towel closet NEAR our bedrooom, and close the door.  That way it's loud, but not TOO LOUD, we can still hear it just fine.Each unit has a small hole designed so it can be hung from a nail.  OR - both units are flat at the base, so you can set it on a table or your desk.ADDITIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION:The outdoor \"sensor\" has a small red LED light which illuminates when it detects motion.  I suppose this COULD be a good thing - if you want potential thieves to know they've been detected; perhaps scare them off.  But I personally don't want the outside people to KNOW that they've been detected (suppose I grew up on too much James Bond & Mission Impossible).I cover that little red light with black duct-tape.  Of course I don't cover the MOTION SENSOR itself; just the little red light.In addition to covering the light - I also ensure the CHIME BOX canNOT be heard by anyone outside my apartment.  And then evil intruders (as well as my friendly guests) are UNAWARE THEY HAVE BEEN DETECTED.At first - I was disappointed that the battery cover (on the \"MOTION SENSOR\" unit) requires a PHILLIPS HEAD screwdriver to open.Then another amazon reviewer informed me - many crooks will wait till I leave the house to remove the battery.  That way, once I'm home - they can approach my door without my knowledge (e.g. home invasion robbery).The other unit (the \"RECEIVER / CHIME\" unit) has a simple little thumb latch which opens easily with (appropriately enough) just your thumb!The sensor is extremely sensitive, and can be positioned in different ways to yield different sensivities.  For example - with the architecture around my front door, I find the MOTION SENSOR works better if hanged upside down.  I hung it on a regular  nail & it worked OK.  But then I tried hanging it upside down & it worked even better (I just wrapped a rubberband around it, & hang the rubber band on the nail).  Works like a charm.SUMMARY.Besides being a genuinely good security product, it's fun because my friends think I've got ESP.  BUY THIS!

The sensor and receiver lights still come on but the alarm no longer works making it useless! Mine worked well as a motion alarm until the sound quit. This is not a quality made product. I'm going to try the more expensive one made by another company.I call this motion sensor system a limited good value buy due to its downfalls that despite the low price will be a deal breaker for many people. I'm a gadget guy and I'm budget minded in that I practice money management. I let go of my money at least as hard as it is to get it.To save a penny or two, someone (not \"they\" or the \"company\") decided to broaden acceptable manufacturing specs such that the motion sensor is enough out of round on both ends that a light wind will cause it to rotate and set off the Chimes.To hype sensor sensitivity or save a penny by using the most common off the shelf 180 degree sensor, usefulness is  reduced.I've been experimenting with this unit since I got it to see what exactly I can do with it. People can walk across my driveway on the sidewalk & not activate the chime but a car, SUV.or truck passing by the same way on the street sets it off every time.What many people want is a more focused sensor like mall stores had to compensate for having a wide open door way. More like an light beam straight line that chimes when something passes through. Like it is with hearing aids, the sensor industry has not kept up with the digital revolution. The Chinese have a less MBA notion of profit.

They have good range (50+ feet through several walls) and over a year battery life in both the transmitter/sensor and receiver. The range of the transmitter/sensor can be dramatically extended by following the procedure described below.I use one of the transmitters in my mail box so I know when I have mail. It also alerts me to when the delivery person does not securely shut the door on the mail box.Here is how to extend the range and get the signal out of the metal mail box. First open up the plastic transmitter case by removing the 4 little screws on the back. Locate the white antenna wire that is coiled around the inside of the case and fish it out thorough the weep hole in the bottom of the case. The antenna wire is about 12 inches long when extended. Drill a hole in the bottom/back of the mail box and fish the antenna wire to the outside while placing the transmitter to the rear of the box. Double stick Velcro tape works good for holding the transmitter in place at the rear of the mail box.Update Sep, 2012: 18 months have passed since purchase and both units are still working as good as new. I just replaced the transmitter 9V and the three reciever \"c\" cells. A year and half continious use on one set of batteries is amazing!

Often the drivers would leave stuff on the porch and not ring the bell. After some deliveries disappeared, I wanted to be notified when someone approaches my porch. First, they claim a 400 foot range. It is barely 30 feet. It could not reach my downstairs office so I had to put the alarm portion in the hallway. Okay, not the end of the world. Next, when first set up, it was way too sensitive. It kept going off even when someone passed by on the sidewalk. I put tape along the sides of the sensor, adjusted the position numerous times and eventually found a point where the false alarms were few. The problem is it seems to take a full second or two to register motion. Someone just passing in front of it often doesnt set off the alarm. So I faced it down my walkway where someone would walk straight toward it. That finally worked for about a week. Then, either because of cold weather or the battery becoming weaker, it reached the point where you have to dance two feet in front of it before it would go off.

One thing I learned early on is that you might need to tape off the left and right side of the sensor or it will pick up way too much motion.  I narrowed the window with electrical tape.  Also, tree limbs will set it off if you are not careful about placement.  I learned that putting the transmitter  inside of a quart size zipper bag will prolong the life of the unit and not interfere with the transmission.  This keeps it from getting damp and helps it to last longer.  If the \"low\" chime is too loud inside, wrap it in a towel and you can still hear it fine.  You can also put the receiver in a zip bag and leave it beside the transmitter and it will scare away the bears.  The only reason I am ordering another one is that last night the bear banged into the unit on his way onto the deck and pretty much totaled it.  Placement is important....too low and you get very small animals setting it off, too high and you get things that fly.

I put one of the three receivers in my front window on the inside, out of the rain and another one inside the garage hanging on a previous nail in the wall.  When two chimes go off, I know someone of my family has left the house and is going into the garage.  The mailman never sneaks up on me anymore. People visiting in small Golf carts alert me in the driveway (tree) and when they start down the steps.  By having three of these cheap transmitters I can figure out from what goes off, the person(s) coming to see me even when I am in the back of the house. One caveat though.  Be sure to buy the extra $15 power supply (costs as much as the device, huh?) because the 3 \"C\" batteries do not last a week in use.

Ok i found that the transmitter will not go through glass. So putting it in a jar will not work to protect it from rain sleet heavy fog snow etc. Fog could be worse than rain because it could draw damp inside.  But what i found is that the signal goes through plastic just fine!!!!! I use a clear plastic sandwich bag and tape it shut and it works very good. Now you need to put the bag on like you would put on a car cover (Drape it down over the top) then tape it at the bottom and around the screw. If you use the dollar store clear shiny tape or packing tape it holds very well and you have to tear the bag to change the battery the tape will not come loose. That will protect your transmitters even from blowing rain. I did not test all kinds of plastic but it works even with thick soft plastic. The kind of container lunch meat comes in with the snap on lid. It works to 20 feet or more with baggies to detect movement. I did not test for long distance between transmitter and reciever but if someone does please post the results. Very thin plastic wrap may work even better for distance?  I have had my driveway alerts for 14 months and they are working very good. one other review here said they had one that worked for 5 years. For the price they can't be beat!!! When the transmitter battery gets down to about 6 volts it will start alarming constant because it does not have enough power to reset itself. Alot of people are complaining about birds and deer and dogs and cats setting it off well that is what the sensor should do! It is a PIR sensor that is what it does detect heat. Even the ones that cost much more will still pick up dogs and deer. Unless you get a very pricey one then it may not give as many false alarms.  But as said here in a recent review that if you take some time and point the sensor correct it will greatly reduce the false alarms. It is a good idea to put it in a bird house to hide it and protect it from the rain. I think it is great for security. This could alert you BEFORE someone gets in your house. Then they can not sneek up on you when you are asleep! You will have a advantage because you will be ready for them and you know the house better than they do! And then you can take them OUT!!!!! OH YES YOU CAN!!!!  A burglary happens every 14 seconds in the US. (Google it) I like it because it is 100% wireless and the batterys in the reciever are still working after 14 months! You can also plug it into a 4.5 volt adaptor. I turn it off when away and in the day unless i am expecting someone.

I wish the spread was wider as I use them to cover our entire front yard, but criss-crossing the IR beams works. Also, they sense well beyond 30 feet, so I had to point them downward to avoid alerting on passing cars. I've had two other brands and these work just as well for much less cost.

I gave it some slack for being cheap against needing a lot of fiddling. I first found that just mounted on a post beside the driveway, it was seeing trucks 300 feet away and alarming. Moved it to the other side where it only sees a fence and pasture. Kept false alarming. I figured tall grass blowing in the wind. I used tape to mask off most of the sensor. Still got false alarms. I could get rid of the false alarms, but only by restricting it so much that it couldn't see the car in the driveway. So I used a pvc pipe coupling as a barrel, so I could leave the sensor more open and restrict the angle of view. Seemed to work. But then, on a foggy night, I couldn't see the car anymore. I have put too much time already into it. I'm returning it.I conclude that it does work, in the sense that it can generate an alarm. It may be fine for something like a closed area where anything intruding at all needs to be detected. A back porch, for instance, although the cats will probably set it off.

Once it was mounted in the appropriate area I found that the Cedar Tree effectively shielded most of the signal (limited the range to 100 feet).  To resolve this I simply added about 20 feet of wire beginning near the sensor (a small loop or two) and running around the tree to the area that would give me a line of sight.

As soon as the temperature decreases though, they become much more reliable. I WOULD NOT RECOMENDED THESE DEVICES FOR SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY WITH HOT WEATHER, SUCH AS ARIZONA, TEXAS, NEW MEXICO, ETC. Original review: I am very impressed with this alarm: It is accurately able to detect people coming up the stairs of my apartment, and sets off the indoor alarm -- and it has not sent out any false alarms (Most problems with this alarm (that I have read in the reviews below) appear to be caused by the sensor being in direct sun light. This seems to cause these units numerous difficulties, and should have been addressed in the Patrol Sensor's enclosed instructions -- but isn't. However, by simply shielding the outdoor sensor from all *direct* contact with the light of the sun by using tape or opaque plastic, or repositioning the outdoor sensor, appears to eliminate false alarms or no alarms).

We are not known for our high crime, but we do have our fair share of drug busts and indigents (i.e. homeless people of questionable moral fiber).  I live on an acre, not far from Main Street.  My street does not have street lights or a neighborhood watch program...in short, it is a slightly spooky place to live alone as a middle-aged female (ugh, I hate using that term!).

I installed the Driveway Patrol at my gates, as shown in the tv commercial.  Within 15 minutes of installation,it was ringing regularly to announce the transit of neighboring cats across my property.  Since I do not suspect the cats of having left the hypodermic needles in my yard, this was of little use to me.I readjusted the directionality of the devices, but it still was sensitive enough to pick up pedestrians who were passing by, as well as alerting me to dogs and perhaps birds -- in short, it was going off with \"false\" alarms regularly.  Because there were no other vertical objects along my driveway to hang the devices (and since I really wanted to know if people were coming in through the gates) I was forced to abandon their use.  Additionally, the batteries ran down quickly, most likely due to the continual drain on them caused by transmitting the constant signal to the base unit, which was about 100 feet away inside my house.

Sound is great being pretty loud allowing us to hear it in our basement family room and upstairs. Additionally the dog barks too when she hears it. The unit is about 90 feet away from the house - haven't tried it at a greater distance.  Don't know about battery life yet but the receiver has a jack for external power adapter. No close neighbors so no interference problem for us. UPDATE: It is two years later: The unit above quit functioning after falling out of the tree and I drove over it. Ordered another one and after a few months it experienced the problem others have experienced - would't quit sending signal to the receiver.  Since it was out of warranty I bought a third unit and it has worked now for about a year. I now have 3 receivers that all work with the current transmitter so I can have one on each level of the house. After viewing the construction from the crushed unit I know the sensor is only located in a small area at the top of the \"window\" on the transmitter.

It has a switch on the portable handheld unit, so once you hear he's up, you can turn it off until he's back resting so it doesn't disturb others in the house and keep going off the entire time you're helping him out of the room and back in and 2.  It's much less obvious/annoying to him that you're watching for him to be up so he feels more independent even though he knows that we show up to help him because of it  (because you take the unit that makes noise with you, not in his room)  3. You can take the monitor with you throughout the house, sleep in your own bed, etc and know you'll hear him.  Before that, we seemed to be sleeping on the floor outside his room too often to make sure we heard him get up at night.

I have used several of these units.  They have far too many false alarms caused by the sun going behind the clouds and then coming back out. The units definiely need to be installed out of the direct sunlight. I have made a cone over one of the units that is mounted in the sun and it seems to reduce the amount of false alarms.
