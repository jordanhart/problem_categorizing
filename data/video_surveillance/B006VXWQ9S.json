{"Reviews": [{"Title": "5 star excellent camera but poor documentation", "Author": "Jeffrey Ehrlich", "ReviewID": "R37RMBL8JQPN2Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is excellent.  Well built, great image, terrific IR (at least 100').  Has a lot of features and very impressive for the money.  However, because it is built like a battleship, it is large and heavy.  If you have an application where you want the camera to be small and inconspicuous, buy some other camera. I took off one star because the documentation is poor beyond belief.  There is one sheet and it assumes you know how to use an EFFIO-E camera.  Doesn't mention how to access the onscreen menu (the controller is on the end of the cable pigtail).  Nor is there any explanation for the various parameters that can be set.  The camera seems to have the ability to detect motion but I have no idea how this would be communicated back to the DVR.  Also not mentioned is the focus and zoom controls (which are on the bottom of the camera).  They also provide a small allen wrench, but I have no idea what this would be used for (some internal fine adjustment I would guess.  It's a shame that such a beautiful camera has such poor documentation.  The importer of this camera should have taken ten minutes to add their own cheat sheet for their margin.  I blame the importer, not the manufacturer (the Chinese, I have found, do not understand the need for detail documentation and are somewhat embarrassed by their English skills.  They shouldn't be.  They can write English a lot better than I can write Chinese!) In any case, I plan to buy one or two more.  I would ignore the negative review.  It's completely off base.  I have three degrees in electrical engineering and I know a good piece of equipment when I see one.", "Date": "October 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Barry Fonseca", "ReviewID": "R3RVQXC1P9A8X4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I needed a camera to replace our webcam over looking Newport Harbor.

Solid case construction but larger than similar outdoor cameras. Bought two units, one would not switch properly to night vision and was returned for refund.

BUT, I don't care because far and away this is the best camera I've used to date. Night vision is outstanding - I don't know about the 164' claim but it's damn good. Both day and night clarity is great. I bought this $90 unit to replace an older $300 unit which finally quit on me but there is just no comparison between the two - the new unit blows away my old one. I may have to try and dial down the IR (if I can) as it's so bright I might end up burning a hole in my neighbors lawn. LOL", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's a great camera", "Author": "T.
