So there is some glitch in this device and it seems Panny is not doing a firmware often enough or at all for this device. I returned it and Amazon was great with taking it back as is there M.O., I can not recommend this device as it is, if they come up with a firmware that corrects the issue maybe but not now.As far as image quality, it was fine, nothing to get excited about. Night and low light where horrible, you couldn't make out a chair it was so bad, but with good light it was fine. For what I paid for it via the Gold Box special it was good enough.  I think I am going to give the Foscom cameras a try next.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Panasonic BL-VP104WP 720p ip Camera", "Author": "tomg", "ReviewID": "R36GURM00BQBPE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been changing my camera system over from the older Panasonic IP cameras (like the BB-HCM511, BL-C210, etc VGA) to the new VP104 and VT164...they both have wireless versions. They all seem to use the same firmware/software. First, they can't be set up or viewed \"out of the box\" on anything but a Windows based computer w/IE. However, they are compatible with equipment (like NVRs) that are \"Onvif\" compatible. This means that they run on VioStor and many of the inexpensive NVRs coming out of China (at least the ones I have used).The 104 does not have a mic, speaker, any hardware alarm inputs, or the heat sensor alarm of the VT164. However, it does have motion detection and comes with a mounting bracket that mounts to the back. All these camera put out very good video if there is enough light...don't expect as good a picture as the older models in low light applications...very noisy in low light. They can output 4:3 or wide screen. Lots of setup features and options...however, no timer to trigger ftp for those wanting to upload a still image every few minutes to a server. I like the camera interface, but it is completely different from the older UI...if you like the old one, it will take some time to get used to this one.5 stars because of the price and great picture with enough light...hard to match it with another brand and get 720p!", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008SHK6KG"}}
