I installed a 1TB hard drive and the total cost for the 4 camera system came in at under $200. Works well with windows but does not work on my Android phone. I use Log-Me-In to view on my phone and it works great.Good product at a good price.I give it 4 stars", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Product!!!", "Author": "CG", "ReviewID": "RI6130KGBNBKX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to setup.

It would black out and reset itself and not keep the time. It was a great system as far as features and the software and the programming it had. Just wish it had worked. So I bought this system thinking its another cheap system same things going to happen with in a few weeks. But now I have had it about two months and am really liking it. It works well and is stable! (At least the TV's remote did not interfere with it! Last one any remote would cause it to mess up.) It has good quality and is good with play back. So far a good cheap system go ahead and pick this or another by Zmodo. It does have internet viewing but only for one person at a time my other box had multiple users/viewer and logs and more. Good motion detection is better than what I was dealing with the last box. Multi-View for all channels is good to! Searching for videos works but not as good as the box I had before. It could use some upgrading but works fine. Set was really easy, install cams than connect to box and their all video started to work. If not real easy to figure out the setting any how! So now I feel comfortable and at peace with this system running (already caught some things I wanted to!!!)", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$139.50", "Features": "View Video Online with No Service Fees - View your DVR's live or recorded video footage on any PC.\nLong time recording: - Base on the H.264 Compression, maximize the hard drive's recording time, as well as transfer video for viewing over the internet.\nNetwork Remote Access - Access live video footage directly from your mobile phone or PC anytime anywhere\nAdvanced Motion Detection Recording - This allows you record only when motion is detected.\nInstant Email Alerts if Activity Detected - This system is designed to send an email alert, complete with photo of the activity, if any motion is detected, or if any camera experiences video loss.", "Name": "Zmodo 8CH H.264 Complete Security System CCTV Surveillance Camera System With 4 Night Vision IR Surveillance Camera No Hard Drive", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51r6LYa4jVL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00AARIUJQ"}}
