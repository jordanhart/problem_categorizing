{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It's really great for the price", "Author": "LUKE S.", "ReviewID": "RA8FWSYPBW4G8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the 60$ premium, I personally think that you're buying a great product.Day or Night, the image quality is very good. During the day I personally think that the colors are replicated quite well. The color scheme seems to be natural; if you're looking for vibrant, you're going to have to spend 3 or 4 times more, although I haven't played around with the image settings on these, this is just straight out of the box. During the night, you'll get fantastic image quality from 0-30 feet, very good 31-40 feet, and good 41-50 feet; anything past that is not great at all but it is advertised up to 50 feet.Overall, I have these cameras paired up with Night Owl's 4 channel system and I am more than pleased with the setup. After all of the research conducted, it's the best bang for the dollar spent for a residential or small business setting that I could find.Hopefully this helps with your purchasing decision", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EDTQGL6"}}
