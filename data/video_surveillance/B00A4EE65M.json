This system is easy to use, cameras are high quality with video that is very clear.  There is no question that the recordings of this system would be VERY valuable in indentifing people that may be outside my home.  Love the access via smart phone form any location.  Would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a solid security system.", "Date": "March 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$99.99", "Features": "65ft security camera extension cables\nConnects any Defender security cameras to security systems with BNC connections.\n1 year manufacturer's direct warranty\nThis bundle includes 4 surveillance camera extension cables", "Name": "Defender 65ft Security Camera Extension Cable (21007) - 4 Cables Included", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fajqEWZAL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00A4EE65M"}}
