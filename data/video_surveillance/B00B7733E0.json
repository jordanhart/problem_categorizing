In order to do a lot of the set-up, you really need to have the thing hooked to your computer. It took me seemingly forever to figure out what I needed to do to set it up so that it'd catch motion to record my cats day and night. Even once you have the right software on your computer, it's not particularly intuitive.That said, the sucker works! I wish it held its charge better between uses, but overall, it did exactly what I needed it to. We have four cats. One started peeing outside the box. No matter how hard I tried, I could never catch any of them in the act. Knowing that could mean a health issue (and getting seriously ticked off about cleaning up pee four times a day), I needed to know who it was. This spy cam was the most affordable and the most appropriate to my needs.-It doesn't need to be hooked up to a computer to capture images.-It works on an internal, rechargeable battery OR plugged into a wall.-It has a motion sensor (so it doesn't needlessly drain the battery recording a blank wall)-It has a night mode for low-light environments (like small areas being lit by a night light)-It has a long enough charge time to record for hours.-It's small, so easily concealed (my cats are typical cats: insatiably curious, so this was a MUST).I finally caught the cat in question and was able to get her to the vet to figure out what was going on. She had multiple medical issues. Now I use it when I expect unsupervised visitors to our apartment.", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little camera!", "Author": "Jennifer Cartelli", "ReviewID": "R3G3FBZ2NY34MP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this to try and catch the person who was coming into our office while we weren't there.

This thing is great! All you have to do is download the widget, plug it into your computer via the usb cable that they supply, and you're in business. You configure it in a lot of differnt setting. Vibration, motion dectector. You can configure it to go on when the car starts and off when the car stops, or you can do the opposite and configure it to go on when the car stops and off when it starts. YOu do all those things in custom mode. there's also on the go mode and some other mode I can't remember. I don't know what on the go mode means.The picure quality is very good, if you ask me. I have it on the lowest resolution and it looks good. I don't think the angle is very wide though.The guide that comes with it is in english as in real english not some horrible translation. The site has a lot of information including the guide, videos taken by the device, FAQ, a support phone number and a email address. They're not hiding and let you know that there is no overseas office so you have to call the hong kong number or email them.I'm very glad I purchased this. I haven't used it but I've tested it. I have it set up for motion detection. when you turn on the device it starts to record for 10 seconds, then it stops. When it detects motion it starts and you can set it to record for 10, 15 or 30? minutes. after that time if there is no more motion it stops recording. You can set the sensitivity for motion detection and vibration trigger or voice trigger. it has a time date stamp and too. There's a firmware update for use on a MAC  i think.

Most cameras I've found were too big, too expensive, and/or couldn't store memory. I've tried \"spy pens\" and was sorely disappointed. This little guy here is incredible! It is almost as big as a credit card, but side with the camera lens is only 1.7 x 0.8 inches, so it's easy to hide in various places. The instructions were easy to follow. Mine came with a charger cord for the wall and the car and a USB cord for the PC. To set it up I simply had to connect the camcorder to my PC, download the widget from the website, choose my settings, and press a button to sync everything. I'm literally shocked that I haven't had any issues with it so far. I did a few test runs to see how large the camera angle is and how well it adjusts to light changes. Again, I couldn't be more impressed. You can set it up to start recording when it senses motion, voice, or vibration (or all three). It also has a night/day mode, or you can have it adjust to changes automatically (which, like I said, worked rather well). You can even set it to record right-side-up or upside-down! These are just a few of the main features that I found really useful. I don't intend to use it in the car, so I don't know how well that part works. The video quality is decent for surveillance and you can adjust the quality to save space. It also has audio.Pros:-Very small and discrete, not obvious that this is a camera just by looking at it-VERY simple and easy set up!!-Decent video/audio quality-Numerous recording options to choose fromCons:None so far!I would definitely recommend this to others!

In low lighting, you would definitely be able to recognize someone you know. In very low lighting it's just a dark screen with lines.Cons- As for what I purchased it for its kind of a pain. I was hoping to just catch bits of video when anyone enters the room, which is what I programmed it to do. But it almost constantly records no matter what. Or when it isn't constantly recording it seems to record pretty randomly. In order to keep a good eye on the room I would need to go through hours of footage of an empty room and wait to see if someone comes in.

Lots of programmable options (some work well)One thing I do love is its small footprint and the fact it doesn\u2019t look like it is a dash cam.  In fact its quite stealth in any application,  With all flat surfaces it\u2019s a snap o mount using Velcro,  I also like its output pix are in AVI.  Quality by day is very good.  No video display or unnecessary video outputs. but its not like I miss them\u2026Pretty much it captures what is in front of it.  A smarter design would put the on/record light on the driver\u2019s side of the unit.  However with a little trial and error its predictable and easy to use.  A half hour of continuous video (with sound) uses about 900 megs. .  After an overnight test on battery I found  the unit was still recording in the morning.Some have reported problems with Zetta software but  I like its widget that worked well for me.  Its on line instructions are easy to find in PDF and seem to be written by an \u201cEnglish speaking person\u201d (they are at least easy to read).  Without any programming it works out of the box in 2 basic modes.  Once programmed its way more versatile.For me this is about as close to what I want as I may find\u2026  Lots of uses for a camera like this, both stealth and general monitoring \u2026 I already ordered a second unit and stole the largest SD cards from other dash cams that were so  klunky I never used them.Last thing\u2026 night and low light operation  \u2026 Very important and a little strange with this camera.  It works well at night in headlight or limited streetlight light., it even picks up some infer red light \u201cBUT\u201d the auto light level setting gets confused, sometimes it  \u201cblooms\u201d, more often you see lines/streaks degrading the pix quality.

This unit even came with scratches on the plastic casing. I did test the video just in case but this is not viable for the low light recording I need and the daytime video was worse on this unit then the last 2.Again I really like the features and size but it looks like the quality control is non-existentAfter 3 units I will not be getting/using this for my needs.", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great vallue", "Author": "Disappointed", "ReviewID": "R3CAAMJ0SGXK99", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a good little surveillance camera for the money. Doesn't do very well in low light, but then again it's not inferred capable and the speakers aren't the greatest at a distance but they work well  you're not too far away, I also did not like that the software for this product shows as security risk. However, the camera itself works quite well. The picture was clear (as long as you didn't try to record over other frames) and if the camera was within a short distance it also picked up voice pretty good. Overall the camera serves it's purpose and works pretty well for the price. The biggest drawback is not being able to watch it live, but I knew that when I ordered it. the second biggest drawback is the software (not sure if it's safe or not).", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "a true spy tool", "Author": "abc_warbot", "ReviewID": "R9B1B6STMZEJM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Price, and uses, can be used in a car, or on its own battery.

Microphone is just ok.  Recording file sizes are very large so I would recommend buying a 32gb Micro SDHC High Speed Class 4 card B004G7D0EG  in addition.  My last recording was approx 9 hours and took up over 8gb memory.  On a tangent, if you are also interested in a good audio only device I have been very impressed with the \"MEMOQ\" MQ-77N ink pen I recently purchased. Instructions were in poor english but after you get through the setup it's very easy to use and records well. Totally inconspicuous with extremely small mic hole and it writes.
