I usually have someone come in to help me with setup because, least ways in my case, something is difficult to manage.  For example, the factory set IP may not be compatible with your local network.  In this case you'll be needing some assistance, but this issue can be worked through.At this point in time, GigaEye is new to the market and their website is still under construction, including the user manual that the security camera neophyte would need to access.  Anyone else who has set this type of camera up before may well be familiar with this type of issue and won't have problems.  Others who are inexperienced may wish to take a pass ... for now.Competitively, this camera has a price point considerably lower than most on the market. The quick start guide is quite clear and gives instructions as to Wi-Fi connection setup, remote access setup, references concerning port forwarding, getting a WLAN IP address, hardware installation, and wired access for first time use.  The camera works as it claims, but due to the lack of support at this time, I need to subtract a star from my rating.WHAT'S IN THE BOX:\u25ba  GigaEye Gb170 Outdoor IP Camera\u25ba  Software CD\u25ba  Power Adapter\u25ba  Plastic Stand\u25ba  Ethernet Cable\u25ba  Mounting Bracket & ScrewsFEATURES:\u263c  Waterproof\u263c  Motion Detection with Email/FTP Alarm\u263c  Remote Access\u263c  Night Vision\u263c  IR Cut Filter\u263c  WiFi Connection\u263c  iPhone/Android CompatibleSPECS:\u25ba  Model:  GigaEye GB170\u25ba  Image Sensor:  CMOS Sensor\u25ba  Display Resolution:  640*480\u25ba  Lens:  4mm (IR Lens)\u25ba  Viewing Angle:  60\u00b0\u25ba  Image Compression:  MJPEG\u25ba  Audio:  Not Supported\u25ba  Pan/Tilt Angle:  None\u25ba  Infrared Lights:  36 IR LEDS, Night Vision up to 25 meters\u25ba  Storage Temperature: -10\u00b0C ~ 60\u00b0 (14\u00b0F ~ 140\u00b0)\u25ba  Storage Humidity:  0\u00b0 ~ 90% non-condensing\u25ba  Supported OS:  Microsoft Windows 2000/XP, Vista, Windows 7, Mac OS, Linux\u25ba  Browser:  IE6/IE7/IE8/IE9/Firefox/Safari/Chrome and other standard browsers\u25ba  Certifications:  CE, FCC\u25ba  Warranty:  2 year, limitedSample provided for review.", "Date": "October 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "First Impressions", "Author": "nosebreaker", "ReviewID": "R26KQ9O43JGS0Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just installed this, and being familiar with IP cameras I had no problems getting it to work.  I hardwired the ethernet as well as power, I did not want to risk interference with wireless.The software seems to be from the GB150, I would surmise they took a 150 and put it in a weatherproof case.  The motion detection email alarm worked perfectly, it sends a few pictures attached to the email when it detects motion.  The night vision is pretty good also, you can see a little bit of red in the LEDs at night.The downside is that the field of vision is very narrow.  I bought this thinking I could cover my driveway, but even at 25ft away it barely covers more than my door and half a parking spot.  I'll be getting a different camera that can cover the entire area.

For the price I paid for this camera, it's totally a steal.The build of this camera is very solid. I've seen so many cheap cameras, most of them are like plastic toys. This camera is totally different, it weights quite heavy, the metal is quite thick and make me feel confident about having this outdoor.Installation is easy, three screws and you are done (sadly you still need to wire power cord for an outdoor camera). The setup is easy too, software is quite intuitive and takes less than 5 minutes. I can use my phone or PC to watch live feed of the camera from anywhere. The image quality is way better than other cameras. Even though the resolutions are the same, somehow this camera's image is sharper as I compare it side to side to another brand.The camera is reliable, no question at all. I set up the camera to upload image every minute, any missing image will trigger an alarm. The camera has been running none stop for over a week and not a single upload missed.Last but not least, the price is not beatable by any other camera.

Also, I have been attracted by the fact that its description suggests that this camera can be easily mounted anywhere.And so it was!

But its features are the ones that will amaze anybody: you have 36 infrared LEDs which seriously improve the image quality in difficult conditions. Then, you are provided with the capability to place it anywhere you want, as long as your WIFI router is covering the area with sufficient signal.
