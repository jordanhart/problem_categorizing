{"Reviews": [{"Title": "great quality with a few quirks", "Author": "LoveMama02", "ReviewID": "RC0LZ5TKJ103X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sound and view quality is fantastic!  However, when you have two cameras set up to the same monitor the sound becomes an issue.  If you are trying to view more than one at a time (you can view up to four), there is no sound at all.  Also, there is a mode that cycles through all cameras, spending a few seconds on each.  This works great unless you have it on \"power save\" mode.  In this mode, the screen shuts off after a few minutes of inactivity (which is nice for night time); however, as soon as the screen cuts off, the sound stops cycling and you can only hear the sound from the camera that was on display when the screen cut off.  I have to leave the screen on all night long to be able to hear both my girls, which is a little annoying considering how bright the screen is when it's on.", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00C2MBR2O"}}
