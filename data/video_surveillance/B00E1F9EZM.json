Merlo", "ReviewID": "R15MFT8Z0KNE5A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "for the price this is a very good deal. installed camera quickly. adjustments could be easier for pointing but just takes a little more effort. video quality good and bold, and night vision very good. automatically adjusts for items close by not washing out those at a distance. audio works well too. have issues with my DVR software recording audio, may be user error, but mic works well, not cameras fault. admittedly there weren't many choices for a camera in this range with audio, but it worked out well. if i need another i would buy it again. easily 5 stars for performance at this price.", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good for the money", "Author": "Capt512", "ReviewID": "R11BZE90D1BRZ5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I went through several of these before getting four good ones to go around my house. I don't think quality control is the greatest but customer service from Beach Audio where I got mine was excellent and they exchanged bad ones for good ones with little hassle. Audio as well as day and night vision is excellent.Only real complaint I have is that the cable coming out of the camera is pretty short so if your running the cable through a wall or like me trying to hide it behind siding etc. it can be a pain.This are hard to find now so if your looking for a fairly inexpensive audio / video camera I would probably recommend this one IF your able to get it from someone who offers a refund or exchange program.", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Survelliance", "Author": "Carolyn J.
