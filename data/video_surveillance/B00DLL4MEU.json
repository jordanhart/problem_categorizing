I have not used the optional computer software and have not played back any footage yet.Installation is relatively simple. Drill holes in your house, run wire from attic to holes , run wire from attic to the DVR. Make sure you have an outlet in your attic. My house is not huge but the included cable was not sufficient to place the cameras around the house, even though we did not place any on the two farthest corners. Keep in mind the cable is not stocked most places so you might want to go ahead and order extra when you order the system. In our case we only needed about 20 feet but had to buy 60 extra feet of a different brand cord because that was all that was locally available.The picture is great for the price. Use common sense when placing the cameras. Don't aim the camera into direct sunlight. The night vision is not reliable but you would be able to make out a person. So far, I'm happy with the investment.", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "Freeheel", "ReviewID": "R2K0J6MZVCGLAL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got into this from not having any experience with security monitoring systems and I am good with computers but not a computer wiz.  The first one that came had a defective hard drive so I sent it back and got another.  It's rather easy to set up as far as making all the connections.  After that I had to contact support to get the soft ware set up.  The folks at support are very knowledgeable and courteous. They were very helpful.  Because my router is in a different part of the house than the DVR, I had to purchase an adapter from net gear for $50 so that the DVR could connect wirelessly with the router.  That seems to be working fine.  There are several settings for clarity so I called support back and they helped me dial that in.  To me the clarity is acceptable but not like watching an HD show on your TV.  It is affected by things like the sun and location.  A cool function is that you can set the sensitivity of the motion control so that it doesn't turn the camera on record  when things like rain drops fall past the camera.  You can even adjust the sensitivity in a portion of the view such as eliminating the foliage of a tree so if the wind blows and the tree moves , it won\"t trigger the camera to record.  Once I got the whole thing set up, I found it also useful to see what's going on in my driveway while I'm at my computer, without having to get up and go to a window.  I'm going to set up a monitor in my wood shop in my basement so when the dog starts barking I can see if someone drove in or if he just saw a deer.  Speaking of deer, the cameras are handy picking up wild life.  I got the cameras because I live in a rural area and had some tools stolen from my barn.  More than anything I was hoping they would act as a deterrent.Now for the 4 star rating.  My mobile device of choice is an iPad.  You can only view from a mobile device in real time.  It is also at a setting that is of poor clarity and that can't be changed.  You can not review recorded images from a remote device.  The other thing I didn't like was the signage enclosed.  The stickers are of poor quality.  They stick fine to glass but not to metal.  I was also hoping that at least one larger sign was included but you have to pay extra for that.  All in all I am satisfied with it for the price and would recommend it to a friend, but I would explain it's short comings.  Hope that wasn't too much information.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very friendly to use, and easy to install it yourself (intermediate computer user level)", "Author": "Gustavo Rodriguez \"Camera photography student\"", "ReviewID": "R2L63LLW8E6KQX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This surveillance system has given me a piece of mind big time, not only as many other do such as offering the images over the internet, but because I can access to the actual system and to whatever I can do if I was physically onsite.

The video quality is PHENOMENAL!!!  Crystal clear.  And at night the cameras do magic.  When you see them at night you think it's daylight that's how bright everything is.  The video quality over internet via swannviewpro isn't great because the DR does not count with fast internet connection.  Well, they have it but it is EXTREMELY pricy!  I have a 2mbp plan which is what most homes have.  Maybe if I had a faster connection video quality would be better.

As a techie I messed around with this thing trying to get it to show up on my phone for a week before breaking down and calling Swann.  They remote accessed my computer and set the whole thing up in 20 minutes.  Amazing.  The product itself is wonderful.  Picture quality is clear and running the wires no problem.  I had to buy a couple 100' wires because depending on where you set this up, the included wires may be too short.  I have the DVR set up next to my router which is next to the tv, so anytime I want to check the cameras I can switch the input on the tv and be right there.  The motion feature is nice and the interface is self explanatory.

This is the second unit from Swann we have installed.  I found support very helpful.  I thought I had a problem with one unit and they me an RMA number to send it back for replacement but the problem cleared up. One of the cameras may have a problem and I have it covered by the RMA as well.  The cameras are not vary high resolution but good enough for surveillance.  Three of the cameras are wide angle at 75+ degrees which are working very well and have excellent coverage for the gym area.", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Quality..", "Author": "abelardo trevino", "ReviewID": "RMEEDIITR2D6S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good stuff!!

Shortly after Swann released a whole new product line.  Now that I upgraded to Windows 7 my system is basically non functional.  I will say I had no product complaints when my system was running on older windows platform.  I spent over 3 hours between on hold, and  Swann tech support to no avail, and Swann sales wouldnt offer so much as a discount on new product.  Swann advertises \"lifetime support\" which is obviously not the case!  I am not going to invest anymore money into Swann products because who knows if it will work properly with next generation windows pc's?

Micek \"rookie woodworker\"", "ReviewID": "R3O9Q4CKXI7U4Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First of all: save any receipt of purchase you may have. You'll need it. If Swann equipment breaks, it seems like this company will do nothing for you without your proof of purchase. In plain English, you're screwed without your sales receipt and your RMA number. The seller will give you a sales receipt. Keep it and make copies of it. Don't ever give Swann the original. Swann will give you an RMA number when you call for help. The RMA number is something like a traffic ticket number. Don't ever lose it. Swann will treat you like a criminal if you lose either number. You will be totally screwed if you lose either number. Always have your RMA number and proof of purchase anytime you call them.Lucky for me, I had my receipt, but that introduces the second problem: wildly uneven customer service and support. You may call for help and you might be put on hold forever. You might get some guy from the Phillipine Islands who doesn't speak English very well. Example, your service agent may think \"Jan\" and \"Feb\" are names not abbreviations for the months of the year. You might also get a fluent English speaker. It is a total crap shoot. Two things are for sure: 1) you will never get the same agent twice, and 2) you will need to give each new agent the same information all over again, and over and over until you are ready to explode. It is like they are looking for an excuse to dismiss you.That much said, let's say that like me, you saved your receipt and you were smart enough to use \"chat\" instead of trying to communicate with someone who speaks pidgeon Engllish, or the \"tag-a-long\" dialect, you're still screwed because many of these people seem pleasant and sincere, but their language skills are frequently on the \"Me Tarzan; you Jane\" level. \"Me paying customer; You service rep.\" They have a script, they know only the words on the script, if they get off script, they don't know what you are saying. Their phony English will leave you screaming because they can't understand phrases like, \"Contact the American repair center. Tell them I already sent them the RMA number and the sales receipt. Use e-mail to inform them I sent my documentation to the fax number they gave me.\" It's like talking to your dog.Here is my reality. I actually faxed my receipt and my RMA number to their warehouse location two times. That cost me $8.00 US. They misplaced my paperwork two times. How? One time their fax machine ran out of paper and they didn't know it. Another time they sent their half-wit warehouse man to the wrong fax machine. That's what's wrong with Swann. Their left hand doesn't know what their right hand is doing. Their repair shop is now threatening to send my broken machine back to me because they think I have failed to send them a copy of the sales receipt and the RMA number. I actually became so frustrated that I faxed them a copy of my successful transmission slip. Get this: their customer service computer shows that they have received copies of both transmissions! The two groups don't seem to \"communicate with each other\". Worse, customer service has an \"Eeet  is not my yob\" attitude to communicating with the repair personnel This experience is like something out of an old Charlie Chaplin movie.When you talk to customer service, expect long delays or gaps in conversation. Expect them to \"screw up\". on the phone and on the fax and on the computer. You will probably also lose patience with these people. I sure did.These people are not unfriendly and they do try; it is just that they are stymied by a lack of English fluency and frustrated by awful pronunciation. Example: \" Beer in the Pillapeens.\" is actually \"We're in the Phillipines.\": Worse, the transatlantic phone lines to the Phillipines can be upset by storms. As I wrote before, the most insane part of this whole experience is that you might accidently get a rep who speaks good English and is knowledgable. The contrast between \"Beer in the Pill and We're in the Phillipines\" makes the experience surrealistic. Of course, as I wrote, you'll get a different person each time. Each rep will have a different language skill level. Each will ask you to start over from the beginning. They will make you feel like you have stolen the machine. Asking for the sales receipt and the RMA number over and over made me feel like I was trying to bamboozle them into giving you a new, working piece of equipment. They have a police station mentality.I'll bet these incompetents will send my broken DVR back to me without repairing it because they can't find the information I faxed to them. Bottom Line: don't use Swann. The customer service experience with them is nearly abusive in nature. You could end up screaming, cursing and pulling your hair out. Their stuff breaks. Their customer service is inadequate. Their repair techs are inept.
