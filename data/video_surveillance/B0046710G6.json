It is not hard to set up. You plug in its AC adapter and plug it into your router. Follow the instructions and wow.The picture is wonderful. The motion alarm is fantastic. We placed on of these inside our barn across the street from our home, about 350 feet away. We added an $80. antenna to our router from Hawking, also available on Amazon, and poof! I can now see what all the sqwak is at 2AM in my barn with out walking all the way out there! Wow, wow, wow. The pan and tilt features are really nice. We setup another at our front door, and three \"out door\" styles around the outside of the property. I don't know how long this black \"indoor\" will last in the extreme temps and humitity of our barn and front porch, but that is not Foscam's problem. I will update at the end of the winter, or sooner if they die during winter!4/3/11 Well they made it through the winter. We have been able to review motion detection alarm triggered video clips that were saved on our pc. We have been able to remote pan across the barn to see who is making all the racket and why. It is lovely to know who has been on your porch while you were sleeping! The cameras are wonderful. the there is an antenna you can get on amazon that will extend you wireless cababilities. We view the inside and outside of our barn across the street. These are great.", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Way more than I expected!", "Author": "Corey Perez", "ReviewID": "R2T4HZM73OE7RJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Where to start...Well I'll open with..  I'm IMPRESSED!  I opted to get the white version of the FI8918W just because it was cheaper than the black version and was identical other than the color.  I was first concerned because I got two camera's and the first one was \"loose\" it seemed (camera from the base).  The second seems to be identical so this must just be the way these camera's are.  I hooked this up directly to my router as per the instructions and tried to determine a standard ip address without having to use the included software.  I wasn't able to so then used the mini-disc on my windows 7 PC.  The computer prompted for reboot which I did before I noticed the icon on the desktop.  When it rebooted I double clicked the icon and after a brief moment it displayed the ip address of the camera.  Note:  I'm also using zone alarm and it requested access to 255.255.255.255:10000, which I allowed and it displayed the camera.When I double clicked the ip address displayed in the software window I was taken to ie which then I put in the user id: admin and  for the PW.  I don't know if I'm just lucky because I've had so many lessons with my other IP cameras, but this one was very easy (outside trying to figure out why the wireless config wasn't working as expected).  One of the other things I was really impressed with was the ease of setting up the wireless.  I \"scanned\" for wireless sources, found mine, clicked it and nearly all the fields were prefilled.  I only had to input my security key.  Now... The issue I had.  I'm currently running 4 different cameras, x2 different Linksys camera's and a trendnet.  Those all when setup kept their ip address.  This Foscam uses a different one.  So after you have it setup I'd recommend re-running their ip software and finding the new ip address after you have removed the cat5 cable.  This took me about an hour to figure out.My camera background:I started out with x2 Linksys wvc54gca.  These were my basis for learning about the IP camera's, the router work required to open the ports and more especially multiple camera's on the same router and how to accomplish that.  After moving from the lower 48 to Alaska, we wanted a pan tilt zoom (PTZ) camera and opted for the Linksys WVC210.  This camera is a very nice unit, but after getting the new Foscam night PTZ camera, I feel like I wasted a significant amount of money on this one unit, when I believe the Foscam FI8918W is easily a better buy.  We also have the Trendnet tv-ip422w and compared to this new Foscam camera, the video is absolutely SUBPAR to the Foscam.While this is a review about the Foscam FI8918W I want the readers to know and appreciate what this camera does.  The Linksys WVC54GCA works perfectly in IE and Firefox (Safari as well).  The WVC210 will NOT, repeat NOT work with IE.  There is an active X that is required and Cisco must have an issue with Microsoft or something because I cannot force my computer to accept the active X.  You can ONLY view this in Fire Fox (FF) or Safari (if I remember correctly), but FF is what we use to view it.  These Foscam's work in: IE8, FF and FF on Mac OS-X (Snow Leopard).  I haven't tried Safari, but our needs were met in that realm.Mobile browsing:  Both of the Linksys cam's were visible on our iPhone/iTouch.  We have now ditched the iPhone (junk) and went with the Samsung captivate (android) and had the same experience.  The Trendnet and Foscam units were not viewable on either of our phones.  This was an initial HUGE issue, but I've found that on both the itunes and android app store there is an app (android has a free version, apple doesn't) called \"IP Cam Viewer\" by Robert Chou (android lite version works for free and has a banner at the top).  If you use this program use \"Add IP\" in the settings to add your DNS address you established and go from there.  This app also allows \"swipe to pan\" option.. NICE!!In setting up, I mentioned that I have multiple camera's.  I've resorted to using multiple different port's such as: myipcam,dot,com:1111 and the next is: myipcam,dot,com:1112, and:  myipcam,dot,com:1113, etc.  You will establish this in your individual camera settings and your router config.Over all.I know my setup was based on historical config's I've done with other camera's so I was aware of some of the pitfalls.  But I believe these cameras were the easiest to setup.  The camera's software/firmware is a little \"hokey\" and could be improved I believe, but It has everything it needs to have (that I could determine) so I can't fault the firmware (admin) settings/options about that.  The actual web GUI (interface) was pretty nice, especially compared to the other camera's I have.  I didn't try the multiple setup and accessing them through the internet because one of the two cameras we received will be kept a little more \"private\" and may have access to part of our bedroom from its location.The camera is very quiet.  I found myself enjoying that with the movement options you can hold down the arrow (on the screen) and the camera will move until you unclick it.The status LED, which can be turned off, is located on the back.  I appreciate that as well.The only thing I found a little annoying was the IR bulbs are a little too visible.  We have one of these in the kids' bedroom and the red glow (obvious) always attracts attention.  This is visible even when the IR is turned \"off\" in the settings.The package included everything I believe a normal user would require/desire.  Camera, base (movable/adjustable which is a nice touch), antenna, screws and anchor, cat5 cable and the power cord.On the audio, I didn't try/use the included option.  I'm sorry that a review of that feature cannot be included.  With the amount of camera's we are running we can't support the additional bandwith requirements.The only problem I experienced was the wireless being a different IP address vs. the wired IP address.  I've never experienced this before, but was a simple fix by using the supplied software.In closing:I wish I could provide a link so others could see how impressive these CAM's are.  But I won't ;)  Had I known how great a value these cameras would be I would have purchased at least a couple more, with the possibility of enough to replace / supplement all of our Linksys/Trendnet cam's.  I'm leaving for a yearlong military deployment in 10 days so the ease in setup/config was a HUGE help and success on the part of this company.  At this point I'd have no issue recommending these to anybody who is looking for an excellent camera.  The day time image is excellent, the night vision (as with everything) is less grand, but the IR bulbs completely illuminate our 12x35' room with plenty of light to spare.  These camera's are all usable on Win XP (laptop), Win Vista (laptop), Win 7 (PC) (Both with IE 8 and Fire Fox) and Mac OS-X (Snow Leopard) on a Macbook Pro and IMac , ipod Touch and Samsung Captivate (Android) WHEN using the app: ipcam viewer by Robert Chou (free on Android).I really hope this review helps some other potential buyers as I had a ton of questions, to which few (if any) were answered by other reviews.", "Date": "January 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Unbelievable performance for the price", "Author": "John Colby", "ReviewID": "R37M39M735X7MW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are a ton of well-written reviews for this camera (also check out the other versions, e.g. FI8918W White, FI8905W) that give an excellent sense of its many strengths, minor weaknesses, as well as  tips for setting up IP cameras in general. I won't rehash the basics, but I will give a brief overview of my setup. Then I'll make a comment on security, and finally go through some of the ways you can extend this camera's capabilities. This last section is where the Foscam truly shines, in my opinion. After all, if I just wanted a no-hassle cam/DVR, I could get something more basic (but much more expensive) off the shelf at Costco or through a residential security company.If you have any questions, just comment on this review. I'm happy to respond.Setup:The setup process was very standard for any sort of web-enabled device. It'll take a bit longer if you've never gone through the steps before, but once you do it, you'll know how to set up a whole slew of similar devices (e.g. home webserver, media servers, etc.). There are literally hundreds of great tutorials on all of these topics around the web, so if any step or terminology is confusing, just google it and you'll find a bunch of good links. (i.e. don't get deterred by reviews that say \"bad instruction manual\" or \"bad customer service\", since you won't need either if you have the whole internet and the power of google at your fingertips). Anyway, here is the rough outline of the setup process for me:1. Connected Foscam via LAN cable, checked \"DHCP clients\" list on router (I have a MacBook Pro and an Airport Extreme router) to get local Foscam IP, and then typed this into my web browser to get to the Foscam web interface. Alternatively, use the little utility included with the Foscam to get to the same place.2. Added a new login/password, deleted admin login, and set up wifi access in the Foscam settings. Then disconnected from LAN and moved Foscam to the desired location. Plug it back in and now it's working via wireless.3. Went into my router's settings and assigned a static IP to the Foscam's wifi MAC address (note: this MAC is different from the ethernet MAC). This is done with \"DHCP Reservations\" on the Airport, but of course the exact label will vary by router. Now the Foscam web interface will always be accessible at the same local address within my home network.4. To get external access outside of my home network, I went into my router's \"Port Forwarding\" settings and forwarded some external port to port 80 at the static local IP of the Foscam.5. Since I have a residential internet provider, my external IP is dynamic, which means it could potentially change. To get around this, signup for a free dyndns account. Then just use the updater client on the Foscam, itself, or one of many others that are available for free for mac, windows, and linux.Security:This is a bit confusing since the Foscam advertises \"encryption\". The part that IS secure is the Foscam's communication to/from your router via wifi. This is very good, and considering how easy it is to snoop traffic over an unprotected or WEP-protected wifi (there are even NYTimes articles describing the basics!), I would consider this a mandatory feature of any IP cam. While this is excellent to have, if you choose to make your Foscam web interface accessible from the outside internet (i.e. you did port forwarding), then this connection is public and completely unencrypted. Firstly, this means you should immediately add a new user in the Foscam settings and then delete the admin login. Even once this step is done, it means that there will be no little \"lock\" symbol in your browser indicating SSL encryption, and your new login/password and video stream will still be sent in the clear. This doesn't bother everyone, but if it does, you can use a computer on your home network to set up a VPN or SSH tunnel (easier) to make the connection encrypted (or just disable external access completely if you don't need this feature). At any rate, it's good to be aware of this limitation at least.Enhancing functionality:- Misc information on advanced features - There is a lot of useful information about these Foscams, including some more advanced topics, scattered around on various blogs and forums. Here are a couple (I'm sure google will find even more): gadgetvictims dot com, forum dot networkwebcams dot com, networkcamerareviews dot com.- mangocam dot com - Free online storage for your cam stream. What's the point of having a security camera if the crooks steal all your computers with the footage!? This site just popped up with a free public beta, so it's definitely worth checking out. Sort of like the built-in FTP/email features taken to a whole new level.- Smartphone apps - A neat way to check in on your cams remotely (but see important security note, above). IP Cam Viewer Lite works great for Android, and other reviews mention other apps for iPhone, etc.- ZoneMinder - The holy grail for getting the most out of your cam. This is a free and open-source web application for managing your cam feeds. It is sort of like mangocam, but you install it yourself on your own webserver, and it does a whole lot more. For instance, you can define different motion detection \"zones\" in the image. Maybe zone #1 is the whole image, zone #2 is just a doorway, and zone #3 is a tree that is always moving in the wind. Then you can define all sorts of complex filters, like 1) Record a section of video footage when there is any motion in zone #1, excluding zone #3, or 2) Record a section of video footage when there is any motion in zone #2, but only during work hours on weekdays; then automatically send some still screenshots to my email and upload a movie of the event to some off-site server. Wow...the options are truly endless! With just this program, some $200 linux boxes, and some Foscams, you could start a business setting up surveillance systems for people!", "Date": "March 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Active X Controls crash and freeze Window 7", "Author": "Andy \"Computer Enthusiast\"", "ReviewID": "R1K0X7SXBM8C1T", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really wanted to love this camera, the feature set appeared to be excellent.  The set up was fairly simple to set up a static IP address and I even gave it a higher port number.  It did work well in Firefox, Chrome and Safari, but the most advanced features like sound and better quality picture appear to be in Internet Explorer.  I even got it to work via my iPhone.  The problem I have is the constant freezing upon logging via Internet Explorer on my Windows 7 Laptops.  I'm running both 32 bit and 64 bit IE.  I looked for solutions and saw users have been experiencing IE issues with the buggy Active X controls since Vista.I'm on the fence if I should keep this Wireless IP Cam, since the Activex code crashes on both my laptops and freezes them.  I'm sick of having to reboot.  It's very annoying, but I'm not sure if I really need the audio anyway, I'm more interested in photos and ability to ftp, and email pictures to an account.  It's annoying since I even upgraded the firmware to the most current version and tried to follow all the useless instructions of disabling firewalls, disabling antivirus, and allowing all active x controls even whitelisted the IP in a trusted zone.  NOTHING WORKED.  So far the Active x controls are the only thing broken, besides two IR lamps seem to dim compared to the rest, the ability to pan and tilt are excellent. Image Quality is fair, seems almost better in the dark, but in the dark it's black and white.Update:I decided to keep the Camera.  I've noticed it seems to go into a \"look\" mode randomly moving everywhere occasionally, but overall I'm happy with the product.  I signed up for the free dynamic dns account, then put the info in my Verizon Fios Router and Foscam settings.  I also used my ISP and set up an FTP Account.  I also enabled UPnP, which allowed me to set up the port forwarding rules in my Verizon Router.  I'm using a higher 4 digit port number ending in zero so I can add additional cams in the future.  Other then the remote control with Internet Explorer, I was able to get all the other features to work, including motion detection, emailing via the SMTP settings (used my ISP again), and FTP of any activity out to my account (my hosting ISP is Bluehost - which allowed me to configure the FTP and SMTP info very easily).Let me know if you require any assistance configuring settings, it's convenient to access via Dynamic DNS Address or directly via the IP Address (must add high port to each to connect).  The 5 dollar iPhone app is also a nice access option.If they resolve the Win 7 Active X issues or allow sound via other browsers, I'll raise my review.  Also we'll see how the quality holds up over time.", "Date": "December 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "A basic pan/tilt IP Cam at an entry level price", "Author": "Michael \"Michael\"", "ReviewID": "R2T6YCG17QDP8U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a decent IP camera with enough features for most first time users.  I was able to configure and use the camera without having to load any of the included software without any trouble, but an average person might have trouble getting every feature working.  If you don't know what DNS or FTP means, you are one of these people.If you are planning on just sitting this on a window sill and pointing it outside as a 24/7 security camera, think again.  It works fine in the daytime, but interior reflections on the window glass make it less useful at night.  The IR LEDs reflect back off the window and effectively blind the camera.Image quality is typical of a low-cost CMOS sensor.  Color accuracy and saturation is poor, but adequate for most uses.It also has several shutter speed settings....a 60hz speed for night/low light, a 50hz speed for medium lighting, and a slow shutter speed for outdoor use.  While the camera is able to automatically adjust sensor sensitivity a bit to compensate for changes in lighting, it doesn't have an automatic shutter speed setting.  This means that if you have the shutter speed set on the \"Outdoor\" setting, it works great on a sunny day, but at night is far too dark to be useful.  You'd have to manually switch shutter speeds every day if you were using it as an unattended security camera.  Leaving it on 60hz setting and trying to view an outside scene just results in a white video image...the sunlight totally overwhelms the sensor unless you use the \"outdoor\" setting.The motion detection feature is excellent.  You can have the camera automatically email you a sequence of still photos everytime it detects motion.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well this worked.  You can specify up to 5 individual recipients.It is also capable of uploading the same still images to an FTP server if you wish to archive them for review later.  A date/time stamp on the image would have been a nice addition but isn't a feature.I did not try the audio features, thus cannot say if they are improved over the old camera.  If you are looking to integrate this camera into your DIY home security system, you should purchase the previous model (FI8908W) as this new one doesn't have the RS485 port anymore.Bottom line, whether you want to use this camera to monitor an interior room, or an outside scene, it's a good entry level camera.  Just don't expect it to be able to do both without manually making some adjustments for one or the other.", "Date": "November 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, busted my neighbors dog!", "Author":

Bought this Foscam based on the Amazon reviews, and was not disappointed.  Positioned it on the inside window sill in our living room, and before 4pm the same day, caught my neighbors dog (dogs) doing their business on our yard.  This is exactly the proof I was looking for.  The camera worked like a champ!It took me about an hour or so to figure out the wireless settings and the alarm mode (motion detection).  If you are running windows 7, you need to read the manual about how to add the IP address to your Internet Explorer trusted sites. Once I did that, I could set the folder where the video's are sent direct to my PC.Picture quality is just fine.  Although, the IR mode does not work when viewing through a window pane as I am. The lights just reflect off the glass. Otherwise (daytime) the quality is very good as you can see in my sample video.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Warming about Port Forwarding", "Author": "Harv", "ReviewID": "RK1251UG2C922", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We purchased this camera so we could monitor our home while on vacation.  I was shocked when I set up port forwarding and discovered not only did the camera have no security but it opened a really large security hole in my home Wi-Fi.When you connect to the camera over the internet via port forwarding you get a log in prompt of course, but it isn't secure, not even SSL, so the user id and password you enter is sent over the internet as clear text.  Easy as pie for some nefarious type to grab, and if all they managed to grab is your user id the camera will help them out by allowing an unlimited number of tries on the password.  To test if it would ever lock me out I entered my user id and incorrect passwords 50 times, on the 51st try I entered the correct password and it let me in.  There certainly doesn't appear to be a limit.The two things to take away from this:  1. Your user id and password is sent over the internet as clear text so it would be easy to capture.  2. Someone can just keep trying different user ids and passwords seemingly forever until they're successful.So what's the big deal, you might say.  If the camera is only pointing at my backyard or front door what do I care if someone else looks through it?The big deal is, once someone is into your camera all they have to do is click on \"Device Management\", \"Wireless LAN Setting\" and there is all the info about your Wi-Fi network.  In plain text with no attempt to hide it whatsoever is your Wi-Fi name, type of encryption, and password.  With that info they're now into your home network, able to watch your activity on the internet, watch you log into your bank, and likely able to browse your computer.  Might just as well unlock your front door and leave it open.My goal in buying this camera was to increase my home's security while on vacation but it actually decreases it.  I'll be sending it back as the security implications are just too large to overcome.A bit about me:- Software Engineer for past 5 years- System Administrator for 15 years before that- Electronics technician for 20 years before that.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Audio capability very limited.

Both work very well, and both are working within my LAN as well as across the Internet.  The manufacturer provides excellent, on-going support, and continues to add useful features to the Firmware in response to customer suggestions.As someone else said, this is an entry-level camera at an entry-level price.  You can control its movements remotely, and it has infra-red LED's so it can see in the dark; but it doesn't have optical zoom and its resolution is 640x480.  It's more than enough for baby or pet monitoring, and adequate for general surveillance, but you probably won't be able to identify faces 100 feet away, and it's not weather-resistant.  (Foscam has other cameras with optical zoom that are intended for outdoor all-weather use.)Although I was able to monitor both cameras within my LAN, at first I could only see one of them across the Internet.  The solution was to give them NON-consecutive port numbers and then supply those port numbers to my router's Port Forwarding list.  Example (LAN IP address followed by port number):Camera1: 192.168.1.121:2100Camera2: 192.168.1.122:2200For mobile monitoring, I'm using the FOSCAM SURVEILLANCE PRO app on an iPod Touch. Great app.The firmware offers a surprisingly rich feature set (such as: rotating the camera horizontall and/or vertically, motion detection, email / recording / image alerts, normal recording, periodic jpeg snapshots, notification of IP address change, viewing 1, 4, or 9 cameras at once), and all of the features I've tried have worked.  Very impressive.  This is a good product from a good company, and if their stock was publicly traded, I'd buy some.", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera!", "Author": "My Opinion", "ReviewID": "R2VY0PYWHSVKV1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:* Excellent camera,* excellent price,* lots of features,* 1 year warranty,* some Amazon buyers complained of knock-off cameras from Amazon sellers - luckily I got a real one from seller \"DBROTH\".Cons:* printed manual in box is poorly written by someone who clearly does not speak English very well (good thing there's a detailed user manual on the included CD that is written a lot better),* no SSL SMTP support (can't use your gmail account, only non SSL email accounts for emailed pictures) although you could use STunnel if you wanted to use your gmail bad enough (but you'd need to be an expert to set up STunnel with gmail),* does not capture video when motion sensor is tripped. Ideally it should record a 30sec video clip and upload that instead of snapping away 6 pictures within 6 seconds, at approximately 60 second intervals. I would have preferred a little more freedom on options with that feature.[EDIT: 01/04/2011]  Now that I've had more time to experiment, actually, it does do a 60 second video clip BUT ONLY if you have an Internet Explorer browser open and logged in to the camera.  Then, on that computer where the browser is open, there will be a 60 second video clip saved when the motion trips the camera.  Great thing for me is that if someone breaks in my home and steals the camera and my computers, I still have the photo snapshots of them when they tripped the alarm, since those are sent out immediately upon the trip.  The plan is to keep a browser window connected to the camera from work, so if my computer at home is stolen, I'll have the video clip as well.  This camera would be even more awesome if it would FTP those video clips out just like it emails out the snap shots.Tips:Use the detailed user manual on the CD - not the printed manual in the box.  The printed manual is terrible and flawed.  If you are doing the emailed-motion-alarm-trip option, make sure you click the submit button before you click the test button, and do this each time you make a change to any of the mail settings on that page.  You may have to turn on SSID broadcasting if you have it turned off in your router settings, just so the camera can identify your network during initial setup (that's not the camera's fault).  There are 2 mac addresses for this camera; 1 for hard wired, and 1 for WIFI, so don't get them mixed up. If you are not familiar with port forwarding, or DYNDNS, get a tech savvy person to help you on this one.  Don't expect things from this camera that are not advertised (i.e. plug and play, outdoor use, 360 degree pan, zoom, High Definition in low light conditions, infinity distance coverage in complete darkness, DOLBY audio from the mic/speaker, expecting to not be stopped by a company firewall which has absolutely nothing to do with this camera, expecting it to work flawlessly in every web browser known to man).

They do not provide any telephone support.  I sent them a detailed email message to their technical support address three days ago, and did not get a response.  I just called the only number for themselves that they publish, and the guy who answered said that this was a phone number for sales, and that I should email tech support.  When I told him that I did that three days ago, and they did not respond, he HUNG UP ON ME!Their website talks about how there are several counterfeit versions of their products being sold--that's sad, but not an excuse for not supporting what they sell.As far as the product itself, it works nicely hooked up via ethernet, as long as you don't need to configure anything differently than the defaults. And the night vision/IR lights work nicely for a normal-sized room.  The wifi on the unit I received is completely non-functional.  I can't tell whether it's a hardware fault, software issue, or firmware issue, but it simply does not work (I'm a computer professional, and I tried every reasonable method to diagnose and fix this, to no avail).  It is unable to detect any wifi network, public, WPA, or WPA2, over 802.11g or 802.11b, even when it is just a few feet in a direct site line from a working wifi router.  And manually configuring it doesn't work either.  I couldn't try updating their firmware, as they don't offer than on their website, but say you have to email them to get a firmware update (which I did request by email, which they never responded to).The documentation is sparse and VERY BADLY written.  The software to configure it using their web interface is likewise very badly written, to the point where it's really hard to figure out what the non-english-speaking authors intended for various labels to mean.  Whenever I updated any parameters using the Web interface and saved them, it would reboot the router and always lose every change I had ever made, except for the \"device name\", which was retained.  That is to say, changing any of the wifi settings not only doesn't work, but it is never really saved.Do yourself a favor and avoid Foscam.

My portion of getting the baby's room ready was to take care of the tech side of things.  My first task was to get our baby monitor situation squared away.  After looking at our choices I decided that an actual security camera was the best decision rather than a branded baby monitor.  Why? Many baby monitors can be tapped because their broadcasts are unencrypted. Their video systems only connect to a single handheld device with a puny 2 inch screen. Most baby monitor cameras are fixed, and can only see in a single direction.  Monitoring systems branded as baby cameras cost well over $100 once you start to include any decent features.Enter the Foscam FI8918W.  The microphone is GREAT.  I would strongly recommend adding a cheap external speaker if you need that function.  The built in speaker doesn't work well, but adding a cheap $5 speaker works wonders.  Unlike dedicated baby monitor systems you can watch from anywhere in the world by attaching your camera to your wireless network at home. I admit that setting it up takes moderate understanding of your home network. If you are an absolute beginner at such things I doubt that you'd be able to do it with ease, but a geeky friend should be able to do it in a few minutes. When you are done your camera system will have an ID & password secure web address. Not only that but you can pan and tilt to look all around the room remotely.To make things even better you can buy an app for BOTH iOS and Android called \"IP Camera Viewer\" by Robert Chou (on iTunes the developer name is NibblesnBits). The app is only a few dollars on both iOS and Android. My wife has an iPad and iPhone which are Apple iOS devices. I have a Motorola Xoom and HTC Thunderbolt (Android devices).  I can view our baby cam and listen in remotely on all devices using the app which gives me a nice big image to watch the baby with,.  Not only that, I also have the ability to fully control the camera motions.The build quality is great on this camera.  The black camera that I have is covered in a rubberized, soft touch shell.  The camera also delivers a GREAT night image in a totally dark room using it's IR system.The instructions aren't in perfect english but are clear enough that I was able to get it all done.  I would rate my technical skills in the high-moderate range and I was able to get it set up.  I did it all in just over an hour and a half from opening the box, to connecting it to my home wifi network (encrypted), to gaining internet access, and finally connecting all apps on all mobile devices.  I learned a lot about my home network setup in the process, and never felt absolutely stumped.  I did have to pause a few times and troubleshoot (hit and miss) to get it right. Even if you aren't TOTALLY confident in your skills I honestly think the average person can get it up and running. Don't be shy.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SYSTEM.I'll try to include images of it in action.

I had tried other cameras from Cisco and such and they were all good for the price.

Namely it has pan/tilt and night vision IR LEDs and can really see well in complete darkness of a whole room! Other cameras were simply a great camera but did not move so adjusting where it was pointed was difficult and could not see a whole room. I can remotely move the camera around (no zoom though which is the only bad point) from my PC and it has other CGI script function which I got from the Foscam support people to imbed the video and/or single frames into a web page.It should be noted that this is better hardware-feature-wise as the software is overly simple in many ways and does require some knowledge of DDNS and port forwarding for over the internet viewing. Other software packages such as those from Cisco/Linksys are much more robust and offer simple setups. The Foscam software does a great job with everything you would expect it to have including setting up logins and limited controls for multiple users and stuff but you need to know a little bit about what you are doing first.Overall this is the best camera for the price hardware-wise.

It DOES work by WiFi and by Ethernet. You need to set it up by Ethernet but after that, it's just fine. It works great. The small ring around the lens is for fine focusing. I was able to set it up and running to view over the web. (free dynamic DNS provider).Now this isn't a prime high quality professional surveillance device but for watching your property or checking on your pets while at work it's great. The color depth isn't the greatest in low light so don't expect a hand held camcorder image or recording. IT isn't for that. I even used it outside, protected from the elements until it got too hot this summer. This camera is NOT for outdoor use but it worked fine for me mounted up high under my 3 foot roof over hang.If you want an inexpensive monitoring camera for around the house or workplace, I would recommend this item. The browser based control allows I believe up to 12 of the same camera to be setup and monitored from the same interface, just like a security office in a store. In fact this past July 4th the fireworks stand was using Foscam's to watch their shoppers. Visit the Foscam website and read their warning about fakes. They tell you how to spot a fake.First, this camera works good and is a great buy for the price but there are a few things to consider.1. No zoom (not a big deal for me)2. The instructions are poorly translated. You have to really get your head into the reading to understand it and the manual it comes with is printed so small it's hard to read. Download the manual from Foscam's website.3. The biggest thing is the cam doesn't upload, email or record unless you use IE and only if the browser is open. The record and sound features use ActiveX and only with IE.4. Also the browser (IE or Firefox) will crash if you give the cam too many commands too fast.5. DDNS setup was a little confusing but with the downloaded manual and a little concentration it not too bad. You will need a good working knowledge of your router, MODEM and mid-level networking skills.6. Frames per Second (FPS) settings in live video will not save from session to session or even when you leave live mode and go to \"Device Info\" or \"Device Settings\" area. Every time you leave \"Live Video\" mode the settings revert back to default.7. After it records a video triggered by motion detection a Windows Explorer window opens right in front of the browser to show you the recorder AVI files location. A little annoying. Get around it by sliding the window off the screen so it doesn't block the browser and leave it open.8. It has manual pan/tilt controls and automatic \"Patrol\" to pan and tilt automatically but it patrols it's full range of up/down, left/right. There should be a way to set the patrol range in degrees (108 or less) so it doesn't scan the walls or sky/ground.Not a huge deal but it would be better if the cam control was not browser based and not dependent on Internet Explorer and ActiveX.I expected to install and set the camera up to monitor an area, set the record path and alarm settings, turn the monitor off, close the control application and leave it run. There may be some 3rd party applications that will work outside of a browser but I haven't checked.All the above quirks are of small concern EXCEPT for the dependency on IE and that it must be left open to record. I recommend using this camera on a dedicated PC because the live video uses a lot of bandwidth even on a 100 mbps - 802.11G network. Even wired to 100 mbps Ethernet only, not connected by WiFi it still uses a lot of bandwidth.

The ability to link up multiple cameras, to hear sound from the internal mic, and setup per user accounts are all really nice features, but can only be taken advantage of via Internet Explorer and ActiveX.About the only thing you can do with this camera in a non-IE browser is view video, which works well and serves my purpose as I just want to monitor my 2 yr old daughter at night in her bedroom. It's really ashame though that in this era of multiple browsers that a majority of this camera's features are hampered by its dependency on Internet Explorer/ActiveX.", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "No Audio", "Author": "Johnny W Poston", "ReviewID": "R38ONJQLR9DSBC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So I learned after recieving this camera that the audio ONLY works if you use IE (Iphone Apps...No Audio, CHrome, No Audio...Opera, No Audio...

We were notified of a slight increase in criminal activity in the area, and I have a lot of expensive things at my place.  I have insurance, but wanted to have something else keeping an eye on things while I was at work.  This camera seemed to offer everything I was looking for.  And yes, it does have a lot of cool features.  You can connect it wirelessly, so all it needs is power.  You can have it drop snapshots of camera activity out to an FTP share for later review.  You can even tilt and pan the camera using the web interface.  It features scheduled observation, so you can detect motion and snap shots during certain hours.  IR mode allows you to see even in dark rooms.  You can have it email you with any motion detected.  On paper it sounds like a dream.  Unfortunately, most of these features are a bit of a pain due to what I can only describe as clear, blatant oversights on the part of FOSCAM.First, the motion detection.  It's a cluster.  The problem is that what it sees as \"motion\" is not really motion all the time.  When I think motion I think of a physical object at a certain position ending up at a different position within one second of the previous position; in other words, if I took a ball and threw it, that's motion.  If I open blinds, the blinds move, but nothing else does.  The camera picks up light changes as motion.  That's irritating, because I have high windows where the sun will shine through trees, causing natural shadows that the camera can't seem to ignore.  Thus I get blasted with upwards of 100 or so emails, each containing about 10 shots, of nothing but light shifts.  There is a \"Sensibility\"(sic) setting in the camera which I can only assume should have been \"Sensitivity\", but dropping this down to even 1 doesn't seem to make a difference.Where that really becomes a problem is file storage.  Because it doesn't store video shots of detected motion and instead takes snapshots, your FTP share will fill up rather quickly with individual, false hits.  I suppose there's nothing that can be done about this, but it's extremely frustrating that the camera cannot apparently determine three-dimensional objects vs. light shifts.  I just deleted over 7,000 JPGs.Randomly, the camera will just lockup and require unplugging to get it back up and running.  Then it needs to go through its axial calibration again and you will lose some of your settings.  No real explanation for this, it will just stop responding.The web interface offered does let you pan and tilt the camera.  It also lets you enable or disable IR mode; of course, during the day IR mode is somewhat pointless, but you can do it.  The problem with the web interface is the scheduling.  It wants you to click individual squares for each hour - you can't just say \"Every week day from 8AM to 8PM\".  You have to go to the 24 hour grid and click each individual square that corresponds to an hour.  You then have to do that same step for each day.  So Wednesday 1pm, Tuesday 1pm, Monday 1pm, Sunday 1pm, Saturday 1pm, Friday 1pm, Thursday 1pm....then do it all over again for 2pm, 3pm, etc. until you're finished.  Mercy on your soul if you want the camera to monitor motion for 8 hours every week day.Ultimately, it gets the job done, and it's a fine camera in terms of quality and IR capabilities.  I just wish that they would get smarter with the basic technology.  The web interface could certainly use some rewriting.", "Date": "February 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "For the price, NO competition.", "Author": "D. Hollinrake", "ReviewID": "R29MS6RIFIX3LV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "*Update 10 Aug 2012*No issues with this camera still. Foscam now has a new model out, Foscam FI8910W Wireless/Wired Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with IR-Cut Filter for True Color Images - 8 Meter Night Vision and 3.6mm Lens (67\u00b0 Viewing Angle) - Black NEWEST MODEL, and unless you can get a great deal on this older version, I'd suggest getting the newer one.Quick overview------------------In this price range, there is absolutely NO competition that I have found for this type of camera. It has pan and tilt, paired up with a microphone and a speaker for 2-way audio, and then you have the IR LED's around the lens for your night vision. The biggest downside is the manual, the one I received with it was not too helpful. It's the norm with most manuals for products coming from China it seems. Luckily I'm getting pretty good at setting these things up and searching the internet hasn't failed me yet for getting an answer I've needed.This is not for the technological caveman. It's not exactly what I'd call \"plug and play\" (once you get one working though, it's really easy to set up more). To have access to this over the Internet, you're going to need to know  a bit about your network and router in case the UPnP doesn't work (or at least a friend who knows so long as you have a nice dinner for them afterwards).Quick Notes------------------Few things I'd like to clear up from what I've seen in other reviews:-My camera appears a genuine FOSCAM as far as I can tell, it updated without issues to the latest firmware.-You have the option to rate the product and rate the seller. If you receive the wrong item, contact the seller, don't leave bad reviews on a product that you didn't get to use.- foscam.us is not the official website for support, they are just another reseller and only give support for items they sell. (Do you ask Dell to fix your HP computer for free because HP gave you a warranty? It's a computer after all. They didn't sell it so why should they foot the bill to support something your bought elsewhere?)-Use foscam.com and check to see who is an authorized reseller.-If you need the support, buy it from the foscam.us site.Detailed Review------------------I currently have one FI8918W inside and three FI8904W outside. I use them to monitor my dogs more than anything and to watch the front door where the FedEx and UPS guy leave packages. I recently bought a second one as a gift for a friend to use as a baby monitor. They had a $250 video baby monitor on their baby shower list and they agree that this camera blows that one out of the water. They can even use their iPad/iPhones so there's no need to tote around an extra monitor.One of the things that irritates me with the camera is the constant need for it to reboot after what feels like EVERY little change you make. I exaggerate, but not by much. Not a huge deal though once you finish configuring it to your liking.With IE, you have access to ALL the options this camera has to offer. This is because it uses ActiveX controls which, you guessed it, only work with IE. Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc, can still view the camera feed but you lose a few of the features, most notably, audio. Just use the secondary login button below the main one for IE. Supposedly you should have audio with VLC installed along with it's plugin but I haven't heard any audio using Firefox while I was testing. Honestly not that big of a dead for me because rarely will I be using my desktop to view my camera feeds. I mostly use my android phone to pull up the video streams. I use a program called IP Cam Viewer on my phone. The free version of the app doesn't allow for audio but the paid version (~$4-5) allows the audio function. Same app is also available for all your \"igadgets\". No idea about blackberry's but I'd guess there's something out there that would work.That's basically all I have to say, many other people have already posted quite a lot of useful reviews.My Setup-----------------I'll run through the settings I have on my camera, hopefully it might help someone else that might be having an issue. All this is being done through IE. It has the most functionality and a majority of people reading this review most likely have IE installed on their computer.Device Info:Gives you info on the camera, not really much to say about itAlias Settings:Name of the camera that will show up if you have DNS running on your router or when you search for more IP cameras on your network when setting up multiple cameras to be viewed from one device. (Note: More on this in the Multi-Device Settings below)Date & Time Settings:Set your time zone for wherever you're at. I have my sync with an NTP server us.pool.ntp.org but you can just as easily use any of the ones from the drop-down list. You can also tell it to just copy your PC's current time, but if you have time-stamps recorded on the video, you might as well use a NTP server to keep it in sych.Users Settings:You can add more usernames along with passwords they're use to log in and different permission levels for different accounts. Visitors can only look at the video feed and any other video feeds from other cameras that you have linked with this camera. Operator is able to move the camera around. Administrator can change the camera settings.Multi-Device Settings:This is actually really cool but you should go through and set up everything else on each of your cameras before coming back to this setting. I think it should be towards the bottom of the side menu instead of near the top. When using IE, you can actually view up to 9 different IP cameras. (Apparently they haven't figured out a way to use something other than ActiveX controls to allow this in Firefox, Chrome, etc...) The reason I say come back to this is that you'll need the other cameras configured and online for this utility to find them on the network and this can save having to type them in. All you need to do it add the username and password for the camera you're adding. Then, you'll only have to log into the one IP camera to see ALL of your cameras.Basic Network Settings:I have my camera set to pull and IP address from DHCP server. My router is set to always give the same IP address to the camera based on MAC address instead of setting a static IP on the camera itself (Saves me from having to manually change it later if I wanted to move it temporarily to a new network). I changed the http port for each of the camera's to a non-standard port, by default, they're set to port 80 so all you need to do is type in the ip address in a browser. (Now I have to remember to type the ip and port for it to show me the web interface.)Wireless LAN Settings:I'm not using the wireless with mine so I can't comment on anything to do with the wifi setup and reliability.ADSL Settings:I didn't touch the ADSL settings, I had no need.UPnP Settings:This is the setting on whether you want the camera to try to enable port-forwarding on your router on it's own. This used to not work but was supposedly fixed in the latest firmware update, however, I haven't tested this out to be sure. Mine is set to enabled and honestly I think I could disable it because I have everything manually forwarded on my router anyways. On the device info page it will say if it was success or not on configuring UPnP.DDNS Service Settings:I have this set to none, I have my router set up to use the dyndns service making it so the camera didn't need it configured as well. If your router isn't already using one of these options, be sure to set it up on your camera.Mail Service Settings:Allows the camera to send off emails in event of an alarm. I currently don't use, I may set that up eventually but I still haven't decided if I'll do that or run separate software on one of my computers to be in control of all the alerts and recording from my cameras.MSN Settings:This one showed up after the last firmware update. I'm assuming it's to allow the use of the camera with MSN chat program...FTP Service Settings:Allows you to specify a FTP server that the camera will use to upload images. I think this was about the most frustrating part to set up. You have to type in your settings and HIT SUBMIT to save them before hitting the \"Test\" button. Once you understand that, the \" Please set at first, and then test.\" writing next to the \"test\" button makes sense. I thought it was telling me to type the information in before hitting the button. I feel a bit stupid after finally hitting submit and then the test button after trying to figure out why it wasn't working for an hour.Alarm Service Settings:Once enabled it will give the options to set the \"Motion Detect Sensibility\" That's right, that is not a typo, that's what it says. I'm guess sensitivity is what they meant. Play around with this to make sure the wind doesn't cause it to set off the alarm and that someone can't walk past it and NOT set it off. I'd rather have the false positive's than missing actual alarms. This is where your mail and FTP settings can be enabled to actually be used by the camera. You can also set up the interval of the upload to the FTP server. Another useful feature found here is the scheduler option. This will allow you to tell the camera when you want the alarm active. It allows 15min increments set individually for each day of the week.PTZ Settings:Lets you change the settings for pan and tilt speeds (the camera doesn't zoom so no idea why they have the \"Z\" in the \"PTZ\"). You can set the number of times it will patrol when you hit the button, whether or not you want to disable presets, and finally, it allows you to tell the camera to go to \"preset 1\" after if completes booting so it can be pointed the correct direction.That's pretty much it with the menu options for updating firmware, back-up and restoring configs, and rebooting the device.Closing:------------------For the price I paid, I'm extremely satisfied with the camera. The only reason I deducted a star was for the Chinglish in the manual and the web gui making it more difficult than it should be to figure out the settings.

Install the software from the mini-cd. I ran into my first issue here, as the icon that appeared on the desktop did not point to the program. On my 64-bit Vista machine, the program is installed into c:\\windows\\syswow64, but the icon pointed to c:\\windows\\system32. That was easily fixed by adjusting the icon properties, and seemed to be an anomaly - the uninstalled and reinstalled, and it did not happen again.2. When you run the ipcamera program, the window you get (with various device ip addresses) doesn't give you a clue as to which one is the camera. Unlike the picture in the manual on page 2, the camera is NOT labeled foscamdemo, but came up on my machine as \"anonymous\". It took a while to figure out that this entry was indeed the camera. If you double-click on the entry, it will open to the camera configuration page, which was the clue I needed. By the way, you can change the name of the camera from \"anonymous\" by using the \"Alias Settings\" entry in the \"Administrator\" section of the camera configuration.3. The next issue came when the camera demanded a login id and password (page 3 of the manual). LOOK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CAMERA and you'll find a sticker with that information. You can change the id and password from the \"User Settings\" in the \"Administrator\" section.4. On page 4, the \"share key\" is the password for your wireless network, assuming you've secured it (you really should!).5. As one of the other reviewers noted, after you reboot the camera and (while it is rebooting) remove the network cable, it uses a new ip address once it comes up on the wireless network. You'll need to rerun the ipcamera application to find the camera's new ip address.6. There are some other confusing items as you continue the wireless set up and specify parameters to get it to work with dynamic DNS using a free dyndns account. First, in the Basic Network Settings (page 10), the default is to obtain the IP address from the DHCP server. You need to turn that off (uncheck the box) and follow the instructions in the manual. On my router (DLink on Comcast), the DNS Server only shows up in the WAN section of the status, and that entry is too large to fit in the DNS Server field for the camera. Instead, use the Gateway value - that seems to work.7. When configuring the port forwarding (page 11), you can use port 80 if your ISP doesn't block it (Comcast doesn't seem to) and then the URL you use to access the camera remotely doesn't require a port number.6. The biggest issue with this camera is that with IE 8 (running in both 64-bit Vista and 64-bit Win7), the video stream freezes, though you can still move the camera. In Win7, it may start up again after a few minutes (for a little while), then freeze again. Also, closing the tab and sometimes switching between the video feed and the Administrator section crashes IE8. I don't have the same problem with Google Chrome in Vista,  but as Andy noted, some of the features don't work, and I also noticed that Chrome doesn't allow for multiple cameras (the additional buttons for cameras 2-9  are missing). Also, in Win7, even with Chrome the video stream freezes, and the basic network settings come up blank.I guess I'll have to return it, after having spent two days setting it up.

That is a great product- but after many times being dropped, the charging cable no longer stays in the handset, so it's no longer portable (still works fine when plugged in, though- we use it at night)However, switching to the Foscam is one of the best decisions I've ever made, at least with regards to monitoring my baby :)I could have bought a couple of these cameras for the price of the Summer monitor set. Much of the price there, I imagine, goes toward the fancy portable monitor and LCD screen. However, if you're a geeky parent who may have one or more smartphones or tablets lying around, you probably already realized that you don't actually need another wireless screen.Any IP camera can get you there, but this Foscam is an amazing value for the price. The only feature it does not have that I was looking for is zoom- however, at nearly 1MP there is plenty of room for digital zoom, and the picture quality is crisp enough to make this worthwhile.I have not found an app that takes advantage of this (digital zoom feature- more on apps later!), however on my Mac and I can hold Control and then scroll, and it zooms in on the window. This works surprisingly well (use one finger while holding control to pan around), but only applies while on a computer (and a Mac, at that).The camera itself required some \"modification\" to really work as a baby monitor. This mainly involved covering up all the LEDs (including the really unnecessary one on the power transformer) with electrical tape. Blinky network activity lights do not help babies sleep!I was also concerned that the IR LEDs may keep her up- they are bright enough to be visible at night, as a low red glow. I doubt it's an issue, honestly, but since I had my Summer cameras still attached, I could easily turn off the Focam's (much brighter, more agressive) LEDs. After some tweaking to the brightness/contrast settings, it now works great, and is completely \"stealth\".If you don't happen to have another night vision camera just lying around (understandable!), you can try using the built-in LEDs. I've found no way to adjust their brightness- I believe the brightness controls are an unrelated, camera-level adjustment. So, it's either on or off for that IR ring.Another option, if you're a super geek, is to rig up your own. IR LED's are cheap, and you could easily put as many of them basically anywhere in your room (a AA battery could probably power a single LED for years...). I may explore this option in the future, but since I have two Summer cameras, it's probably not something I need to worry about. Radio Shack is your friend if you go down this road! :)As for the Foscam itself, it's a great camera. Pan/Tilt work very well, they make a little bit of noise, but nothing some white noise doesn't drown out.The image quality is superb, both at day and night. See some examples of night vision here, using both the on-board IR LED Ring, and using one of the Summer cameras instead:[...]Remote control works very well. I've tested in FireFox, Chrome and IE- both on Mac and PC. The interface is not super pretty or fancy, but the fact that this camera has an on-board web server that is (reasonably) secure and serves a video stream is pretty fundamentally astounding in itself. Pan/Tilt control is also available here, as are controls for brightness, contrast, and turning on/off the IR ring.The web interface is also how you set up the camera itself. On first use, you'll plug into a router, and then the camera will show up on your network via DHCP. If you are familiar with how to check your router's DHCP table, you probably don't need any of the bundled software- though the fact that the manuals are included in PDF form was a nice touch.Once you've connected to the camera, you set up it's wifi like you would any wifi device. The only caveat here, it did not auto-detect my wifi network, which is set up to broadcast it's SSID. I had to enter the info in manually- including selecting the right security type. This can often be a hang-up for an \"average joe\" (or jane) setting up a network- so beware of that. If you have \"a guy\" you call for things like troubleshooting your wifi, you may want to give that person a call when this camera comes in!However, setup itself was very painless. The camera changed IP addresses when unplugged and relocated, but that's to be expected if you've left DHCP on- it's on the wifi now, so effectively a different device from the router's point of view.You can, however (and I did) set it up with a static IP, which is nice. (Again, semi-advanced networking stuff here, but not required!)This is handy if you want to view your video from outside your home. A simple port forward on your router will accomplish this- or, if you have some web server experience, an Apache (or similar) proxy is a great way to really secure this. You don't want anyone on in the internet trying to hack into your camera... best to hide it behind an actual web machine- or just keep it private, depending on your needs. An internet-enabled set of these throughout the house would make for an excellent nanny cam system!From a software perspective, you probably don't need to use the camera's web interface, except in a pinch.IP cameras are fairly standard, and there is copious software available to view and control these cameras.I am currently using Foscam 2 on iOS (amazing on the iPad, useable on iPhone 3G) and IP CamViewer on Android. Both are paid apps, but well worth the price in both cases.IP CamViewer is interesting, in that it allows access to the audio features of this camera- something I have not found to be easy.This camera actually has two-way audio, including both on-board mic/speaker, and line in/line out. Impressive!Using IP CamViewer, I can turn on/off audio both ways, individually. So, I can listen in, or even talk to my baby over her new \"monitor\". (She's not old enough yet that I feel the two-way feature is really appropriate, but that's a personal opinion!)The audio, though, is very clicky and poppy. I would not recommend this as an audio monitor, at least not for overnight use. Get an inexpensive traditional audio-only monitor to go along with this- I highly recommend the Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White. I'm going to be adding a review there, too- but in short, this is a great monitor whose only downfall is use of 9 volt batteries- a non-issue if it's a full-time plugged-in nighttime monitor. To sum it up, you can't go wrong with this camera. I'm hoping I can convince my wife that we need at least one more- I'd love to make use of that grid view in the apps!", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice Option for home monitoring", "Author": "Poppa", "ReviewID": "R38BFZ3GK2Y9OC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered 4 of these plus one outdoor camera,  the set up is easy if you are just going to use these internally.

Use [...] to get 3 free addresses, 12 bucks a year for unlimited redirects.  The best way to do this is to set up a static address for each camera on your router, then punch holes for web service through some ports standard is port 80 but you can use 8080, 8081, 8082 etc, etc.  one for each camera.  Now configure each camera to use those ports and assign the cameras to each static address.  Most cable companies use dynamic addresses for home users.

Admittedly, the \"Chinglish\" in the installation guide is tiresome and perhaps a bit vague. Some people just need more hand holding than others. To those who complain about poor resolution, color rendition, frame rate, or audio quality, what do you expect from a camera that retails for under $90? If your requirement is to read license plates from a half mile away, I'll be happy to steer you to a $3000 megapixel camera. The simple fact of the matter is that these cameras offer tremendous bang for the buck. If you know what you're doing, they're very easy to set up. No, I'm not a Foscam shill. I'm a machine vision / automation engineer. For those who are less technically inclined, I've included a step by step guide in outline form at the end of this review. The guide is slanted a bit to Mac users because I prefer Macs to PCs. However, I live in both worlds. Hopefully, Amazon's primitive comment section doesn't make the outline's format hard to follow and this helps those who are having trouble.Pros:* inexpensive* IP addressable* wireless communication* speed adjustable pan/tilt* patrol capable* 8 programmable location presets* color* IR night vision to 8 meters* 2-way audio* motion & sound alarm capability* email notification* small, unobtrusive, attractive* wall or ceiling mountable with included mount* image can be flipped and mirrored in ceiling mount situations* the 3.6 mm lens can be replaced with longer focal lengthsCons:* no zoom, but it's a $90 camera* resolution is only VGA quality, it's not megapixel* color can be washed out or pinkish on overcast days because it has no IR filter* internal speaker is rather weak, but an external powered speaker can be connected* motion detection is a little rudimentary, use security software insteadSet up of the Foscam FI8918W Camera\ufffc\ufffcI.

Accessing the Camera.----A. Viewing the camera from within the local network.-------1. Use the included IP Camera Tool program to point your web browser----------to the camera or enter the camera's address in your browser's URL field.----------The camera can then be bookmarked for future access without opening IP Camera Tool.----------Users of Internet Explorer with ActiveX installed should have two way audio.----------Chrome, Firefox, and Safari users will not.-------2. Use a good security camera program such as Evocam for Mac and Blue Iris for Windows.----------When adding local cameras, enter the local IP address.----------The motion detection and alarm features in these programs are more robust----------than what is offered in the cameras themselves.----------A tip for Evocam users, the pan buttons work in reverse.-------3. Mac users have another nice option that provides two way audio with full control of the camera.----------The program is called uFoscam. It costs $7 at the App store.----------The program is pretty self explanatory with two main actions per camera, Setup and Control.----------It can control up to nine cameras.----------a) Setup.-------------(1) Click Setup to display the installed camera list.-------------(2) Click the + button to add a camera.-------------(3) Fill in the requested information for the camera.-----------------In the IP or DDNS field, enter the camera's local IP address for a camera on the local network (10.0.1.101)-----------------or the camera's DDNS if the camera will be viewed over the internet (username.no-ip.com).-------------(4) Click on the Gear button to open a pop up window with additional configuration items.-------------(5) Click on the Function tab and check the Invert Pan box.-----------------This will make the pan buttons work correctly.-------------(6) Click Save to add the camera to the list.----------b) Control.-------------(1) Click Control to display the installed cameras.-------------(2) Camera images may displayed individually or tiled by clicking the appropriate button.-------------(3) If displayed individually, they may be paged using the arrow buttons in the lower right corner of the window.-------------(4) The controls are arranged and function similarly to what is seen with the browser.-------------(5) The two buttons to the right of the compass control the audio.----------------The top button turns the audio on and off.----------------The lower button toggles between talk and listen.----B. Viewing the camera over the internet.-------1. Enter the camera's DDNS domain name in your browser's URL field followed by a colon and the camera's port number.----------The format should look like this: username.dyndns.ws:8001 or username.no-ip.com:8001.----------This address can then be bookmarked for future access.----------Again, users of Internet Explorer with ActiveX installed should have two way audio.----------Chrome, Firefox, and Safari users will not.-------2. Use Evocam or Blue Iris. When adding cameras which will be viewed over the internet,----------enter the camera's DDNS domain name followed by a colon and the camera's port number.-------3. Mac users may use uFoscam to have two way audio. Again, just enter the camera's DDNS domain name.IV. A comment about updating camera firmware.----A. NEVER update camera firmware using the wireless connection.-------If communication is interrupted, you just made a brick!!!----B.

I have revised the setup to make it easier Here is the set up:To access from your PC when you are on your home network as a baby cam etc:1. Plug your camera into your router with the cable provided, plug it into the wall. The camera head will rotate. this is normal2. Run the IP Camera tool that is provided on the CD. It will find your camera and give an IP address. Enter this address into your browser. A login will popup. Enter Admin and you then click on live video and see your camera. You can now get into your camera and change settings or view and use as a baby cam or monitor from any home computerThats it! for a wired setup. Any changes you want to make can be made in the Device Management section after you login....Note: after you make a change, the camera will reset almost every time.NOW A WIRELESS SETUP!While connected to your camera in the Ethernet wired mode, click on the device management:1. click on wireless lan setup2. click scan and click on your wireless device that appears in the box (sometimes you have to scan multiple times)3. Most of the info will be automatically loaded. I just added my wifi sharekey code.4. Now Click the submit button, the camera will reset, you can now disconnect your cable. Wait a minute or two. If the wireless takes you will see the led in the back blinking very fast. If the led  is not blinking fast redo the setup again for the wireless. Wait a few minutes then Run IP camera tool and you should see the IP address of your camera. Enter it into your browser just like you did with the wired setup and you are all set! NOTE: if you constantly have problems connecting, reset your camera with a pin pushed into the reset button and hold for 20 seconds or so and repeat all the above starting with the wired mode. I had to do this on one camera only. Its rare but could happen.I found the camera to be fantastic, the IR mode in darkness is incredible, you have full control of the camera and the audio listening works great with IE and can work with firefox or Google Chrome after you load the free audio plugin VLC player. Good idea to click on device management and type your new password in user settings. I use firefox and while watching the live video, on the left you will see PT numbers. With these you can adjust your presets. Move the camera to point at a certain object, press the set to the left of the preset button and when ever you press  go to the right of the numbers, the camera will automatically move to that preset. Very Cool! In device management you can go to PTZ settings and set the PT speed to 1 for a faster speed.FYI, if you lose power the IP access code could change so I put my router on a UPS unit (a battery backup power supply). These are pretty cheap now a days. I also use it on my cable modem, so if I lose power I still have internet!Next how to set up port forwarding with a android app to access your camera on the phone.Go into your router. IF you do not know the access code google it. I needed to setup my daughters Verizon Router and I just googled it. Go to port forwarding in the router and enter the camera IP address and mac address and that's it. you can now put any of the iphone or android camera apps enter your camera Ip address and you can see your camera from anywhere. I use IP CAM PRO on my android smart phone. Good LuckI don't know why so many people have problems setting this up, when so many people in their reviews explain everything you need! The wired and the wireless have two different IP addresses and their MAC addresses are listed on the bottom of the camera!

I decided to purchase Foscam's version of this model based on the reviews.For the most part, I'm pleasantly content with the device, but there would be a few things I would add.  This device would be so much better if it had a micro disc slot added.  I also own an LTS LTCIP830MV-W IP camera, and I really enjoy the added SD feature, since I don't have an FTP or an HTTP site to load recordings in.  Which leads me to my other critique; I have not figured out how to record video on this device.Setting up locally is simple.  You have to plug the device into your router, using the LAN cable it came with.  Once the device has been picked up by your router, it will get a local IP address in which you will use to log in to the unit.  As of right now, your username is \"admin\" and there's no password.If you're going wireless, be sure the antenna is firmly attached.  You will need some patience with this unit.The first thing you want to do is log in to your unit.  Once you're there, go to the \"wireless LAN Settings\" section of the device, press \"Scan\" if nothing happens, press \"Scan\" again, and it will list a few networks.  Select  your network, and add all the encryption settings that match your router, then put your network password.  Once you do this, the camera resets itself for 30 seconds.  Once it starts up, you'll need to disconnect the power cable from the back of the camera, and then disconnect the LAN cable.  Wait about 30 seconds before reconnecting the power cable.  When you do that, you'll have to wait about another 30 seconds or so.  By this time, it's pretty certain that you've connected your camera wirelessly.  The local IP address will change.  You'll have to use that new one to access the camera.  Go to your router again to see the new IP address of your camera.Remote viewing on this camera is not as complicated if you know what to do.  You will more than likely need DDNS Service for your device, if you don't have a static IP.I get my service at dtdns(dot)com, where it's free.What I did for this is assign DDNS access on my router, that way I have a \"locked\" IP address to access the camera.Once you configure your router with dtdns access, you need to set the camera's local ip address for port forwarding on your router. Once you do that, you need to assign a port number for your camera.  For example, if your DDNS router IP is 192.192.192.1 the port number could be :8080, therefore to access your camera, the IP address would be 192.192.192.1:8080.Once the above is configured, you'll need to go into your camera locally, and go to the \"Basic Network Settings\" check \"Obtain IP from DHCP Server\" and put the Http Port you've assigned the device in your router (for example :8080) You'll know you did it right if you get a \"cannot connect\" page.  That means that your router's address is now the DDNS IP, (don't forget to add the port number at the end to access it).Setting up Mail Service on this device was easy if you have the right information. It also doesn't require a reboot like it often does with changing passwords or network settings.The best e-mail you can use is gmail.  I had assigned a hotmail account to e-mail forward alerts, and hotmail eventually sends you a \"we need to confirm if you're human\" e-mail and will stop your services after about 8 alerts.  Gmail has no problem with that.The settings for Mail Service is the following:Sender: name(at)gmail(dot)comReciever 1: receiver(at)gmail(dot)comSMTP Server: smtp.gmail.comSMTP Port:  465Transport Layer Security: TLSNeed Authentication: CheckedSMTP User: name(at)gmail(dot)comSMTP Password: passwordThen press submit and then press test to see if everything went well.You can also send yourself text messages, by simply finding out what the text message e-mail is for your service provider.  for example, AT&T;'s text message e-mail is yourcellnumber(at)txt(dot)att(dot)net. You won't get images, but you'll get alerts.My main problem with the device is that it reboots too often for minimal changes.  It takes the device 30 seconds for practically any change you do.  I am certain that I got a little spoiled with the LTS camera;  there's no booting necessary for any type of change for the LTS.I'm probably going to keep the device since it does have more pros than cons.  I just really wish recording was simpler than it tends to appear.  If I could merge the two cameras I have into one, it would be the perfect device.  This device is pretty close to what I'm looking for.  IT's about 80 percent to my standards.  There are things I don't like about the LTS camera as well, but it makes up for certain things just like the Foscam does.If you're looking for a baby monitor camera, I would highly recommend this device, even though it's not compatible with the Baby Monitor HD iPhone app.  It is definitely self efficient though, with e-mail alerts and even text messaging.

You need to disconnect the LAN cable immediately after clicking save in the wireless settings. I actually dropped my security down to WEP because I couldn't get it to connect via WiFi. This still didn't work. I finally gave up and set my security settings back to what they were when I started (WPA2 personal - TKIP or AES).

My business and my guitar/amp collection are both in the same room in my house, so I wanted a way to check in and make sure everything was ok while I was gone.  This camera worked perfectly for that purpose.The Ups:  You really can go online anywhere and view live video as well as receive emails with still shots if the motion detector is tripped.  It has night vision, and you can move it manually and control any function from anywhere!  All for less than $100!The Downs:  I'm a programmer, and it took me 3 days to get everything up and running.  That being said, IT'S NOT THE PRODUCT'S FAULT.  I have programming experience, but NOT networking.  The nature of ANY device that will connect to the internet as well as a local network the way this does is complicated!  If I were familiar with configuring DNS, Port Forwarding through an AT&T; U-Verse firewall protected router and a few other hardware specific tricks, then it would have been a 10 minute setup.  NO manufacturer can be responsible for configuring other equipment beyond their own can they??I contacted the company's support and they were absolutely AWESOME!!  Seriously.  The phone was answered by a person, who said the tech was busy, and could he call me back.  5 minutes later, I was on the phone with what seemed like a product engineer!!  He assessed the situation and pointed out what my problems were likely to be... correctly... the first time.  No scripted - level one - call center, this guy was great.If you're comfortable with networking, router and hardware firewall configuration then this camera's setup will be a breeze.  If you're somewhat computer literate and patient enough to learn some new skills, then you'll be ok.  If you're a cranky S.O.B. who thinks you'll plug it in and it'll just work, don't bother unless you're willing to leave a network cable connected, and only use it from your home network.

If you have DDWRT firmware, create a new Vlan SSID with wireless security \"NONE\" instead of messing with existing SSID.5) Go to \"Wireless Lan Settings\" page on the camera. Click \"Scan\" (and nothing will show up). Wait for a minute or two. Click \"Scan\" again and you should see all your routers listed there.6) Now select the SSID and submit.7) While it is restarting, pull the ethernet cable out of the camera and it should be connected wirelessly to your router.8) Now hurray your camera should work wirlessly.9) Now set your router back to whatever wireless security you want. If DDWRT, just delete the newly created VLAN SSID.10) Now go back to Wireless page and follow above steps 3, 4, 5. Make sure you entered the security key.11) Now it should connect wirelessly with security.Audio setup:1) There is nothing to setup for audio other than logging in to your camera page and select \"Visitor\" and then you should see in the bottom left all your cameras listed.2) Go to camera number (1, 2 , 3...) and Click \"Speaker\" button for camera audio and \"Mic\" button for you to speak to camera.Gmail (Email) setup:1) Go to \"Mail Service Settings\" page.

Most of the reviews for the Foscam FI8918W were positive and I thought that the few negatives were either inexperienced users or random manufacturing flaws, so I went ahead with my purchase. I purchased directly from Foscam and the camera itself arrived quickly and matched my expectations. The setup was simple and straightforward, although the printed documentation and included software were a bit lacking.Once the camera was connected, powered up, and addressed on my network it was easy to use through my browser. The pan/tilt functions of the camera are easy to use and it responds well. The web interface is compatible with Internet Explorer and Firefox, but I did have issues with it not working properly in IE9/x64. Noticeable anomalies are the poor CCD sensor for color interpretation. This gets worse in dim light, but even with an outdoor image in full sunlight, green looks purple, and red looks gray. I checked the Foscam website to insure I had the latest firmware and my camera was up to date. Unfortunately there were no newer updates, so I guess this is a deficiency of the hardware itself. Other oddities include this camera's tendency to go offline for hours at a time without any notable cause. The camera I have setup is 250 miles away, so I don't have the ability to reset it remotely. When it becomes inaccessible, the router it's connected through is still online and accessible, but the camera itself is offline and unavailable. After waiting about 24hours, the camera magically comes back online each time, but overall downtime is about 40-50%. Other reviews and blogs have indicated this to be a known issue, and most users have to hard reset the camera with a power cycle to fix it each time.The overall rating for this device is sub-par as it has so much potential and falls short in so many areas.  If the CCD image were clearer and more accurate to true color, and the online/offline issues were resolved this could easily make it a #1 rated IP cam.  Sadly, I don't see much acknowledgement from Foscam in their FAQ's or blogs that these problems exist, let alone any documentation of work in progress to address or remediate them.  At a price point in the $89 range, it's hard to beat this device for light occasional use.  But if you're looking for a consistently reliable IP camera that delivers color accurate, clear images - this probably isn't for you. You probably want to go with TrendNet, D-link, or Cisco.

It will be a good idea to look at those. Ignore the technical jargon as these are not well explained3-The best it to do the setup with internet explorer as it supports all the features for the cameras.

Follow the instructions in the quick reference to run the camera on wireless. This will allow you to access the camera from the software on your PC from home.If you want to access the cam from a remote location, or 3G, then you need to program your camera IP into your router. Your router has an IP address. Get it fron the internet like whatismyip.com. It is kind of your home address. Your camera has an IP address, which is like a mail location inside your home. You need to get your router to foreward the mail to your cam. This is done by programming the camera IP address into your router. This should be under port forewarding in the router. Once you get to that page, enter the camera IP (you got that when u first started the software on you PC). Add a port number of your choice. This number is kind of the 4 digits next to the zip code. You can choose any number. Make sure the port numbers match on the camera too by checking the cam settings.5-Domnload an app to your phone eg IP cam viwer, and add the camera to it.

The price range has been from the $100 range like this Foscam or personal webcams for video chat to the $800+ range (Axis PTZ). For the price, this camera provides good features and functionality but as many others have mentioned, the instruction manual is very poor. Fortunately, since I work in the tech industry, I am familiar with the operational aspects and had only one problem during configuration - the passwords apparently do not work with non-alphanumeric characters.Be careful when setting/changing passwords or you will need to force a reset (by pushing and holding the reset button on the bottom for 15-30 seconds). My suggestion is to first add a new user, set it to administrative rights, set and then TEST the password. Once you are certain it works, DELETE the default Admin account. Remember that this device if configured for WiFi or remote access, it could easily be found and accessed by others. If you are placing this device in your home, you don't want a digital 'peeping tom' using your camera.The documentation is virtually worthless - a note to Foscam: Please have someone rewrite your manual. This will pay for itself with fewer frustrated and much happier customers and would take less than 1 day. For those that have issues, do a web search. These cameras have been sold for 2+ years and there are a number of postings on configuration/setup.As for concerns with clones/knockoffs. Like others mentioned, I also saw comments on the Foscam.US site about this issue. [...]. They list Foscam.US and many others, including this Amazon vendor as authorized resellers. The device I received appears legit and functions well.Limitations of this device: If used for internal/inside use the quality of the images is average and should be fine for most purposes. The colors are a little muted and it has some issues with shadows when bright sunlight comes through a window into the room. Low-light conditions are also average, but do not think that even with IR it is going to give allow you to 'see in the dark'. For this price that just isn't practical.I have also tried pointing this camera through a window to view the outside. I would rate the picture quality as below average in that the colors are very washed out. Green trees/grass appear brown. Overall color distribution is very poor. The camera has 3 modes 50hz, 60hz and 'Outside'. The one you use depends on the ambient light for your target. Only the outside mode will work when pointing it to an outside target in the daytime.The Pan/Tilt works well - there is NOT a zoom on this camera and if there was, it would only be digital in this price range. Digital zoom isn't really a zoom, its a magnification and the quality with low-rez images (this is a low-rez camera) is very poor. If you need zoom capability, you will need something with an optical zoom, which means several hundred dollars. For more info/details, google/bing digital/optical zoom.Bottom line- for the price, the features and functionality as well as quality is above average.

In researching for my newest buy, I hoped to find some deals since the WVC54GCA is old tech. There were no deals to be had but this camera, Foscam FI8918, was suggested as an alternative. It was about $40 less and had the turn and tilt features so I bought it. I am so glad now that I did.

I use all the features in the camera, the motion detection with picture and web on motion trigger are excellent.  For security purposes, this is nice, since by the time you run up to the camera and unplug it, it has already sent out pictures that were captured when motion was detected.  I was also able to setup the dynamic dns using the free dyndns.org service.  It's nice that the camera has Universal Plug and Play, since the UPnP automatically setup port forwarding on my router.Now, iPhone and Android... this is the best part!

Make sure you properly adjust these settings or you may get a picture that doesn't look so great.  But, don't think that this is because the camera has a bad sensor, as when you adjust the settings, you get excellent video from it, and the colors are nice and vivid.  I repeat, very important, don't neglect to adjust the proper brightness and contrast to get the best picture!For folks worried about setting up wirelessly, some reviews claim to have problems with this, this is how the process goes:You pull this thing out of the package, connect it to your router via the included Ethernet Cable, and you're on your way.  First off, you go to your router page, probably at the default 192.168.1.1 IP address via your web browser.  Then, you login to your router, find out what IP address was assigned to the camera, then enter that IP address into your browser to get to the camera interface.  From here, you just follow the GUI, go over to the Wireless settings, select your wireless SSID, enter your credentials for logging in to the wireless, and its good to go.  Remember that when you switch from Wired to Wireless, the router will assign a different IP address for the wireless mode (there are 2 distinct network interfaces on the camera, with individual MAC addresses, meaning that they are seen as different devices by the router and will therefore get 2 sets of IP addresses).  To continue, you find the camera's wireless IP address, then connect to it via that IP address.

Then I purchased the Foscam camera.  I really expected it to be a low quality camera that would just barely work, but I wanted to try it out and check it off my list of cameras to evaluate.  However, when it arrived and I opened the package, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the device.  The wired installation was too easy and I was able to get it up and running in only a matter of minutes.  (The wired Cisco installation was easy, but not this easy or this fast.)  The pan and tilt operation is absolutely silent and smooth!  (In comparison, the Cisco camera made lots of noise and was a bit jumpy.)  The image quality is very good, though for my purposes I would like a slightly faster frame rate than 30 fps and a slightly higher resolution than 640x480.  As a computer professional, it takes a lot to impress me about computer hardware and related devices.  But I instantly liked the Foscam camera.  Both the geek and the scuba diver in me really like the rubberized black coating, though I don't suppose it really has any functional purpose.  The built-in microphone and speaker are nice touches in addition to the external speaker and microphone jacks, as not all cameras have these.  I also found the mounting screw (a standard camera tripod screw mount) and mounting bracket to be a useful addition.I looked at a lot of cameras and have tried a few brands now, but in my opinion the Foscam holds its own against the others in terms of quality and especially in terms of price.  (The Astak Mole is essentially the same design but for a much higher price than the Foscam.)  For what it does, I give it 5 stars.  Overall, I gave the Foscam camera 4 stars only because I would like to have optical zoom (or digital zoom, for that matter), the higher frame rate, and the higher resolution.  Nevertheless, if the Foscam had zoom in addition to the existing pan and tilt and other features, it would be unbeatable in my opinion.

It has run reliably, and as long as I'm not using the browser interface the IR has stayed on. It's hard to imagine you could do a lot better for the money.REVIEW (updated): This works pretty well. It's a good deal for the money. For most people behind a firewall, or setting up multiple cameras, or not using Windows, it might take a lot of patience to get the most out of it.Pros: 1) Price is good. 2) Pretty easy initial setup for someone who knows computer networking. If you don't then it will be tough to get through a router by following the manual. This would be needed to watch video or control the camera from outside your home local area network. 2) The web UI (user interface) is OK for setting up the camera if you know what you want to accomplish. The menus are better written than the manual. 3) It's easy to get it to send you an email (with 6 still images as attachments) when a motion alarm is triggered. 4) Wireless networking and DHCP just work. 5) Almost all the camera monitoring software companies support this camera or the FI8908. Presets for FI8908 work fine for the FI8918 as far as I can tell. 5) iPhone support comes via several apps. I'm using Surveillance Pro on my iPod Touch and it works fine.Cons: 1) Fair picture quality. At first I thought image quality was _really_ bad, but then I discovered that the focus is adjustable by screwing the lens in or out---even though the manual states \"LENS: CMOS sensor with fixed focus lens.\" 2) The IR illumination turned off upon motion detect with the installed firmware so I only got one illuminated picture followed by 5 dark ones in my night-time email alerts. I installed  firmware update (11.22.2.30 for the system and 2.4.18.15.004 for the UI), which said it fixed this bug in the release notes, but sometimes the IR still turns off when I get a motion alarm. I think it's related to having a non-IE browser hitting the UI when the alarm trips. 3) Safari on the iPhone seems to have issues with the browser UI and does not allow control of pan/tilt, though Safari on my laptop is fine. 4) The web UI only fully functions with Explorer via an ActiveX control you need to install the first time you hit the camera---so no multi-camera support and no sound for Mac OS or linux without 3rd party monitoring software. 5) It's nearly impossible to set up to look through a window at night because you can't push the lens right up against the window to minimize glare. 5) The software comes on a little CD, so you need a tray-loading drive to get at it. You can download the firmware from Foscam's download site. 6) The manual wasn't translated very well but you can understand it most of the time. 7) There is no tech support from US distributor: Here is what they say: \"[we offer] free support for the setup and installation of your wireless IP camera.

I've worked with and around computers and networked devices for many years. I have configured most things on a network that can be configured, and have designed and managed network topology of varying degrees of complexity.In short... I understand how to configure a device on a network.As many other reviewers have pointed out - this little camera is a great camera, it works pretty well, has an above average picture, has a very nice range with the PTZ, is diligent about e-mailing me and alerting me to movement within it's range of vision as I have configured it. It works pretty darn well.However...Configuring it was a daunting task - even for me.As others have pointed out - the supplied instruction manual has microscopic type, and is written in pidgeon Engrish. Not a lot of help.I'd also like to point out that a visit to what I believe may have been the correct website to download a proper set up software and a manual in PDF format resulted in a Trojan drive-by on my hard drive. Be Warned.Know this :If your router at home isn't a wireless router - or you don't have a wireless access point hooked to it - you will have to hard-wire the camera of course. You must first hardwire the camera to your router for initial configuration.You WILL have to poke a very specific pin-hole in your router's firewall at a very specific port. You will then have to make sure traffic to and from this port is properly forwarded. This... is NOT necessarily an easy thing to do. You will need a working knowledge of how this is accomplished - or you can forget about it. You should also be familiar with how to set up a network device on a Static IP. This is because if you lose power and the device boots under DHCP and aquires a different IP address than the one you originally set up - the traffic will no be routed to the proper device. Making it Static means that the device will always have the same address - and therefore traffic will always be properly routed to it.I HAVE a working knowledge of these things - and it STILL took me over 2 hours to carefully work my way to getting the little camera functioning properly. Fair Warning.Then... when I tried to change the default password through the provided web interface - the device fouled and locked me out.

The instruction booklet gives you just the basics in setting up the device. Despite that, I was able to get the camera up and working about 20 minutes after I received it (I'm not an expert by any means but not a complete novice either.)The only problem I had with the camera is that it would disappear from my network every hour or so. I measured the distance between my wireless router and the camera and it was less than 30 feet... probably right at the edge of 27 feet. I use my wireless laptop in the same room all the time without any problems so I thought maybe I installed the camera wrong. I called Foscam Tech Support. The only reason I bought the Amazon fulfilled camera and not the same camera for a cheaper price from a different dealer on Amazon was for the tech support. I wasted my money on this transaction.Foscam tech support is basically an Indian call center. A loud Indian call center where you can hear nearby \"consultants\" carrying on conversations in who knows what language. I sat on hold for 10 minutes (not a bad wait for late afternoon) to get some lady with a thick, but understandable accent. I briefly described my problem assuming she would ask whatever follow-up questions she needed to be able to help me - you know, like at any other tech support center in the US. Instead, she tells me to log into my computer and go to a website where I give her a code and she can take control of my computer. I've done something similar with Dell support and I called the tech number from the FOSCAM website so I consented. Rather than ask more questions, she goes through the exact same steps that are provided in the booklet. She keeps clicking and checking ports and finally - since she wouldn't talk to me throughout the process or ask any questions - I tell her the reason why the port is still closed... I have 2 routers (one for the DSL and one for the wireless). One would think she would ask how my network was setup but whatever.... She continues doing the same thing. I'm watching all this and would have to periodically get up and unplug the camera as she requested. Over an hour later, once she got to the end I saw the error sign on the settings page for the camera's website but she concluded that everything was finished and should work properly. I knew darn well it wasn't but I was so tired of her wasting my time that I just said thank you and was about to hang up. Before I hang up the agent asks if I can do a survey on her performance. I say yes thinking it would be a phone survey. Instead, she controls my computer to go to Amazon.com, asks me to log into my account, finds the product page, clicks write a review and then instructs me to click on either the 4 star or 5 star and start typing. My jaw dropped. I have never, ever, ever had a company basically strong arm a favorable review on an Amazon page. I told her I don't have time for this and I disconnected the call. I suspect the 5 star, 2 line reviews for this product are from customers who basically had to perform a shot-gun review of tech support while still under the control of the agent.I'll give a 5 star review for the product ....for now .... but Tech Support gets a 0. I had to redo everything that agent messed up on my computer (the Foscam website forum is tons more helpful than its tech support line). I made sure to change the ports - just in case. Everything is working perfectly now. The camera stays online all the time. I can view and control the camera remotely from the website link. The picture is pretty clear - clearer than I thought it should be for the price - and the microphone picks up everything. I thought I'd have to buy a separate one but it is very sensitive. I haven't set up email alarm alerts since I'm not using it for that purpose. What was the camera disconnecting? I needed to move the wireless router a little closer to the camera. It's now in the center of the house so the camera is about 18-20 feet away. I had to upgrade an old computer to make it wireless but that just cost about $10 and 10 minutes. I should have tried that first than calling tech support. Hindsight is 20/20.Moral of the story - Buy from whomever sells the camera the cheapest and go to the FOSCAM website support forum if you have any questions or issues. You'll get better advice from other FOSCAM owners than whoever FOCSAM has working the phones in Madras or wherever tech support is located.I'll update if I have any problems with the camera but it is meeting expectations at the moment.P.S. A day after I contacted tech support, I began receiving phone calls from some Indian guy telling me to go to my computer and log on because there is erratic activity coming from my computer. I know it's a scam because the person won't identify himself and if you ask what company he is working for he gives you a very generic name like PC Support. Don't know if they are connected with FOSCAM or if FOSCAM sells your phone number after you call tech support but I find it very coincidental. I'm giving FOSCAM the benefit of the doubt that they aren't involved but if others have experienced the same thing shortly after calling tech support I'll change the review to say \"Stay Away!\"", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best IP Camera for the Price", "Author": "vardelda", "ReviewID": "R2WMKZPYMNJL6P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you think you are buying a high quality, easy to setup, well documented, well supported camera for this price -- you will be unhappy!

Sound and outgoing audio are rather poor but I hardly use those features.  Where Foscam severely disappoints is in warranty support.  You will find that the one year warranty for these cameras indicates it applies only to cameras purchased directly through their website (ie: buy it through a reseller and they have no warranty).  Additionally, one of the power supplies for one of my cameras failed after three months and Foscam told me that the warranty applied only to the cameras (not to the power supply that comes with them in the same box....) and despite the fact that they sell the power supplies seperately on their website and advertise them as being covered by a one year warranty.....

The web interface is not good.  It requires an ActiveX control for full functionality, and to make matters worse the signed cert on the control expires a month or two ago, and now to get it to work on new machines, I have to set the clock back, install the control, then set it forward.  That is probably a deal breaker for many, and should be.  Searches online for the issue yielded such helpful bits as a Turkish distributor complaining about the problem and the manufacturer response to set the clock back.  I've bought 9 of these so far, and one did not work.  The other 8 worked, excepting the problem above and that one of them would reboot if you attempted to pan/tilt it - there was some goofy fix for it involving doing something during the startup calibration process, but I forgot what it was - after it was done though, it worked as expected.  The interface for configuring e-mail alerts is terrible, requiring literally hundreds of clicks for each camera to individually click on and off each hour that you want or don't want motion monitored.  The alerts can only send a series of 6 snap shots, no more, and no video (this can be remedied by purchasing dedicated controller/DVR software to run on a server). Despite all of that, I'd probably still recommend them.  For the number I needed, I would have paid at least $1000-$2000 more for another camera with PTZ capability and wireless.  Once I learned the quirks, they were fast to set up and deploy.  I don't have any complaints about the image quality, and when I connect them to a controller, iPhone, or Android app, they work as expected.  They also have two-way microphone capability and night vision - very well equipped for the price.  So, if you have a high tolerance for poorly made and supported software, the hardware capabilities of the camera are a good value for the price - especially when using them with 3rd party apps and not their own web interface.  Oh yeah - one last note regarding poorly supported - the manufacturer offers no warranty or return policy, asking you to work the the reseller, I bought it form some random Amazon 3rd party vendor who did nothing after 30 days, and I didn't get around to opening one of the batches until that had already passed, so I am stuck with the one dead unit.

This allowed me to not have to remember the IP address that my ISP assigns me.

Oh sure you can go buy some additional software to try and figure out how to integrate the two but show me one person who successfully did that who doesn't have an IT degree.(I got an IT person and the results are BELOW)Basically I have far better results running Skype with a $20 webcam; better picture, smoother streaming, better sound.... I think it's time these guys or SOMEONE came out with a product that is not outdated by 10 years, my smartphone can record video, with effects, with motion detection and all wirelessly with ZERO effort or technical B.S., so why can't this camera do it better, when that is it's ONE AND ONLY function?Bottom line, if you're gonna get one call your IT friend to help you and maybe just mount it over your front door so you can check in to see if you have UPS packages at your door... of course that's what tracking is for... it's not like you will be able to record the neighbor stealing it off your porch.UPDATE:So a week or so later and after many conversations with the most knowledgeable people I can find, and the result is this:You CAN record, but only locally (to a computer plugged into the same network that your camera is on) which makes it normally inaccessible to you when you're not home not to mention your evidence videos are on-site waiting for your would-be thief to steal.You CAN have it upload to a different place, via FTP or even email but only SNAPSHOTS which usually capture the picture way too late (a motion sets an alarm then it takes a moment to record a picture.You can set the interval which it will continue to snap pictures, which can become overwhelming if you have your camera outdoors, near a breeze, the sun, shadows etc...) I set mine at my front door and it uploaded 8000 photos of nothing except a leaf blowing in the wind.Then I set the sensitivity lower and it just took that much longer for it to recognize a movement, you won't catch someone walking by or even dropping off something unless the person is milling around in front of the camera for a while. You will have however a 45 minute video of the scene after they left.... and snapshots too... not helpful. The alternative is turning up the sensitivity but this resulted in the 8000 photos I mentioned and of course 17GB of videos 45 minutes long each filling my hard drive.To those of you who have the skills and software and know-how to fiddle with these things, that's great, you can probably build a cyber network through a proxy and VPN to your home network to make all your dreams come true with this camera..

My biggest problem with it, so far, is the inability to flip/mirror the image from a PC browser, when the camera is mounted upside down, hanging from the ceiling. The camera just crashes (I tried three different browsers) and once it reboots, the image is still upside down. It seems to be an issue with this particular model, as there are recent posts on Foscam's website support forum about this, from a few other users. The only thing that kept me from returning it so far, hoping for a quick manufacturer firmware update that would fix the problem, is the fact that I can flip the image from a smart phone app (but that only flips it for that app). The flip from the PC browser is supposed to do it for all other devices you would access the camera from, if working correctly, but since it does not, it makes viewing the camera from a PC, in the ceiling, upside-down installations, impossible.So, if you do need to mount it on a ceiling and monitor it from a PC, you are going to have a problem. If you are only going to watch it from a smart phone, you should be OK.If the manufacturer releases a firmware update fixing this problem, the camera will be a great deal for the money, but until then, I can't give it more than 2 stars.UPDATE: Change rating to 4 stars. After insisting with requesting help from the manufacturer, I was finally emailed a firmware fix and I am able to flip/mirror the image.

For some reason I just felt better about keeping an eye on the place. This camera performed up to my expectations. First of all, the set up I would rate as \"moderately\" advanced. It took me a few hours to get set up, and it DOES involve port forwarding, so some IP knowledge would come in handy. I had minimal experience with this.. but have worked in IT in the past, so I got it going. There are some additional expenses that you need to plan for.. first, my internet provider charges $5 a month for a static IP. I would totally recommend getting a static IP if you can't check on the camera every day. Before the trip I had about 3 weeks to work out the kinks in the camera. The IP changed on me one day and it was kind of a bummer to not be able to view the camera while I was at work. With the static IP, this problem was solved.Another problem that I found with this camera is that it will on occasion freeze up. This, again, happened while I was at work. It requires you to unplug the camera (power cycle) and then it comes back online with no problems. Of course this was unacceptable for when I am thousands of miles away. I came up with an idea.. I have the camera on a common household timer, it goes down 2 times a day.. effectively power cycling it. This way.. if the cam was down I know that it will be back up in a few hours and I won't be SOL.Overall I really like this camera.. night vision is awesome.. the pan/tilt is great. Yeah, the manual is written in \"chinglish\".. but you can get the gist of what they are talking about.One thing I REALLY like about this camera is you can set up an alarm if it detects motion.

Had it about a month now and it has proved very reliable.  I mostly view the camera via an iPad app (there are free apps... but I used a paid app that supports audio).

The PC version is a little more difficult to configure the audio side of things as that relies upon some third party (free plugin) for that to function.

Depending on your expertise that may be an issue.Only gripe is the audio quaility is very poor.  This appears to be a known issue (one that is \"mentioned\" on various internet posts).

First I'll start with a general review of the camera itself though, from a techie standpoint.Overall the camera is quite nice.  It is a bit bulky and so is noticeable when mounted somewhere.  It has a good range of motion and the IR lights are a nice touch.  Access to the device is primarily via the web interface, which includes changing the settings of the camera as well as viewing a live feed and controlling the pan/tilt.  There is no zoom on this camera that I can see.You can also access stored information about the camera via cgi calls to its web server.  So you can set and get specific parameters once you know the right web call.  This makes for excellent access via external applications, which I cover a bit later.The quality of the video is mediocre.  The lens has a twistable ring for focus, but that must be done manually.  So try to set the focus before mounting it way up high.  otherwise you'll need to use the live view on a laptop or something so you can fine tune the focus.  The ring is hard to twist so expect to use both hands (one to brace the device, another to twist).  Once focused things still are quite grainy.  If I had to try to identify anyone in the video I doubt I could unless they were within a few feet of the camera - otherwise the image is too grainy/low quality.  It is good enough to see what is going on in the video though.I have found that once a day or two the video will \"glitch\" for a frame or two, which fires off a motion detection alert.  I also see it spontaneously reboot once a week or so.  No real harm in these things though, and I assume further firmware changes might resolve these issues.The web interface is totally geared to Internet Explorer as it uses an ActiveX component.  Recent firmware upgrades (that were already installed on my shipped device) allow other browsers to login and see live video via a \"push mode\" - not sure why they named it that.  So Firefox users can login and view live video, and access all the settings (almost).  The ability to set saved camera positions isn't easily accessed as some of the buttons and widgets are not totally visible on the screen in Firefox.I tested the email alert functionality, and found it fairly useless.  I spoke with Foscam support (who were quite responsive to my various queries both via email and phone) and the end result is that the email will contain a number of relevant snapshots (4-6 in my experiments) and they are taken at the beginning of the alert sequence.  So typically they were useless as the first second of an alert doesn't tell me anything about what actually happened during the motion detection.  I have disabled that functionality.I tested the FTP upload functionality and that works too.  However it doesn't upload anything other than a series of snapshots of the images - static pictures.  I'm not sure how it decides how many pictures to save but it drops lots of pictures in a single FTP folder.  I don't believe it has the ability to create subfolders to organize the images.I spoke with Foscam support about figuring out how to save video of a motion alert, and the only way to do that is to have an open browser window with the ActiveX component running.  That ActiveX component can be set up to save video to the local computer's drives.  Without ActiveX, there is no way to save video from this camera, and saving images doesn't really produce useful motion alert documentation.Foscam suggested a few 3rd party software solutions that could save video - none of them work on Linux.  Most require purchasing.At this point Foscam invited me to send an email to their engineering dept to express a desire to get the camera working without relying on ActiveX.  I never heard back (over a month ago).  So I'm not holding my breath.But I did end up keeping the camera because there is one bright spot in this story: Zoneminder.  This open source camera monitoring application runs on Linux and I was able to use their documentation to setup the camera to work for motion detection as well as control via the Zoneminder web interface.  I haven't been able to get motion tracking to work though.  Zoneminder monitors the camera's video feed remotely and analyzes the images looking for motion detection.  So basically I am using Zoneminder to do everything, and have turned off motion detection in the camera.  Zoneminder has some seriously awesome functionality - if you're looking for security camera software you should check it out.  This camera though is basically working as an IP webcam with pan/zoom - so watch the price of the camera as there may be cheaper options out there if you want to use Linux.There are also some nice 3rd party apps out there for iOS (iPod/iPhone/iPad) as well as Android that allow you to view the camera's feed and manipulate the pan/zoom.I wasn't able to get anything working with the audio in Linux.  I think one of the Android apps worked with it though - I haven't investigated it further yet.Overall I am somewhat happy with the camera, but only because of Zoneminder.  I would have returned it otherwise.  The resolution of the camera is mediocre so don't buy if you're expecting serious monitoring.  I have uploaded a still image captured from the Foscam web interface during the day, and I have uploaded a video export from Zoneminder of the results of a night incursion from some masked marauders.

So you need to get in to the router to find it. There is a lot of that type thing so if your uncomfortable with the terms like DDNS, Static IP, port forwarding, leave this alone or plan to spent several hours learning.But once you work through it's a nice working camera. I use this camera with a MacBook running Firefox so only the basic CGI controls are supplied. Others talk of the nice Active X IE stuff but not on Mac OS X. The audio doesn't work in Firefox, requiring a plug-in I haven't found yet.There is a cool plug in for Firefox that puts the controls in the right side of the address bar and displays the video stream in the sidebar, search for IP PTZ in add-ons.The Quick Installation Guide is a joke. It points in the right direction but... I did find an CGI SDK that works with this but I think it's old since things like MSN are not in it but the basic commands are the same. And it shows the same quality of documentation as it doesn't state which models it covers.As to video quality, colors are not great. A dark blue wall appear gray, yellow tree leaves are muted.In a quite room the motor can be heard.I've only had this a few days so no idea as to reliability.Overall good enough that I'm getting another to see how multiple cameras will work.UDATE 4/15/12I had three of these cameras at an unheated house from Nov 2011 until March 2012. Min inside temp was 22degF They worked great but the one camera I had looking out of a window got constant motion triggers on partially cloudy days. This was with motion sense set at 8 which allowed it to see a car, which it did, but not trigger on a person. I wish Foscam sold a 3x optical zoom version and would add area select boxes for motion triggers. Also still no audio suport on Mac. They tell you to use a VLC plug-in but thats a frustrating bad joke. But overall still happy with them and will be buying a few more.Also I've now had these cameras on constantly since Nov 2011.

Lionel", "ReviewID": "R3IY4V7RVBPBID", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I have a small second home, and there have been many times we've driven out to it to check on it for possible trouble.  While we do have a monitored alarm system, I often found that I wished I was able to see what was going on and started to look at options for network cameras.  I was about to buy a different, more expensive one, when I noted this Foscam camera in the Amazon list of products others had viewed, so I checked it out.  I liked what I saw so I bought it, and am glad I did.The Foscam camera set up easily - I tried it both wirelessly and wired, and ended up using a wired connection because it was available, but I did test the wireless with WPA2-AES encryption.  The initial tool you use for finding the camera on the network is a bit odd and I had trouble getting it to set the DHCP mode on the camera, where it would get an IP address from the router, but once I got to the camera's own settings page that was easy.The instruction booklet that comes with the Foscam camera is tiny and the text is nearly unreadable.  Throw that out and read the PDF that's on the CD with the software.I was delighted to see such features as:- Automatic updating of a dynamic DNS provider (I use DynDNS)- Motion detection (though I'm still experimenting with this)- Ability to email and FTP imagesThere are two web interfaces, one that uses an ActiveX control and is for Internet Explorer only, and one that works with other browsers such as Firefox.  I found that some of the options described in the manual are only in the ActiveX version.The image from the camera is quite clear, though the colors are a bit off (no big deal).  I like that you can turn the IR LEDs on and off - with them on, I can see room details up to about 10 feet away.  You can even turn off the network status light on the back for a more \"stealthy\" installation.  One thing I noted was that the camera seemed to run fairly warm, and gave off a smell reminiscent of hot electronics.  This appears to come from having the IR LEDs on - when turned off, the camera feels cooler and the odor faded.  The camera swivels through about 270 degrees horizontally, and over at least a 90 degree range vertically.The one problem I had was not the camera's fault.  When I tested it locally, I had no trouble accessing the camera from the \"outside\" IP address (I set up port forwarding on my router and reserved the camera a fixed IP on my LAN).  But when I left and tried to access it remotely, I could not connect.  I eventually realized that the ISP for my DSL service there blocks inbound connects to TCP port 80 (HTTP).  When I changed the port number on the camera to a different one (for example, 8001), it worked fine.  (If you do this, you add the port number following a colon after the hostname. I'd show you an example, but Amazon's review filter would remove it...)  You can even have the camera send you an email with its IP address (and port!) when it powers up or it detects an external IP address change.I also have an iPhone and iPad and found there are quite a few apps for viewing Foscam images.  The one I settled on is called Foscam Surveillance Pro.  It seems the most well-rounded and actively maintained, and it works well for me.  It even lets you select among multiple cameras, if you have them, turn panning on and off, and more.  None of these seem to provide audio, though.Lastly, I was amused/delighted to find a Chinese papercut decoration packed in with the camera, with text indicating that putting it in a window would help bring luck to the home.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great if use are not planning to use the audio", "Author": "Jack", "ReviewID": "R3T2YH25B3GH2T", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The good: Great interface, night vision and video quality for the price.

Beware IP address changes once in a while so you have to adjust for that or use one one of the forwarding IP address company.", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing with the iPhone", "Author": "Dr.Kevin", "ReviewID": "R1436KSX7KYG8P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had read some other reviews and had seen the over-all good ratings.  I bought two cameras, planning to buy more if these worked well.  Set-up was a little tricky, but not too bad.  I could see my cameras on my home computers, but could not figure out how to see using a web browser outside my home.  The solution was two-fold.  First, I had to get into my router settings and set up port-forwarding for each of the cameras.  You can use the IP Camera Software to set the port first.  I chose ports 8080 and 8081, then went into the routher settings to port forward.  I learned how to do forward the ports by watching a few YouTube videos.  The second part was to determine my network's IP address.  I Googled \"what is my IP address\" and quickly found my answer.  Then, all I had to do was to go to an inernet browser and type in my home IP address, followed by a colon, then followed by the port for each camera (8080 or 8081).  Bingo.  Next I installed a program called \"Foscam Surveillance Pro\" on my iPhone (4th Gen).  The program was very easy to set up.  Now my wife and I can check on our house from anywhere with amazing clarity.  We can turn the cameras around and look around the house.  The infared lights are powerful enough to light up even a large room.  I put my second camera in a garage window to watch the street and front of the house.  It works great in the daytime, but cannot be used at night because our street is so dard.  If I turn the infareds on, they just reflect back into the camera.  I knew it would do this when I bouth it, so I was not disappointed.  Sometimes, there's a small lag, but so far not an issue.  There's also no sound, but I did not buy the units expecting to use sound.  I am very satisfied with the picture quality and our friends are amazed as well.  One down-side to the iPhone application is that most homes have an external IP address that changes frequently based on network conditions (Dynamic).  Our IP address stays constant for days or weeks at a time but sometimes changes.  When this happens we simply have to update the IP address in the iPhone application, then everything works fine again.  If it becomes too much of a problem, I have the option to pay $5 a month for an IP address that never changes (Static).  For roughly $200 plus a $5 iPhone App, I have the coolest toy and home camera system.  My wife loves it and I do too.  I am very glad I bought these cameras, and plan on buying a few more for inside the house, and a couple outside IP cameras.  Good luck.", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Functionally works fine via ethernet, but the directions are terrible, wifi is a joke, and I couldn't ever set it up.", "Author": "BT \"Big Papi\"", "ReviewID": "R1F9J1MJJHJYGP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this in order to set up a \"nanny-cam\" in my house.

The wired connection worked alright.- No customer setup support is available.Overall, if you feel confidentin setting up port forwarding and you have a CAT5wired house or happen to have ethernet ports where you want this, then go for it.

The screen froze every few minutes because of interference.  I live in San Francisco, so we can see like 10 other 2.4ghz routers from our house. video baby monitors are also on 2.4ghz (go figure FCC?!)so most, if not all baby video monitors either don't work, or cause interference with your WIFI.  So, I decided to try the Foscam.  It works great.  I have it hard wired (ethernet) rather than wireless, just to minimize the chances for interference.  We can view it on our computers or our iphones, which is great.  The remote control even works from the iphone, although the interface is not that great on the iphone.  We use it in conjuction with a Phillips AVENT SCD535 sound monitor, which also has no interference (baby sound monitors are on 1.9ghz, plus this one has 250 channels it can cycle through to find one with no interference)Together, this combination gives us ZERO interference with our baby monitor needs.  There is one downside, I have spend several hours trying to establish an IP address so I can view this on my iphone from anywhere, but can't seem to do it. I can only see the webcam if I'm home and on the network.  I'm not a network guy, but I'm pretty good with tech stuff.

Setting up the camera for remote viewing took a lot of work.  I did countless internet searches and read many forums before figuring it out. Only stubborness prevented me from giving up.  In total I estimate it took 15 hours of effort over 3 days to finally figure everything out.Second, changes in light will trigger the motion sensor alarm.

I had received a Summer Infant Day & Night Flat Screen Color Video Monitor with 7\" LCD Screen as a baby shower gift.  It was great - until the monitor crapped out after 1 year.  At first it wouldn't stay on, eventually it wouldn't TURN on.  Called the company, out of warranty after a year, and can't buy a replacement monitor - just an additional camera.  I was not about to shell out $200, so we made due with a second hand sound-only monitor.  That was until a month ago when my son climbed out of the crib and surprised me in the kitchen!!  We needed a video monitor asap - he was still not ready for a toddler bed and I need to see him in case he tries it again.I did what I always do, and I researched for hours on Amazon to see what the best option was.  I did not want to buy another Summer Infant product, and I did not want to spend over $100.  I came across this surveillance camera, and read the reviews.  I'm pretty handy, and know my way around computers well enough that I thought I could hook it up.  It was very simple to set up, and we were up and running in about a half hour (including mounting it to the wall).  My husband and I both have iPhones (3GS) so I downloaded the free cam viewer app to use as the monitor.  We still have our sound monitor going, so if we hear any crying or activity, we just check the app and we can see him.  We can even move the camera from the app!  It's awesome!  I haven't figured out the settings enough so that we can see the camera when we are not on our wifi network, but it's mainly b/c I haven't had the time.  I would love to send the hubby a text saying \"going down for a nap now\" and he could check his phone and my son can wave to the camera to say \"night night\" to daddy while he is at work.  I also want to use that for when we leave him with the babysitter, so I can monitor them.  I'm considering buying another to use in the playroom for when I need to step into another room or use the bathroom.Overall we are extremely happy with it.  One cool thing with the iPhone app, the screen will not turn off if you are viewing the camera, so you can have constant visual if you want.  Of course, you would want your phone charging at the same time as not to waste the battery.Also, way safer than traditional baby monitors too.  Since those all use the same frequency, if you live in an apt complex, you can pick up other peoples feed.  And there is that urban legend (really true though) that someone can drive around a neighborhood with a monitor and pick up the feed from homes as they drive by.  That's too creepy for me!I know we will use this after he's too old for a monitor as a regular surveillance camera too.

I won't bore you with that.  I have played with it for a day now. Here are my impressions that others perhaps have not talked about too much.- The setup is straight forward if you are familiar w/ home network.  Took me less than an hour to have wireless and DynDNS, my iPad and Droid X all set up to go.  By the way, IP Camera View (paid version) is well worth the money for both Android and iPad.- The viewing angle is narrow.  You'd have to back up quite a bit to get a decent view.  But then the limited resolution works against you there.  Plus, a normal size room would not be long enough for you to back away.- The range of panning is quite good.  Almost 360 except for directly behind. However, panning speed (in spite of the improvement from previous version) is painfully slow.  It takes 2 minutes to pan from one end to the other.  That's slower than watch the second hand sweep across the clock!- Software is limited and buggy.  Only IE with Active X will give you full functionality.  Firefox and Chrome will work but without audio and preset positions.  I'll upload a few screen shots soon.  This not only means non-IE browsers wont get sound, any iPad application will not have sound for you either!  (EDIT: Actually, on the IE window there are no way to receive and transmit sound?!  Am I missing it somewhere?  Someone please tell me otherwise!)- Power chord is only 4 feet or so.  Practically useless for any sort of installation except putting it on a table top.  If I keep this unit, I'll have to rig together an extension for it so I can keep the \"brick\" plug (similar to that of a cell phone charger) away from the visible wall.- Oh, the BIGGEST COMPLAINT I have so far, is that exposure is not automated.  In day light, the sun on the wall and light color furniture blinds out the image.  Your alert snapshots will be useless since you were likely not there to adjust the brightness and contrast for the changing lighting condition throughout the day.  Same thing with IR at night.  You think you have it adjusted nicely, the moment a pet or person comes into view or in front of the camera, it overexposes on the IR and you don't see any details at all.  This is useless as an automated monitor system!!!  I may end up returning it just for this reason alone!- The position presets do not work.  The IE admin panel that sets these simply do not do it.  Is it too much to expect a subsequent software update to fix this?  Dunno.  (EDIT2: this works now with a new unit.)- You cannot put it in \"patrol mode\" to pan/tilt randomly and then expect to take over control if you see something.  For that, you'd have to change the setting which reboots the camera in 30 seconds, and then be able to take over the movement control.  That's just dumb!!I have not decided to keep this or not.  Will update this post when I do.EDIT: I am returning it.  The low quality picture and the non-self-adjusting brightness/contrast really kills it for me.EDIT2: It turns out the unit I got might have been defective.  I got another one and a few things improved: preset works now, panning speed seems faster now.", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "My experience with Foscam FI8918W", "Author": "Billz", "ReviewID": "R1IOGRL1T7DB8H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm still unsure as to how to rate this camera. I ordered my first Foscam FI8918W camera and it arrived overnight. I specifically followed the instructions as outlined in the Installation Manual. After hours of trying to get the camera to work, NO LUCK. The first problem was the installation disk that came in the package was cracked and I couldn't install the necessary software with this broken disk. So, I searched online and found the necessary software on a Foscam Camera Dealer's website. I downloaded the software and attempted to setup my new camera. Again, I followed the instructions, step by step with no luck. I finally realized that the camera I received must have been someone else's return. I believe this because the installation disk was cracked and the camera already had someone else's password established on it. I never could get a picture from the camera and after hours of unsuccessful attempts, I gave up and returned the camera.Next, I ordered another Foscam FI8918W camera, as the Amazon.com website would not allow me to simply exchange the first camera. The second camera arrived the next day. The second camera seemed to be loose in the base and something seemed to be rattling around inside the base. Again, I attempted to install the camera and software. This time, I was successful with getting the camera connected to my LAN. After many issues with getting the camera to connect to my router, finally I was successful. I had to disable WPA2 security on the router, as the camera wouldn't connect to my network with WPA2 enabled. I could only get the camera to connect using the WEP security on the router. Finally, after hours of \"trial and error\" I have the camera connected to my household wireless. It can be viewed on any PC in the house that's connected to my home network, but after all the aggravation, I'm not yet ready to try to connect to the camera remotely through the internet. I will save that task for another time.As stated in other reviews, the instructions are written in poor and improper English. You need to have plenty of patience to install this camera. I don't recommend it if you have very little, to no experience with computers or setting up routers.In conclusion, this camera is currently doing fifty-percent of what I intended it to do. I purchased it to monitor the exterior of my house while I'm at home and away. I can only view the camera when I'm at home, currently. Once you do establish a connection, the features are good. The pan and tilt functions work better than I expected and the infrared night vision is excellent. It can view an area in total darkness with the infrared feature enabled. There isn't really a zoom feature on this camera but you can view a relatively wide area quite easily without using the pan or tilt functions. All in all, I guess you get what you pay for. For the price, this is not a totally bad value if you have a little time and patience for setting this unit up.", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera especially for the price!!", "Author": "J.

If you have set-up your our wireless network at home, you can add this camera.  Don't get fooled by the difficulties shared by other users.  Try it and if it's not working, return it!Pros:  Great picture!  Auto adjusting for brightness works great and the infrared night vision works great too!  Nice feature that you can turn off the blinking network signal lights on the back so it's not constantly blinking at night!  Remote access (I use Firefox or Safari) works well - remote pan/tilt is great, brightness control, etc.  Easy set-up via network cable then place the camera anywhere within range of your network (and a power plug) and you're good to go.  Love keeping an eye on my little one on my iPhone when I have to go in the other room!Cons:  f you run Firefox you will not get Audio.  Audio (as I've researched) only works with IE and no, the old version available for Mac doesn't support it either.

He was very patient and answered every single question I had for him. He was able to remote to my computer and pretty much it was on cruise mode from there. He did everything! He setup my remote access and showed me how I can access it on my phone and also what app to download on my android phone. A++ for this guy!!! Foscam, you really do have a employee who is dedicated and really wants to improve customer relations.I've purchased many computer related equipment and not one company provides this type of technical service. I also like to mention that when I called the tech support number I was put on hold for no more than 3-4 minutes. Not bad!!! I've had other companies I dealt with and they'll be putting me on hold for 10-15 mins and then their tech support people think I'm doing something wrong.From the very beginning, Ryan was very nice and professional. And this is why I give 5 thumbs up! As for how well the camera works? We'll see. Today is my first day using it. I got motion detection turned on when I'm away from the house. Ryan showed me how to manually change the schedule. This company really rocks when it comes to customer service!!!!Thanks again Ryan!! I plan to buy 2 more for my house and another 2 for my parents. And my reason is because of the customer service.

It's the same story on an iPad with a dedicated app and on windows and mac.I would tend to think that maybe it's the fault of some other piece of hardware on my network, and I have tried even running a cable directly from a laptop to it.  Same horrible story.After much playing with it, I am able to get a more stable, but not perfect, connection by turning down the framerate and setting it to run in 320x240 mode, which I should NOT have to do.

Second one, at a different location, not so great.  Why you ask?

Easy initial setup, very good quality clear picture/sound and extremely good IR night vision.  The pan/tilt function is easy and smooth.This is my first W-Fi camera but I do have 2 Zmodo DVR(s) with 4 wired cameras attached to each of them.  They are both attached to my router via Ethernet cables so I've had to deal with port forwarding and various camera software packages on both Windows and Android platforms before.Setup is very simple: screw the antenna on, plug the camera into the power adapter, plug the supplied Ethernet cable into the camera & your router and place the CD in your computer/open it up.  It doesn't have an auto start program - open the readme.txt file.  It instructs you to select one of the first 3 folders depending on your system Win XP, Win 7 or Apple.  Click on the appropriate (or closest version) and click on setup.  The program will install \"IP Tool\".When the installation is finished click on \"IP Tool\", it will bring up a box with an \"TEMPORARY\" IP address, click on it and follow the rest of the screens/instructions till you have your camera working.Next you need to set it up for wireless, the easiest way is to hit the WPS button on your router and on the camera to automatically sync them up.  On the camera bottom there is a little pin hole - use a paper clip or tooth pick and hold it down for 4 seconds. That will sync them up.This is were I ran into the first issue NOT covered in the manual.  When the camera sync(s) up with the router it is assigned a new \"permanent\" IP address.  You need to know what that is.  For what ever reason the \"IP Tool\" would not display it initially.  To find it I logged onto my router and displayed history.  That showed the assigned (local) IP address.I took the camera to the other side of my house and plugged it in the wall.  I opened my browser and typed in the IP address and the camera came right up and worked great.On the CD in another folder is the Foscam camera program that has more features and options than the built in program on the camera.  I loaded the Windows 7 version on my Windows 8 64-bit computer but could get it to work at all.  I tried all the tricks, running it in Windows 7 & XP Mode as well as administrator.  It just starts sits a few seconds and ends - period.I loaded it on my Windows 7 notebook.  The program does start but never will recognize the camera after I input the correct settings.  I went to Focam's website.  There were now newer versions of this program.  I checked for firmware updates, after playing their games of registering, confirming the registration, the emailed me a list of firmware.  Mine was up to date - BUT IF you ever update your firmware NOTE: camera version warnings or you could kill your camera.There are plenty of other free or cheap camera software programs out there if you are running multiple cameras and need a program.  IF this is your only camera, the built in camera program accessed by typing the IP address is probably fine.On my Android tablet I just opened Google Chrome and typed the IP address and the camera came up BUT without full pan/tilt function.  I loaded the free Foscam program from the Google store but again it would not recognize my camera.  I already had \"IP Cam Viewer Lite\" another free app from the Google store.  I use that to view my other cameras.  I added the new Foscam camera to it (it has a large database of cameras to include this one) and it came right up.  It had all the pan/tilt functions but NOT sound.  That requires the full version that costs a couple of buck.I give the camera its self 5 Stars - it is a great camera!  The Foscam software is pretty bad, luckily there are others out there.  PLUS Foscam will NOT provide any technical assistance if you call/email.  There website clearly states that they will only do so for items bought directly from them - NOT Amazon or Ebay!  I never heard that one before - pretty weak.  Also of note that there is a new model of this camera - same number but with the addition of \"IR\" at the end.  Maybe why these are so cheap - to clear out the old stock.I purchased mine by clicking on the \"Buy Used and Save\" that you see on several of \"Sold by Amazon\" listing which have returns or open/damaged boxes.

This device has it all if you understand port forwarding. If you don't, a quick google search for \"port forwarding (your router brand here)\" will solve the problem.Where to begin! The camera is wireless (with the exception of the power cord), and getting it to connect to your wireless network is a piece of cake with the included software. Heck, you can even wire it directly into your router if you want to, since it has a LAN port. From there, you can access the camera from *any* computer (even your phone!), where you can rotate the display, turn on motion detection, email photos to yourself, or upload to a remote server. It also has a built-in web server, so you don't need your home computer to be on to use it. Simply leave your internet turned on, and the camera will do its job. Oh, did I mention it has an infrared mode? Leave the lights off at home, too! The camera sees just as well in the dark. When I'm away, I have motion detection turned on and set the camera to send me an email with the photos (and upload them to my website) whenever it is triggered. Instant notification if anything is amiss!So, why is this camera priced well below packages from more well-known brands? The difficulty is that you need to be able to forward a particular port through your router so that you can access the camera from outside your local network.

There is the slightest of delays in the video, and the refresh rate is not absolutely smooth. But for use as a baby cam, or pet cam or even intruder cam, this works just fine.I really like being able to operate the pan and tilt remotely, and the night vision works much better than I'd expected. It basically shows a black and white view that's quite clear. It's also pretty easy to set up the camera to emai lyou when it detects motion. You can also ask it to send you snapshots when it detects motion.The audio is terrible! Some people have suggested removing the wifi antenna. That helped a little, but with and without the antenna, the crackling static makes the audio unusable. You can connect your own microphone and speaker to the unit, I haven;t tried that yet.Setting up the camera to view the video remotely was easy within my network. But it took a bit of messing around to get to view it from outside my network, using an external ip address. For what it's worth, my mistake was to set port forwarding while connected to the router wirelessly. The port forwarding worked once I connected to the router via ethernet.I've had this camera for a few weeks, I'm hoping it lasts a couple of years, but we'll see.

If you plan to say mount one to hang from a ceiling indoors, you'll need to either have access to a household power outlet up there, or maybe extend the wire so that you could run it from the AC adapter plugged somewhere in the home and run through the wall up to the camera (if you do this yourself, remember that you'll need to compensate for the fact that power decreases the longer the wire is; you might want to consult an electrician and even have them do the job for you so that you ensure enough power gets to the camera and that the work meets applicable building codes). Even simpler (if you have a light socket in the attic) might be to get a device that has both a light socket and power outlets that you can screw into the socket, then run an extension cord to the camera's AC adapter.The camera can be used outdoors at night well enough if you mount it say under an eave of your roof, but using it outdoors during the day sucks. Although the resolution is pretty good, this camera lacks the \"IR cut\" feature of other models (this feature will automagically drop an IR filter over the lens in the daytime to block IR light), as a result daytime images are largely black and white and somewhat washed out. Indoors though it works nicely, and the camera has a photoresistor which can be configured to turn on the IR LEDs when the light level gets low enough (though the threshold doesn't seem to be configurable.The web interface looks like something out of the early 1990s. It's usable but nowhere near up to accepted web standards for usability and whatnot. Setup is fairly straightforward with wizard-style prompts guiding you in broken English. You can have the camera send you snapshots via email and FTP, and also set it up to be accessible from the public internet. For this there is a live video web page which lets you pan and scan and configure the image quality.It would be a good idea to set the camera up with a UPS, so that if a brownout or blackout occurs the camera will remain online. Also there's a setting which tells the camera to reposition itself on startup; I'd recommend disabling this, otherwise if power does happen to go out (whether because the home's power goes out or the camera for some reason locks up or decides to reboot), the reposition setting will screw up the field of view and have it point say to your windowsill or some other useless direction.Newer models offered by Foscam include the aforementioned IR cut feature and might be a better choice if you plan to mount these outdoors or in areas exposed to sunlight. Also note that if you place one in front of a window looking out, when night falls and the IR LEDs switch on, the image will be obliterated because of the window glass; to get around this you could mount it again under an eave or maybe in some enclosure that's more weatherproof than the camera itself.", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works great, is a bit large, not overly thrilled with the software", "Author": "terster \"Terster\"", "ReviewID": "R3SQXEMYRZZGZH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I use this, still, to this day.

Caruso", "ReviewID": "R1IDRBZGZGCRTA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "You can't beat what you get for the money on these cameras.  The picture quality is excellent.  The fluidity of motion isn't the best, but that can be drastically affected by both your network and internet speed.  Plus, I run them on wireless and I am sure that causes some additional latency - but with that said, the wireless has no problems connecting or staying connected.  The setup of these cameras took me about 1/2 hour each (including mounting but not including electrical).  The software setup is not too cumbersome but it helps to have a basic understanding of what you want to do with these cameras.  Best way to start is by getting into the web interface for the camera, going to Administrator settings and working your way top to bottom (i.e. selections in the left-hand menu).  If you want to use these external to your network, this is possible, but you will need to set a unique network port for each camera and then set up port forwarding on your router (which can complicate things - but it still simple if you know what you are doing).  If you just want a single camera for use within your network, you should have no problems.  Some other thoughts:- Wifi excellent- Picture excellent- PTZ functions - excellent (though response can be lagging and slow speed (which can be based on network latency) but always works).- Nightvision - excellent- Speaker Audio - POOR - probably my biggest complaint about the cam is the mic audio.  Regardless of what device I am using, the reception of outgoing sound from the camera makes this feature unusable.  So if you are looking to buy it for this purpose, this would be the one reason I would tell you to look elsewhere.  It is also a large reason I only give 3 stars for this review.- Mic Audio - Satisfactory - at first, I was very dissppointed in this feature but after doing quite a bit online research I found that with a few tweaks, many issues are corrected.  Out of the packaging and after setup, you will often hear a very loud clicking noise that makes the audio unbearable.  However, if you just move the wireless antennae around, you will soon find a position that eliminates the wifi interference.  There are some sites online that tell you to open up the camera and play with some of the cabling, but I did this on the first camera and found that FOSCAM had already implemented this fix on the newer models of the 8918 so don't waste your time with this unless you are buying from a site other than amazon (since you won't know what manufacturing lot the camera came from)- Web Interface - I find the web interface to be a bit lacking compared to the app that I use for my android phone and tablet.  The web interace lags when used in a mode that displays the video and audio.  It also will not allow you to have access to all features if using a browser that does not support ActiveX (i.e. Firefox or Google).  I find this a little disappointing.  However, it does allow you to group your cameras together under the IP Address of one of the cameras so that you can see all cameras in one screen.  The PTZ works fine in the web interface but it doesn't allow you to access or create presets.  There is an option to allow presets in the admin settings, but best I can tell, this only allows you to create presets for 3rd party apps and then control the camera through them.All in all, the camera does what it is supposed to (aside from speaker audio) and looking at the prices of cameras with similar features you can't beat the price for the quality that you DO get.Things like sensitivity of motion detection will take a little bit of time to get nailed down as the sensitivity you need will depend on where you put the camera and what your expectations are.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "setup! :-(", "Author": "Gabriel Mercado \"Gabriel\"", "ReviewID": "RS0P7SW4WDMR5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Good camera after all work is done.

The FI8918W  worked great from the start and after using it for a week or so I ordered another one. I mainly wanted a camera that I could see from my smart phone(HTC Thunderbolt) and I installed the app called 'IP Cam Viewer' and it works well.I am also able to pan and tilt the Foscam from my smart phone.The resolution is pretty good and the night vision works better than I thought.It can send audio as well but I have that turned off.To be able to view a camera on a smart phone it's essential that you know how to set up IP forwarding on your home router.  Here are the steps I took to make it work:1. Install the Foscam software on a PC or laptop.2. You'll have to connect the camera to the router with a cable for initial setup. Follow the directions on how to make the initial connection to the camera.3. Using the Foscam software assign it a static IP address outside of the address range that your DHCP is set to. That way it won't change if the router gets reset.4. In the Foscam software also set the port for the camera to some high numbered port.  I used 55555 for the first of my 3 cameras. I set my other 2 cameras to 55556 and 55557.  You will also need to set a user ID and password.5. Then after that you can view the camera inside your home with a web browser by putting in the camera IP and port:[...]6. To view from outside the home and on a smart phone you need to setup IP forwarding in your router. You need to add the port for each camera to the IP forwarding list.  I added 2 entries for each camera, one for TCP and one for UDP traffic. Some cameras use UDP protocol. For each entry enter the IP of the camera and it's port #.7. To see the camera on a smart phone you also need to know the external/public IP address of your router. You should be able to find that in the router settings.Or if you search for \"What's my IP address\" in Google it will tell you that your public IP address is ???.???.???.???.8. Then on my smart phone app you create each camera and you enter the public IP address along with the port you assigned it. Ex. 70.59.???.???:55557You will also need to enter the user ID and password you assigned to the camera.I also bought software for my PC called Blue Iris that I use to record and control the cameras.

This is definitely not a 'plug and play' piece of equipment and it is not meant for someone who is not comfortable dealing with a lot of tech.  There are a lot of steps to get this fully functioning and below are some 'tips' for setting it up.Tips1. I found the manual to be about 50% useful for the purpose of properly setting up the camera.  The other 50% of the necessary information was sourced from detailed reviews on amazon and the web.  I found posts on www networkcamerareviews dot com and foscam's website to have some helpful instructions so try those places if you hit a roadblock.2.  it'll take ~20 seconds for the wireless to initialize/connect so just wait until the back green button blinks faster.3.  Try no-ip dot com to deal with dynamic IP issue (most people have the dynamic IP problem).  The manual says to use Dyndns but they discontinued their free option recently so the manual is completely useless on this part. Unless you want to pay, try no-ip but it's not a perfect solution.  The downside is that no-ip is not set up on foscam to update the IP address.  The only solution i found was to install a program (download from no-ip) on my computer that sends my ip address to no-ip.  of course, this means i'll have to keep my computer on.  I'm hoping foscam will eventually deal with this with a firmware update.4.  camviewer app for iphone is a decent free alternative to some of the paid apps.  It allows you to control the camera (rotate, tilt, IR On/Off,etc.) but there is no sound.Once the camera was set up, it seems to work as described by others.  The motion detection works fine and takes 6 pics when motion is detected.  The IR function allows you to use the camera in the dark.

The PC software generally isn't as slick or easy to use as people have come to expect.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and recommend this product if you need a day/night network camera with a wide field of view and pan/tilt control.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Foscam is no Scam - Nice Camera", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R1XQDQB2KY4EZS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great little wireless cam.

If you try to speak to someone through the camera, they probably won't hear you unless you hook up external speakers with an amplifier. Also, the camera management software is a bit primitive. It works, but could be a lot better. Also, if you plan to manage more than 2 of these cameras with the software, you need to purchase a license which costs big bucks.

I'm fairly tech savvy so can use my router and understand basic to intermediate networking terminology. Managed to login to the cam to make sure it worked, then assigned a static ip and changed the port, rebooted the cam and managed to login via IE with no issues. I had some issues with port forwarding to get it working on my FIOS router but I deleted the rule and added it, followed by a reboot of the router and it seemed to do the trick. It may have got a little confused as I had the trendnet configured to that port previously on a different IP, disabled that rule to get the Foscam working but after various attempts it still wouldnt work externally. I then went and removed the custom rules i had setup completely and started from scratch and then did the trick.GUI- very basic looking compared to the trendnet- it does have good functionality though. Aside from setup and troubleshooting I access from iphone and ipad. To make things easier over 3g I suggest using the presets if you want to move the camera to see different things.iPhone/iPad access- easy, various apps support foscam so its easy to setup. I use Livecams Pro (the free version) but I also tested a few others that also work fine. As an aside I also setup a dyndns alias to make sure that when my ip address changes I'm always ok.Overall, the picture is ok- far from hd but fairly clear. The night mode also works quite well.

Love it. I have been so happy with this. Within a week of using the first one, I was back to order a second.It's under $100 (in Fall 2011). That was the first thing that encouraged me to try this specific camera. And it got good reviews here on Amazon.It was easy to install using a bracket that comes with it. The second camera, we just set on a piece of furniture and have not used the bracket. Then, I can keep an eye on the little kids when they're playing or sleeping and I can move it to different rooms depending on where I am or the kids are.If you install the bracket to the ceiling, then the software allows you to flip the image so that you don't have to watch anything upside down.The IR lights aren't very bright. They work very well and you can see in darkness, but they're not so bright that the baby notices them and can't sleep because of them.You can move the camera from your computer's browser window, so for example if the baby moves to another part of the crib, I can track him and see where he's moved.It's great that the signal is wireless, so we can move it to any part of the house. It works through our brick exterior walls and the signal also works from one floor of our house to another.Unfortunately, you still need a power cord, so there is still a cord. Within the house, this is fine because we have outlets everywhere. Installing it on our front porch though, I did have to drill through from outside to run the power cord to an outlet inside the house (rather than running 50 feet of extension cord to an outside outlet which a burglar could easily unplug).I like the white color because it matches the decor of our house.The software that comes with it is pretty easy to figure out. You can add a date time stamp if you choose, in various colors. You can sync the time with NIST or with your PC or a few other options. With two cameras, I can watch both feeds at the same time. I can also choose one and maximize it to fill up my monitor.The only con is that you cannot zoom in and out, but I still love everything else about the camera.I have been able to take screenshots as well as record manually.I've set up the Alarm Service (motion recording) and the mail settings (to get an email if the camera detects motion and starts recording).I've been happy with those as well. You can set a sensitivity (1 to 10, with 10 being most sensitive) so that the camera can detect motion and start recording. It takes about 1 second for it to realize there has been motion and start recording, so in that time you can miss the person who rang your doorbell, if they're very quick. At first, I had it set at 10 and it would record if the wind blew the nearby trees and shadows changed. I now have it set to 6. It records for a full minute after it detects motion. If my computer is up and running, it will record. If I don't have the camera software running, it will not record. It needs a place to store the video recordings.Within the Alarm Service, you can check a box to have an email sent to up to four email addresses indicating that motion has been detected. I set this up too. It sends 6 screenshots by email of whatever it recorded. And even if my Foscam software isn't running on my computer, it will still send me screenshots by email.This was harder to set up. The instructions were mostly clear, even though they've clearly been translated from some other language. The main issue is testing the set up. I had to search on the internet for answers and the problem is not with the Foscam software but with SMTP email. A lot of IP providers won't allow you to use their SMTP addresses to send email because they are afraid of you sending spam. If you have your own hosting provider, you can use their SMTP address. Even so, if you use the \"Test\" button in the Foscam software, it still often returns that the Test connection was unsuccessful. However, I've learned that's because of the availability of my hosting provider. Once in a while, the test works. So your set up could be correct but the connection test will fail. You have to keep trying with the same settings until it succeeds so that you know you have it right.Because of my SMTP connection not always working right away, if motion is detected, my camera will take screenshots and try to email them to me. It will sometimes take up to about 15 minutes for me to actually receive the email. But I do get the emails eventually. Again, this is because of my email provider and not the camera software. I'm still very happy with this camera and its abilities.I've been very pleased with this camera.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great operation but poor setup information", "Author": "Randolph J.

My $200 panasonic cams have a better daylight picture, but this Foscam blows them away in low light/no light conditions.  I had problems setting up the WIFI.  I scanned on the Wireless lan page while cat5'd to my router (may need to do this more than once), filled in my router's settings, unplugged it and it no longer worked.  It took a minute to realize that when you unplug it and it goes wireless that your router assigns it a new IP address.  Log into your router and find the new wireless IP talking to your router.  Punch that new IP address into your browser and you should be good to go.  For remote access I use the free [...] service.  You set up a free dns account [...] and use their free software to run on your pc which will update your external ip address as it changes (unless you pay extra, you probably have a dynamic IP address that changes frequently.  This is the address that leads outsiders to your router which is different from your 192.168.0.1 network type address).  Allow port forwarding on your router for the network address of your camera and assign a port number (say 8001)... check that the port is open with [...]  Now you should be able to access your camera from outside your network.  Type in[...] and you should get to your log-in screen of the camera.  Note that this dns address won't work from your home network you'll have to try it from your wireless phone or someone else's house.  I use the free Livecams Pro App for my phone.  I hear the $5 Foscam app is good as well.  Also, a huge frustration in remote access was my ATT DSL modem for which I had my own wireless router sitting behind.

Olmstead", "ReviewID": "R2MI6QI7YIKV1D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "See the most recent review at the bottom of this post for my current impressions:---ORIGINAL REVIEW 10/31/11---Exactly what the title says. For the price, I got decent quality audio and video out of this thing. Reviews that claim this camera won't setup properly haven't done the due research to get it up and running.  It DOES work, but you need to know what you are doing with the router and port forwarding.Unfortunately this camera just died, 4 months from purchase.  It leaves me wondering if you get what you pay for. We have another wireless camera in the house by Trendnet that was nearly twice the price, but is still going strong at 6 months of age. I'm hoping the reseller will cut me a break here, but I'm not holding my breath... it died in the sweet spot of being out of warranty but still dying way too early for the money spent. :(I'm trying to contact Foscam as well to see if they will stand behind there product.  Will update this review as I hear more from the reseller or Foscam... hoping for some stand out customer service to rave about, otherwise I'll probably never touch a Foscam again. Its sad, because this price point is great, but if they die this quickly, then its worth spending more money for a better product.---UPDATE 11/3/11---I heard back from Foscam US within 2 hours of sending my email- great, prompt response!  They suggested several ways of fixing the camera, but none did the trick... there's a hard reset on the bottom of the camera that can be accessed with a pin or paperclip. You need to hold this down for longer than 30 seconds and it will hard reset your camera.  Unfortunately this did not work out for me.  Foscam does have a 1 year warranty but they only honor it on cameras sold directly from them.  Because I bought it through Amazon from a reseller, they won't honor it.I also contacted the original seller here on Amazon (azsales). They asked me to contact Foscam US directly and give them their name as the reseller to see if Foscam US would honor this warranty.  The seller asked me to contact them again if Foscam US would not honor the warranty.We'll see what happens. I just sent off another email to Foscam US. Hopefully they will accept the warranty, otherwise I'll be sending an email to the reseller and seeing if they can help me out with this faulty camera.  Stay tuned for another update...---UPDATE 12/31/11---Apologies for how long it took me to update this review- I have mostly good news and am pleased with the experience with this camera.  After contacting Foscam directly, I learned that they will not accept returns on this camera if the camera has been purchased from a third party reseller.  In other words, if you don't buy directly from Foscam, you're out of luck on the manufacturer's warranty. So with that info in mind I contacted the amazon reseller I got this from (azsales). They were great, they said they'd send me a new camera if I could ship the broken one back to them.  I did so and they promptly sent me a new working unit. I even asked for a different color this time (we had the black one, but wanted to go white this time in order to match an area of our home better) and they honored that as well.Knowing all this, I'd feel confident ordering this camera again, but ONLY if I bought it directly from Foscam or the Azsales reseller.  Any other reseller of this camera I wouldn't be able to feel confident with since you'd be at their mercy to get the camera replaced.  If you're ordering this camera here at Amazon, just make sure Azsales is the reseller you are getting this from and not some other reseller.New camera works great. Now that I know how to set these up, its a breeze. The only comment I would say is that the speakers on these really aren't that great.  I've had no problem listening to audio through them, but speaking through them is hit or miss.

Paragas \"Hmm... how about NO!\"", "ReviewID": "R38OC13OGX9XPN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like many have stated, this is a great piece of hardware. There are many capabilities at your disposal (once you get it to properly work). That being said they do work if you put in the effort. I'm not in the IT industry but I do know how to deal with my home network. If you are familiar with forwarding ports, setting up an ftp and such, this should be no problem for you. However, I do believe that the average person will get frustrated trying to make this camera work with its internet capabilities. It took me about 3 hours playing around with the settings and getting all the functions to work properly.If you are just interested in using this as a CCTV and don't need this to be live on the internet then you should be fine with just plugging in the unit and setting up some minor things. It worked straight out of the box and I did not even install the software from the included disc. Everything is self-contained in the camera where all you need to do is login to its internal website.From the limited time I have played with this unit, I have found the following:1) When zero users are logged in and with the motion sensor recording function activated, only a series of still jpgs are recorded in a preset time interval (you can set the recordings in as little as 1 second gaps). You can have the camera automatically email the images to up to 4 recipients at once, store the images on an ftp, or both. There are sensitivity settings for the motion sensor as well.2) From my experience, I can only record video when a computer is logged into the camera. When zero computers are logged in, I have not found how to enable the unit to record video, save it on a remote computer via ftp, and/or email the video file automatically; similar to how it does it with jpgs when zero users are logged in to the camera. I'm not even sure if it is designed to do this. This means if you want video to be recorded, you would need to have a computer logged in to the camera at all times; either remotely or within its own network. Videos are set to record at a 1 min length and from what I can tell cannot be changed. Videos are saved on the computer that is logged in and to a designated folder set by the user. If anyone found a way around this then I apologize for my lack of effort to find the solution to this issue. If I find more information I shall update my post.3) I have not attached a mic to the camera so I cannot comment on the capabilities of sending out audio via the camera but the unit does have a built-in speaker. If the viewer has a microphone connected to the computer they are using, then the viewer is capable of talking to the people (or pets) seen on the other side of the camera. The only mic I used was my gaming headset with an attached mic (which works perfect for gaming), but from this experience, the audio coming out of the camera was extremely low and pretty much non-existent. It could possibly be my mic but like I said, it works fine in a gaming environment so that would make me think the cause of the low audio is the built-in speaker on the camera unit. It would probably work best if you connected a powered speaker to its audio out port which I have yet to test. Similarly, if I find more information, I shall update this post.4) I tried but did not get the email functions to work with gmail, yahoo mail, or hotmail. Even with the suggestions of what others have posted, I kept getting errors and ultimately did not work. I have a 3rd party email system I use with my registered domain. People have had success using their ISP's email which should also be free.5) I got this to work on my iPhone 3g. I tried out the free app called CamViewer and also bought the $5 app called NetCam 16. Both work fine to view and control the camera but the NetCam has a few features that would be useful and I think is worth the low price.6) I did get the DDNS service to work using a free account at DynDns (dot) org. You need to know how to forward ports on your router to get this to work properly. I did not have any issues on my end setting this up.Overall this is a great product. I do plan to buy two more to put around the house. It does everything I want it to do and more. The manual is fairly decent in instructions and got me thru a few sticky situations.

Most baby cams are less than satisfactory because they don't have the range. IP cameras have the range, but seem to lack audio capabilities. Out of all the IP cams, this one is by far the easiest to install. I was able to follow the instructions and it worked great out of the box. My disappointment came with the lack of audio. In researching different bulletin boards, audio issues with this cam are common. Out of the 5 cameras I purchased, only one has any audio at all. Not a big deal if you buy a little microphone for about $3.00 and attach it through the line in in the back of the camera, but even then the sound is not very clear.I am also a Mac user. The software does not have all the features you would need for a baby cam on a Mac browser even though they say they work with all browsers. They only partially work with all browsers. The only browser that supports the full functionality of the camera is Microsoft's Internet Explorer because it needs Active-X, a proprietary Microsoft product. You can see the cameras on Safari, the picture is clear and you can control the camera, but you cannot select audio on Safari so it is worthless as a baby cam using a Mac Computer. However, there are other applications out there for iPhone that work well with the Foscam camera and can completely act as a baby cam. I found applications that can view several cameras at the same time, but there is no audio. I also found a Baby Cam app that can view the camera with sound, but only one camera at a time. The solution is not ideal, yet, but I hope it will be soon. I love the visibility of the camera and the control. The picture is excellent and the camera is reliable.I also purchased Ben Software's Security Spy. It was a complete waste of money since Foscam's software has almost all the same functionality.

I was able to watch my house via any web browser (the IE ActiveX control seems to have a few more options for some reason). I don't care about the sound feature so I won't comment on it. I was able to get the motion sensor working and one feature I like is the ability to schedule when you want the motion sensor to be active (e.g. from midnight to 6am) separately for each day of the week. I was also able to get the FTP and email features working so that whenever the motion sensor was trigger, a series of images was emailed to me and sent to my FTP server. You could also setup the camera to email your cell phone number so that you receive a text whenever the motion sensor is triggered. I haven't done this but it should work. One note, the admin pages have a test settings feature to see if the parameters you enter work, however you need to save them first, then hit the test button to see if it works. Without saving the parameters first the test seems to never work.The pan and tilt features work fine although I wish the camera had a zoom feature. You also have to focus the lens manually by turning it with your hand. Not a deal breaker but it would be nice if it had this option.

I'm a techie so I wasnt worried about configuring it.  As soon as I bought it, I briefly went through the little pamphlet they call a manual and it worked just like instructed.  I first set it up with the ethernet cable, viewed the live feed and was actually impressed.  The default settings to view this on the web is port 80.  I didnt like that because my webserver runs on port 80, so I went and changed it to a non-standard port.  Thats actually a good thing that way people dont try to \"hack\" their way into your web based interface to the cam.  Once that was done, I flipped it upside down, wrote the MAC address down since I have MAC address filtering on my router (using DD-WRT firmware on a WRT54G router), plugged it in, did some port forwarding and viola!  All working.The only thing I dont like is that if I power it off and on it goes on some hunt mode and looks all over the place.  I havent looked to see where it stops at though.  Thats easily corrected by manually logging in and telling it to \"stop\" and repositioning the camera thru the web interface.My camera has 1 defect.  There is a dark spot on the lens, defect from the factory that shows up in the vid feed.  Its very tiny and being that I'm 100% happy with my product, I'm not returning it.I'm also using IP Cam Viewer on my HTC Thunderbolt so I can see a live feed :)Firefox works 100%.I'm also using Zoneminder on Linux also, works great there too :)", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic buy!

The strong points are:1. Sets up easily2. Good image quality3. Easy to control over the internet, with an excellent web browser based interface.

You can turn the infrared vision option on and off remotely and see items clearly, even items in a room which is pitch-black.Weaker points, which may trouble some buyers more than others, depending on their technical expertise:1. Requires some expertise configuring your router. You will have to open a port in your router firewall to get this camera to work over the internet. If your computer and the camera are connected to the same router, and are thus behind the same firewall, you do not have to worry about the firewall, but this requires you be physically near the camera, of course.2. Also requires some expertise with DynDNS, so you can connect to the IP address of the camera remotely.3. I found the wireless-only operation of the camera severely deficient. The connection was lost repeatedly. The connection of the camera to the router must be wired, not wireless, for any decent sort of function.4. The camera image sensor senses infrared, in order to provide the infrared imaging function. However, this produces some funny color abnormalities in daylight operation, just as you would get with a digital camera which has the IR-blocking filter removed. For example sunlit tree leaves and grass appear pink, not green, due to high reflection of infrared. I like infrared photography, so I appreciate this effect.

We wanted a \"Nanny Cam\" that my wife could use to view on her iphone and I could view from work.Here are my observations, hope this helps someone:Setup: The setup within your network is fairly straight forward.  Read the directions and follow them step by step!  Setting up wirelessly took a little time, but eventually got it to work.  I have a static IP address and using a Belkin N+ Wireless Router, so setting up to view remotely as well was not too painful.  I am fairly competent with computers but have never setup an IP camera before or messed around with the router's settings.  Took me about 2.5 hours to get everything running.Image: Quality is good enough for a camera under $100.  The angle is pretty narrow (although it says wide angle). I replaced the lens with a \"2.1mm 160-Degree Wide Angle Lens\" for $6.50.  The new lens is not as sharp but now I can see the entire room without having to move the camera.  If you do a search for \"wide angle lens for foscam\" you will get a couple of hits.Night Vision: Excellent quality - better than I thought it would be.Sound: Ok, you really have to be close for the camera to pick up the sound.Remote pan/tilt: This is what sold me.  Can control camera remotely (from work) or from iphone.iphone Application: Easy to install and setup.  There are a few of them.  I have the free one and the $5 one.

Nice features include the motorized gimbal mount and the IR mode that allows you to see a fairly decent image, even in a dark interior room.  The power cord is not very long, though, maybe four or five feet at most... most people's power outlets are only a couple feet off the floor, meaning this device can't be mounted much above eye level without extension cords, much less on a ceiling.The instruction manual is not the best, written in the sort of \"Engrish\" you would expect from a tech product like this.  It gives you enough information to get set up, provided you are a fairly savvy user.  As mentioned by many other people, wireless setup is not particularly obvious.  When you first connect it with the ethernet cable, it will pick up one IP address from your router.  Configure the wireless settings as instructed, and as soon as it starts the reboot process, unplug the network cable.  Now... here's the tricky part:  let it boot up, then go into your wireless router's admin interface and find the DHCP client table.  Because the wired and wireless interfaces on the device have two different MAC addresses, the wireless interface will pick up a different IP address when it reboots.  The instructions would lead you to assume that you keep trying to connect to it using the original IP address, but you have to look for a device in that DHCP table that has a name that starts with \"ipcamera_\" and use *THAT* IP address.The web interface is serviceable, but not what I would call amazing.  I'm not an IE user, I use Chrome, and the web interface relies heavily on IE for more advanced features like audio.  Audio wasn't a major selling point for me, but based on playing around with IE for purposes of writing this review, audio certainly appears to be the weakest area.  On the other hand, the instructions on setting up a free account with DynDNS and configuring the camera to use it were probably one of the easiest setup tasks involved with this camera, and works quite well.  Once you get it set up on your network, the picture and controls are easy to use and performance is good.  I even got one of several apps available in the iPhone app store that allows me to view and control my camera on my iPhone.  One benefit of IE seems to be the ability to integrate multiple cameras, with 1-, 4- and 9-camera split screen monitoring options available in IE with ActiveX controls, but not the other browsers.  I didn't have enough time to play with any of the alerting features, or any of the features that upload images to e-mail or FTP sites.Picture quality is not going to knock you over, it's a simple 640x480 color image, which is not even as good as most cell phone cameras these days, but if you want high-quality images, you should expect to pay a lot more than what this low-end camera costs.  This camera is all about being low-cost, simple, no-frills with still enough power and flexibility from being able to control it.  The only thing that's missing is a rudimentary digital zoom option - it would be nice if you could get even a little bit of digital zoom, even though that would tend to degrade the picture quality pretty quickly.Now that I've gotten past the hurdle of setting this camera up, I think I'll probably buy another camera eventually and set it up somewhere else, such as in a position to watch our front door.

Well I can't judge it's use for home security, it is perfect for a baby video monitor. The infrared allows for very good quality viewing in complete darkness and you can turn off the flashing network led on the back of the camera.The setup does require some basic networking knowledge to go smoothly (Do you know if your IP is static or dynamic?).

No issues out of the box with the wired LAN.  I was able to upgrade the firmware, change the IP address, set up the WI - FI. Then the problems started...This is what I dealt with: I was able to get it to work after many hours of frustration. I had the MAC address filter turned on, on my router. I entered the MAC address that is given in the WEB UI. The WEB UI gives you the WIRED MAC address, not the wireless MAC address. This will prevent the unit from connecting if you have the wireless filter security option turned on. There is nothing in the literature or interface to provide the wireless MAC address.Fix: I had to turn off the MAC filtering on the router and rebooted the router to clear it. Once the router rebooted, I rebooted the camera as well and it connected right up. I was able to go into the ATTACHED DEVICES option on the router logs and get the wireless MAC address. Once I had that, I enter that into the table, rebooted everything and the wireless connected right away. WPA2 - no problem.The specs on the camera rate it for 8M (24 ft) for IR.  This is not very far.  I wouldn't expect this camera to be able to get features or a person across a lot or yard.  This is a camera for a smaller space/local area.I have a D-Link DCS920 IP camera as well that would not connect to this camera's web interface.  I ended up getting another software that works well with both cameras.  Multiple cameras on a PC for surveillance begins to take a toll.The pan and tilt is a little slow, and the camera reboots after any setting is changed.  A little frustrating.  I would rather have to do one reboot to make all changes take affect, but waiting 30 seconds for each reboot stinks.I don't have any issues with the sound over the wireless connection, but I have not tested it too much.  Still working on that.Overall - I like the camera and I will keep it.UPDATE: 03-10-2011:  The WebUI allows for the location presets to be set as well as the PTZ speed settings.  After messing with the various settings, I have the thing setup the way I want it.  I attached a PoE injector adapter with allows me to run just a Cat5 cable.  The PoE injector on each end allows me to place the camera almost anywhere I can run a CAT5 to.  This is what I used: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QROZB4.  I have figured out how to set the camera up to return to a specific default location if it is powered off.

I just use this camera as a baby monitor. There are several apps made by third parties for the iPhone/iPod and probably android that make interfacing with this thing amazingly easy and impressive. (Just search Foscam on the marketplace/app store) I use an awesome one called Surveillance Pro that I got for 5 bucks.You can also just watch it through the browser on your device...but the app makes it so much better for me just because the apps usually make it easier to tilt and pan the camera and zoom in via double tap.So, the difficult part is just if you want to set it up to be viewable outside your home network. When I say difficult I just mean it's not plug and play. Just look at this tutorial:[...]That will give you an idea of how to do it.

I've also successfully setup the FTP and e-mail service to be used in conjunction with motion detection.  I had troubles configuring the e-mail service to work with my gmail account and had to use my Comcast POP3 account instead.The built in web-interface is pretty easy to figure out and mostly works on my iPod Touch.  The manual pan and tilt controls don't work on the iPod Touch and sound is only available if you use Internet Explorer as it requires ActiveX.  The automatic pan and tilt buttons do work on the iPod Touch.  The video quality leaves a little something to be desired, but this isn't meant to be used for web-conferencing or video chat and the spec of 0.3 mega-pixels pretty much tells that story.  Sound quality is what you'd expect from a device of this nature.  The night vision function is great, but not completely discrete as you will see the the LEDs glowing red when it's active.  The pan and tilt functions work very nicely and allow you to set the sensitivity to quickly zip back and forth or slowly pan around.  There is a scan function (I think it's called \"Patrol\"), which is nice except I haven't figured out how to set hard-stops so sometimes it's scanning the wall behind it.  If you have the sound enabled, the pan and tilt motors make a bit of noise through the interface, but you can't hear them if you're actually next to the camera.  The translation of the PDF manual on the mini-CD to English makes for some good chuckles, but you can get by.  I was unable to get it to work with ZoneMinder, which is an NVR software package for Ubuntu, but that's not a knock on the camera... just an observation for anyone who knows what I'm talking about.The bottom line is that you will be hard pressed to find a camera with these kinds of features for this kind of price.  Cameras with these types of features are normally 3X or more.  I bought this one from \"loftk\" and my only concern is that the stickers on the box and camera were standard mailing address label stickers that were clearly placed over some other labeling.  There are apparently a lot of knock-off Foscams out there and even though this could be one of them, it works fine.  Foscam will only support cameras you buy directly from them, but they charge 50% more.  Either way, I'm considering buying another Foscam... or Foscam knock-off.[UPDATE Mar 2, 2011]I was able to get both cameras (I have two now) to work with ZoneMinder.  The trick was that ZM can't handle 640x480 (at least not from Foscams) so both ZM, and the camera, have to be set to 320x240.On a side note, I was also able to get both cameras to work with iCam by SKJM.  The iCamSource server is running on a Windows box and the iCam app for my iPod Touch allows me to see the cameras wherever I have internet.  The trick with iCam is using the correct address ([..]) in the iCamSource software, where the items in caps would be replaced by your own information.

It isn't a high-def football game view, you can't make out the baby's emotions, but you can definitely tell if they are awake/asleep/screaming.My only real problems are with some of the features not working unless you are using Windows and IE: e.g., no audio.

Direct Foscam support offered no means of return.  A detailed looked at the software running via a direct serial connection indicated software on the camera was put to market before it was completed; probably the reason it locked up.  The second generation is no better and locks up after a bit of time with cgi interaction.  This indicating to me that there is not much improvement yet to the software.

This helped me confirm that the camera would work (better-than-expected as it turned out) with the software I use on my Android phone for viewing and control.The unit seems like it is well built and is pleasing to the touch (powder coat paint finish). I found the setup to be rather simple. First, it needs to be physically plugged into the network. The unit defaults to accepting an IP address from your DHCP server. There is software that came with the camera to detect cameras attached to the network, but I have other software that scans a range of IP addresses and I found the one that I knew was new. I pointed my browser and logged in with the default username and after a few clicks and setting changes, was up and running on my home wireless network. Setting up to be accessed from the outside takes some port forwarding on your router, but it's not a hard task.The video quality isn't the best, but for the money, it is great. Same with the night vision - its not the most uniform night vision illumination, but it gets the job done. I can clearly see objects (they look like white ghosts) in zero light about 20 feet away and still see somewhat to about 40 feet.The two way audio is ok, but nothing to write home about. Even if I had only one of either talk or listen enabled, there was still an echo heard. You definitely will not be able to use the two way communication from your computer without using earphones due to the feedback.The camera comes with a poorly made plastic clamp to assist with wall/ceiling mount. So far, I have it on a shelf, so I'm not using this bracket. The camera base has a standard female camera tripod mount (which this plastic bracket attaches) so a mounting bracket could be made pretty easily.My only disappointment with the camera is the web interface. In order to take advantage of many of the features (audio, saved positions) you have to use Microsoft IE (With ActiveX controls). There is a separate login for other browsers which gives you access to the camera controls, turning on/off the IR LEDS, etc. but no audio.Check out the demo on the Foscam US site and try before you buy.  You do have to give them your e-mail and they send you the passwords for visitor, operator and admin access.

But since I have to work long hours, I can't monitor well their progress. So I bought this Foscam FI8918W from IPcam Central. I got it last night and put it in my bathroom. And I set it up with my Synology NAS Surveillance Station 5. Synology only has official support for the previous version (FI8908W). I pretended that's what I have. This is a night vision motion detected video. As you can see motion detection works very well. The night vision is pretty clear, If I could put the cam at a more open position, I could avoid the high light of my counter top. One thing to note is that because Synology does not officially support this ip cam yet, I don't get audio from it. I am hoping Synology will start working on this product fast. At this reasonable price, this ip cam can be popular for normal families for pets or babies.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "Vernon", "ReviewID": "RVJ4SAI3QGNBC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We use this as a video baby monitor.  We can view, hear, and even talk to the baby through an Internet Explorer browser (also works with Firefox but no audio).  Also got the Foscam Surveillance Pro app for our iPhones ($5) and we can view and control the camera remotely (no audio on iPhone).

It can be maddening at times but overall it delivers what is promised and if you want to keep an eye on your place while you're away - this unit offers a lot. I won't repeat the complaints about the instructions - they could be a lot better. Do yourself a favor and print off the manual on the CD ROM- it's better than the quick guide.  You can also find help on the Web. I wonder why these companies don't just hire an English speaking writer for a few days edit their manuals? I'm pretty good with stand alone PC s but I don't have a lot of experience with networks - still  it didn't take me too long to get it working. If you are the type of person who has never accessed your routers' admin utility this may not be the product for you. Sometimes when accessing my camera from the office it gets buggy - it will lock up - you need to then refresh the browser. This is something of a problem in that the scene in the window remains static giving you a false impression about what you are seeing. It would also be nice if they gave you a better idea as to the meaning of the settings when the cam is in security mode. A minor complaint is that the pan controls don't always respond as intended - for example if you want to pan right it will first pan left all the way to its stop position and then start panning right. The mounting bracket is rather flimsy and does not leave enough clearance for the antenna if mounted flush on a wall.", "Date": "December 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sweet Little Camera", "Author": "ham_n_bill", "ReviewID": "R374WE9S71DGCL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I've had it for about 3 hours. It was up, running and transmitting video within 15 minutes. Not necessary to install any software. I was able to configure right from the built in web interface after I plucked the IP address off the list in my router. It took a little longer to get it onto the web with a domain name through dyndns.. Instruction manual is tough to read as the printing is bad but all the directions are there for everything including the dyndns.I bought right from Foscam as their stated policy for support says that they will not support any sold from other vendors. They provided me with admin access to their demo camera and I was able to learn how everything worked before mine arrived.[...]Durability I can't speak to yet but so far I'm pleased.

are better than any video baby monitor sold at retail stores.  Plus, I always have my iPhone with me so that's just one less thing to carry around.A typical video baby monitor has a 3, maybe 4 inch screen.

Unfortunately, products like this remind me that I'm not as smart about computers as I would like to be. When I'm on the same network, the infrared and normal video works great (not very good color), but you can see very thing clearly.  The sound isn't very good.  Functionally, it works, but it is really delayed (30 seconds at least) and has significant ambient noise, which make it difficult for me to hear people talking in a regular audible level.I have been most disappointed by the fact that I can't see the picture if I'm out of my home network wifi zone.  As I said before, this may simply be my lack of technical knowledge.  Two things about this: (1) if you don't know what port forwarding is, you are already screwed.  So, don't just assume that you are smarter than me. (2) buy this product directly from Foscam if you even thing that you might have to call customer service.  Buying the product through amazon or someone else restricts you from calling them directly although you can still send them an email. I sent them an email a week ago, and still haven't seen a response.Lastly, the power chord is only about 4 feet.  So, unless you are installing this thing right above a power outlet you will have to figure out a way to solve that problem.  I was able to simply splice the chord just after the power inverter and reconnect it just before the camera.I hope this helps someone.

I'm technically quite savvy. I'll list the good and the bad below:*THE GOOD*- pan and tilt works and is quiet- night vision not bad. Due to the LEDs that support it (growing red faintly) if you have this camera no a porch and get a lot of reflections on, say, the railing, you'll not be able to grab anything further away. I think that's more a fault of the kind of caliber night vision reasonably expected in a sub $100 camera than this camera itself. When tried indoors without any bugs around, though, I saw constantly \"wisps\" of movement across the screen- On Windows 7 following the quick-install instructions I got the wired signal happening right away and then next up the wireless (I used WEP encryption with my router) worked fine, too--first time*THE BAD*- picture quality is ghastly. Like, shocking. If you could take the movie The Human Centipede and apply its awfulness to picture quality you'd have this. In 2011 I'd expect better even from a super cheap camera in basically any product- Terrible \"Engrish\" in the quick-install. Engrish being when a person with poor english writes something in english. There's just no darn excuse for that. I could have translated the manual to decent english in literally 20 minutes. Why can't Foscam find somebody to do this, buy them a case of beer for their trouble and be done with it? Shameful.- flaky wireless. I said above wireless hooked up first time, and it did. However, it's really iffy--even with the camera 5' away from my router it's as if the wireless bandwidth is often dial-up in performance. The result is that frame rates can be very low (down to a couple/second) and very, very regularly when I try and bring up the camera's website it will time out...or it will load up the entry screen with \"undefined\" as all of the web controls' labels. While trying to figure out if it was wifi range or simply the camera getting choked up and unable to send back signals I went start > run, \"cmd\". Then \"ping 192.168.1.111 -n 10\" (that IP being the iP of the camera). One would expect 10-30 ms responses for something on a local network but this would even time out the occasional request and average over 100 ms, with some responses 200-300 or even more. I didn't try this test wired- Software is pretty bad. The main complaint actually is that it requires a browser running (IE if you want all features). Therefore, if you have the idea that you want this camera to be running autonomously for days or weeks on end just sending back FTP images (as I had wanted), you can forget it. Requiring an instance of IE running at all times to manage it is absolutely unacceptable. There are plenty of third party IP camera applications such as ispy connect that could work in this capacity (basically in the background), but they cannot make the camera more responsive or solve its flaky wifi.*CONCLUSION*I think this camera would solve its purpose if you're ok with babysitting it regularly. So that means checking in on employees every once in a while for example, but I wouldn't trust it to run long term without needing attention. I'll be trying a different brand. For \"true autonomy\" you need a better camera than these $100 or $200 cameras are, like Mobotix, which has image processing on board. Seems to me a much better approach to life, and it can by itself send images around where they need to go. That is not a slight against this camera though since all in its price range require hand-holding by a PC. I strongly suspect that in this price range the better approach is to rely on ethernet, like the Panasonic that Amazon sells for a little over $100 but isn't wireless.

This camera has an image quality a little higher than you would expect for a $100 IP cam with night vision. It is NOT difficult to setup, if you follow the instructions to a \"T\". If you do not, as with all things computer related it will not work correctly! Apparently some people in the lower reviews do get that.

You need to know how to configure a router to use multiple cameras, but this is not terribly difficult with newer routers. I was able to set up 4 cameras at my elderly inlaws without much difficulty and they have proved invaluable.However, these cameras are not without problems. If the power goes out on the router, the cameras do automatically re-establish connection. Manually cycling the power on the camera  fixes the problem, but this would be very difficult in a remote situation.The sound quality of the built-in mic is passable, but not great. There is a lot of unexplained background noise.Plugging in external powered speaker into the audio out jack  results in excessive 60Hz Hum.Now for the reason for the really low ratings. The two-way audio _only_ works with Internet Explorer, and apparently only works with cameras that are not connected wirelessly. The cameras work poorly with Internet Explorer. The Active X controls are incorrectly signed requiring a bypassing security settings in Internet Explorer. They are also buggy and cause lockups and restarts. I have not been able to get the multi-camera display to work at all and have not been able to get 2-way audio to work in any kind of usable way.In summary, setting up a single camera is simple and works wells. Setting up multiple cameras requires some knowledge of router configuration, but is fairly straight forward. Viewing multiple cameras one-at-a-time with Chrome or Mozzilla also works well.

Wireless N does not work, password was displayed in plain text, wireless signals kept dropping and was very weak, unstable.The software that comes with the camera is primitive, the images are not clear and it is hard to control the camera's movement.

First, the software worked with my MacBook (limited) and my Sony laptop (more detailed, it allowed me to add other camera's, etc.), so it works on both my laptops, PC & Mac OS. Second, buy the Foscam app for your iPhone and iPad, it is worth the $5.99 & $6.99. Now, MOST important, in order to view your home while you are out, you must go into \"Device Managemant\" click on Upnp and click that box, it will give you a web address which is also located on the bottom of the Foscam camera, then you can view your home from anywhere using the Foscam app or you can sign into your camera's web address and view it via Foscam's website and if you add all the devices you can see them through one address. This is free for 3 years and after that it is $8 per month for up too 4 camera's, so that is a great deal. When adding more camera's you must asign a different port, I kept them in order, port 80, 81, etc. In order to make your camera wireless you must sign into the camera and go to wireless, scan and it will pull up networks, choose your network and sign in, I have shared since all my electronics are on a shared secured website. Yes I did call tech support for the little feature of just clicking the Upnp to be able to view my home form outside my house. This should have been noted in the instructions and when I emailed them, it was not answered accordingly, it got too technical and when I called it was simple. So save yourself the headache and follow what I posted, even though tech support was great and quick, it was another country and it made it hard for me to understand him and I allowed him to sign into my Sony laptop and watch him do 1 camera and I did the rest. On the app, you must fill in your address under the \"remote address\" field, this starts with dg and again is on the website or on bottom of the camera in order to view outside your home.

If I want to check in on my iPhone I don't need HD quality (that would choke AT&T;'s network around here anyways).The pan and tilt functions are pretty slow and will test your patience if you have to use them often. Because of this, I was careful to pick a mounting spot that required little panning and tilting (corner of the room).

You can talk through the camera fine, but if you want to listen the audio is very choppy and unintelligible. I took 2 stars off because of that (it's that bad).

We already have a D-Link Wireless Day/Night Network Surveillance Camera with mydlink-Enabled, DCS-932L (White), which definitely has more limited features, but I was very happy with the ease of setup.  We wanted another camera for a second child's room, and decided to get one with better capabilities (higher resolution, pan/tilt).  I started with this Foscam, as I'd heard good things about the brand from a relative.I spent about 45 minutes trying to get this set up, and never did get it going satisfactorily.  In comparison, the D-link model was up and running in just a few minutes, using D-link's proprietary software and web/app interface.  The Foscam was a hassle all the way through the process, with more complicated, poorly-translated instructions.  Setup required changing settings in our network, router manipulation, messing with IP addresses, etc.  All of this is do-able, and the instructions are present, but it is not a quick and easy thing.  The part that made me give up and return this item was that it wouldn't let me change the camera's password.  I waded through all the network hassles, and it eventually worked with no password.  But as the manufacturer recommends, setting a secure password is always a good idea.  I tried several times to set a password, and typed it very carefully, but each time it would then log me out and prevent me from logging in with the password I had just set.  I had to do a factory reset on the camera each time, which was a pain.  Like I said, I eventually gave up and returned it (Thanks to Amazon for solid customer service!).As an alternative, I ordered a D-Link Wireless Pan and Tilt Day/Night Network Surveillance Camera with mydlink-Enabled (DCS-5010L).  This set up almost as easily as the other D-link camera, taking about 10-15 minutes from unboxing to running.  No difficult network or router setting changes are required; apparently D-link's software takes care of that.  As an additional bonus, both cameras are visible from the same app or website, which wouldn't have been the case with two different brand cameras.PLEASE NOTE: If you have more network experience, this Foscam might be fairly easy to install.  Or if you're using it with a different type of camera management software, it might have other advantages over the D-link models.

I have used this device with IP Cam Viewer (Android) and Webcam XP for Windows.  IP Cam Viewer gives me access to the movement controls and 2 Way Audio System that is built into the camera.  I freaked my cats out with it one night while I was away and made noises at them through my Android Phone (which came out the camera's built in speaker).  Overall, the audio from this device is pretty low.  However, the device does offer Mic/Speaker Jacks to connect the device to audio hardware.The device tends to reset at times on its own.  When this happens, the device goes through a series of movements I guess to test the functionality of the motor controls, etc.  However, once this happens the camera won't be pointed in the same place it was before.  So once or twice a week, I find myself linking back to the needed camera from my phone to change its direction again.  This is annoying because this can happen at any time and since I use them for security, there is a chance it may move and then someone breaks in and not get any video footage because it is pointed at the wall or something.I plan on upgrading the firmware for this device to see if that helps.

After a lot of fishing, I found the Foscam line of IP cameras and their price and the fact that I could buy one at a time hooked me.  Wireless? Check.  Smartphone accessible?  Check.  Easy setup?  Errr...well...check if you're a techy-type person.  Installation depends on the camera type, but regardless it's simple and straightforward and needs an electrical outlet nearby.Before you install the camera you'll need to temporarily connect it to your wireless router with a network cable to set up for your WIFI settings (obviously, if you're simply \"hard wiring\" your cameras using network cables rather than using the wireless the following step is not needed).  You'll run a program they give you on CD that \"finds\" the cameras on your network and links that opens a browser with the login.This is your control panel per camera.  Here you change settings, remote control the pan, tilt, zoom style of camera and, if desired, settings for access from outside or via a smartphone.  If you're just planning to view the cameras while at home on your own network you can just add bookmarks/favorites and you're all done.  Be sure to set up a strong username and password if these are private cameras.The smartphone setup is not difficult if you consider a few things...one of them being your router and that it needs a few changes to basically make an address for the camera that you can access from the \"outside\" or via a smartphone or another computer while away from home.  Another thing you will need to know is your current IP address.  This can be found in your router control panel or several ways online (websites, etc).You'll need to set up port forwarding in your router control panel.  In there you'll make up custom port numbers (like 8056, 8057, 8058, etc) to assign to each camera.  That port is used in the smartphone settings along with your current IP address (don't forget user/pass) of your home network in order to access the cameras.  Grab a free or paid smartphone camera app (I use tinyCam pro for Andrioid) enter the settings and you're all set.A tip on remote access....Occasionally your IP changes if the cameras suddenly all stop working double-check your IP and if it's changed all the settings in the smartphone app will need to be updated.  Mine changes every so many months at most so its not really a big deal since the changes take a few minutes tops.Overall these cameras offer what many systems don't but come with a more manual set up and some maintenance.  They don't offer functionality and then tell you there's a monthly fee to use it.  This is the way to go but requires you learn a little along the way.  If I can do it I'm sure you can.

No.  Is it a good product; yes.  For the money, Foscam offers a decent product.  I've got a couple wireless IP cams and there are pro's and con's to each one.  My favorite is the Dericam 502.  It offers 720p resolution, full pan/tilt/zoom, and uses H.264 compression so actually uses less bandwidth at HD then these cameras use for SD 640x480.  The Foscam works well with Blue Iris and my Windows Phone 8 app.  The only thing about Foscams, their frame rate usually maxes out at 10-12FPS.  Not terrible, but is nice to run 15 or better.  While I wouldn't buy another one of these, it is not because they are \"bad\", it is because there is better out there for the money.  This particular model (the 8919) doesn't have IR cut either.

Weaver", "ReviewID": "R13JLZUVBYAHZR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was the first IP camera I set up, and I chose the Foscam brand after reading the reviews.  I had an issue with trying to change the recording location.  Otherwise, there were no issues.  I have some experience in IT, so setup was not difficult at all.  The ISP blocked port 80, so for external access, we configured the router to forward a different port to port 80 on the camera.  Set up DDNS account with no-ip.com, which requires monthly log on to keep it going for free.The camera itself provides a decent picture, and pan/tilt work like they should, and very quietly.  The night vision is surprisingly good.This is an excellent camera for monitoring a baby or any other interior use.  I think the recorded video is probably much better image quality than what you can get from an analog camera that has to conform to ancient analog tv broadcast standards.Since buying this camera, I have tried a couple of other brands as well (HooToo, Agasio).  While they are all similar, the Foscam firmware seems to be the best, but not by much.  Like I said, they are very similar.For anyone serious about surveillance with constant recording, you still have to consider a highly reliable analog solution with a DVR, but for the average homeowner that just wants to add a couple of cameras to their network, so they can get alerts while they are on vacation or whatever, this will more than suffice.  This one doesn't have power-over-Ethernet built in, but the wireless works reliably (unlike some of the other brands!), so put it where you have power but not network.  If you want a camera that goes somewhere you would rather run network wire than power, then look for one with power-over-Ethernet (not this one) and get a PoE switch or an NVR with built-in PoE switch.", "Date": "July 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for Barn Camera", "Author": "Jenna Vsetecka", "ReviewID": "RJYS4J6E302SL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works great in all weather.

The most popular reviews on the main product page are excellent and great sources of knowledge in getting this thing up and working. Some of the negative reviews seem to be based on older firmware, confusion on who should provide tech support and lack of networking experience.For me personally, the camera has worked great and the manual that came with my recently purchased unit I found to be good. The small app that comes with the camera does a great job of sniffing it out on your network and it attached to my router easily through a site survey and took my WPA2 key just fine. It connected to my G and N networks equally well. The MAC address sticker on the bottom turned out to be for the wireless interface.One problem I did come into was when I tried to extend the power cord. The unit is powered by a 5v 2Amp adapter. The cable that comes with it is maybe 6' long. I had planned to mount it high up in my living room area. Since I have a speaker connection plate behind my entertainment center with 2 terminals unused, I cut the power cord and attached the powered end to the terminals. I then ran about 15' of 18 gauge speaker wire up to where I mounted the camera and spliced the end to that. The camera powered up but wasn't getting enough power. It could not maintain the wireless connection while the motor was moving the camera or the IR lights came on. Luckily I was able to run an extension cord up to a ledge near the camera and use the power cord that came with it with the end spliced back on. It works perfectly now. I'm sure that using a wall plate and speaker wire isn't the best way to extend the power cord but I didn't expect it to cause that much of a drop in power.", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good deal for the beginner", "Author": "iBallr", "ReviewID": "R19B1EKY5BJREH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great Lil camera, wide viewing angle.

The pan/tilt feature is nice. Daytime color is pretty good. Indoors the IR night vision will give a decent picture in pitch black. As others have pointed out, the IR will turn a window into a mirror at night. The ability to turn the IR lights off allows you to get around that if you have a little exterior light to take advantage of. The motion or noise alarms are a neat idea, though they do take some sensitivity tinkering depending on your setup. I found it to be a little to sensitive for my tastes, as it liked to spam my inbox while I was at work. The ability to have it upload images to an FTP server instead fixed that inconvenience for me. It also allows the camera to double as a time lapse camera, which is cool. The setup wasn't as bad as a lot of reviews say. Both wired and wireless setups were fairly easy, and even the FTP and alarm settings weren't bad if you accept that you will have to play with them some to find what you like. Most peoples problems with the setup is because they skim and don't actually read the material. Reading and not assuming helps.My only real complaint is with the 3 different viewing pages that  you can choose when you login to the camera directly. The activeX mode has the most features, like the ability to record video. Server push mode is adequate and works if you only have Chrome or Firefox. My real grip is with the mobile view. It would be nice if the mobile view had the same position shortcuts available in the other 2. The only other thing I wish were different is I wish you could define start and stop points for the pan and tilt scan.

I'm happy to report that my thinking here proved correct, and Foscam's setup videos & instruction guides have proven really first-class.  With the aid of Foscam's website, I managed to quickly connect my cameras to my home network (I did have to reinstall my Firefox Browser, but it had been struggling for a while already to play videos).  Foscam's instructions on properly setting up port-forwarding on all common Routers were first-class and I know I would have failed this task without them.  Unfortunately, I was unable to connect to my home network over the internet.  Growing desperate, I called Foscam tech support who quickly established that my network includes not only a Router but also a Vonage Modem.  She quickly added my cameras' ports on the Vonage Modem and immediately confirmed that she could access both cameras over the internet.My only concern about these cameras is the disappointing quality of their images, which look more black-n-white than color and shows mostly vague, washed-out objects.  I understand that these camera may need to meet a certain price target, but their poor image quality really reduces their utility.  It is my understanding that my 18Ws have been replaced by a 10W model which comes with a filter to improve their picture quality (I never realized I bought an outdated model, and Foscam really needs to streamline its model nomenclature).Finally, on YouTube I ran across several (helpful) videos from Foscam enthusiasts, who recommend setting up a Managed DNS Account (e.g. at No-IP.com).

I got the camera and followed the directions to set up. It was fairly simple to set up on my computer BUT I wanted to see it on my iPhone and iPad so I can see my baby when I was in a different room OR away from home. Here comes the DIFFICULT part. I couldn't set up the camera to view on my iPhone to save my life. I emailed Foscam (support@foscam.us) to set up a time to walk me through getting set up. Not once, not twice, not even three times BUT four times did I set up a time for them to call me (on the weekends when I was home from work) to help me set the camera up and NO ONE called at the time they said they would!! They would call me hours later when I wasn't at home. That was almost as frustrating as not being able to set up my camera.  I will however give them an A+ on promptly emailing me back but that didn't do me any good because I really needed someone to walk me through the set up.SO...I called my friend who is a tech master to come over and he got it to work in a couple of hours. The trick is that you have to get the camera's IP address (which you get when you click on IP camera tool) and then add the port number under basic network settings. THEN you type in your camera's IP address in to your web and go to application and gaming and click single port forwarding. In your external port and internal port you put in your port number and at the end of the \"To IP address\" you add in the last three numbers (of the IP address) that you get when you click on to the IP camera tool. You click enabled and click save settings. I know it sounds SO CONFUSING because it it BUT if you get it to work it's AMAZING!! I love being able to see what's going on when I'm at work.APP: We use IP Cam Viewer Pro. You have full duplex audio (so not only can you hear the baby, you can actually talk to the baby via the camera speaker) and you can use the touchscreen to move the camera angle around.https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ip-cam-viewer-pro/id402656416?mt=8Ok, so overview:Camera: A+Ease of setting up at home: B-Ease of setting up on your iPhone/iPad: F----------Friend who came over to help me ou: A++++App once you FINALLY ge it set up: A++++++Good luck friends!", "Date": "May 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Product - Performs exactly as advertised", "Author": "Perry", "ReviewID": "R2W0KGC5MDG0B7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great night vision, great day vision, pan/tilt is great.

I got this camera on a recommendation from a friend who dabbles with this kind of stuff more than I do.  For the price, I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but I got more than I expected.  For example, I didn't realize that Foscam would actually host the DDNS routing for you.  I was expecting I'd have to setup an account with Dyndns service.  Another thing that impressed me was the clarity of the picture.  It's not that it's an HD experience, but I guess I was expecting something more grainy and unfocused.  (think pictures of Big Foot)A few cautions:  While I am super happy with the product, I do think the setup could be tricky for a non techincial type.  If you just want to put it on your network and view the cam from another machine on your network, then most folks can probably handle that.  However, understanding the inner workings of your router, DNS, firewalls, and port-forwarding are something you'll need if you want to setup the cam to be viewed from some device outside your network.Also, while the night vision on this cam is excellent, it become useless if you have it sitting in an interior window sil pointed outside.  This work perfect during the daylight.  But at night, the infrared reflects right off the glass and so all you see is a blank, white screen.  If you want outdoor surveilance at night, you'll need to get the outdoor model which is about $30 more.On balance, for the price, you won't go wrong.

Very satisfied. It's amazing that a camera with pan and tilt, wireless Ethernet, a web server, infrared capability, motion detection, and more can be designed, built, and shipped for this price! Configuration takes place in four steps, with the first three being very simple: 1) hook up the camera, antenna, and power supply; 2) plug the Ethernet cable into the camera and your router and let the software find the camera -- you're soon looking at your first image!; 3) disconnect the Ethernet cable and allow the software to do a wireless scan to find your router; once it does, you enter your network password and now you're looking at another image, this time without the cable!; Now, all of the above steps are easy and this is as far as you need to go if the camera will be used on your own local network. However, if you are like me and want remote access via the Internet, then you need to proceed to Step 4) Enable the camera to serve video through your router by either enabling UPnP (Universal Plug 'n Play) or by opening a port (usually port 80) in your router. This step is a bit more complicated, but by no means difficult for anyone who has ever accessed their router via it's web page. Instructions tell you how to do it and there are web pages to help you for every type of router. In my case, I can watch two different locations in two different cities from my computers and from my Android telephone. I purchased a great Android application that gives me both cameras and more in a tiled format or I can look at each camera individually and control it.

Buy the 8910, the difference in quality doesn't justify the price difference! Some things to know about this line of cameras. They are very easy to access and use because they are IP cameras, but the software they provide is 100% browser based and lacks in functionality... ESPECIALLY if you don't run it in Internet explorer. If you attempt to access the camera in Chrome you will not be able to record to a file on the local machine, and will not have several other options available to you. Also there is no standalone software which means if you want to record you will be paying for a third party software, writing your own, or trying to remember to keep IE on and logged into the cameras.The cameras I received were constantly rebooting so I had to send them back. I replaced them with 2 8910's from a another seller and while they work ok, they are not perfect...Another thing to note these may be wireless but YOU STILL MUST PLUG THE POWER IN. The real problem with this is the cable they supply is a \"wall wart\" and is about 4 or 5 feet long. Meaning wherever you want to install this better have an outlet. Because these cameras run on 5 watts and 2.5 amps you cannot power them on the stock adapters if you attempt to run a line to them through a ceiling unless you are willing to run a real power line and install an outlet. You are not getting more than about ten feet of extension via splicing.If I had this to do over again I'd have either paid for wired cameras (since I need to wire them anyway) or paid an extra 20-30$ for POE ready cameras.One nice thing to mention is there is some programmatic access to the controls via CGI so if you are a programmer you can have some fun with these.", "Date": "March 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very cool camera at a great price", "Author": "Michael L.

It really helps if you understand port forwarding and the inner workings of your router.  If not, you can always find enough info on the internet to get you started.  I even have two of these operating outdoors for over a year now.  Just place it in a protected place where no direct moisture can get to it.  If you own an Android phone, there is an app called TinyCam Pro which is outstanding.  You not only get great video but can control some of the features of the camera with this app.  Finally, the audio features of this camera isn't all that great.

Initially, when people buy cameras, they are amazed, but quickly find that the limiting factor is quality which is tied to picture resolution which relates to the hardware used to capture the image in the camera.  What this means is that if you are expecting images from a camera such as this to be used to identify a burglar walking fifteen feet away from the camera, zooming in on the picture will not get you good enough results.  Similar story for license plates on cars.  Still, cameras such as these are fun and practical high tech toys for some purposes.If possible, use wired connectivity (or a home powerline network) for your network connection.  You can use wireless, but in my experience with this camera, it will sometimes disconnect, and the only way to establish connectivity if that happens is with a power cycle.  The wired connection does not have this problem.Feature-wise, this camera has pan/tilt available via remote control.  Mostly, this works well.  Sometimes, the camera will move on its own (to its home position).Apps exist for smartphones that will connect to this camera over the Internet.  Ask a tech-savvy friend to help you with this setup if it's something you want to do, as it involves some knowledge of your home network configuration.Overall, I would recommend this camera as long as you are looking for a low resolution image for fun purposes and not for any serious security monitoring application.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bad right out of the box.", "Author": "Anastasia Kierst", "ReviewID": "R2J8IRGYAY5C5M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera was a dud right out of the box.

WHEN would you actually look in on your child? When they're asleep / napping.  What condition is the room when they do this?  Dark or very dim.  Guess what the baby monitors look like in this lighting?  Poor.  I've had this camera for a year and a half, mounted on the wall pointing downward towards my son's crib. With the night-vision, it gives me a great view into the crib to see how he's doing.I wanted a camera that was accessible via the Internet and can use my home's WiFi.  I have an IT background so I know how to set up my router to allow me to remotely access the camera, but I'm not going to get into that.  It can be done and it's just a matter of your router's ability, not an issue with the camera itself.I have the Android app, written by Robert Chou.  I can't say how many times this app plus this camera has saved me countless trips to my son's room.  I do have a baby (audio only) monitor and can't tell if he's making noise while sleeping, or rustling around in his crib, awake.  Crying.. if he's standing up or not.  If he's crying and laying down, he'll eventually go back to sleep. This allows me to grab my phone from my bed's nightstand, check-in on him and see whether or not I need to get out of bed and go to him.The camera itself is fine.  I've had a few issues where if I reboot or power off and then on my router, that I could no longer access the camera - I would have to reboot (unplug and plug back in the power) the camera for it to get back onto the network.  This is using the WiFi.  I only used the hardwired network connection doing the initial setup, so I can't attest to its dependability.The audio (mic) on the camera is \"okay\".

The cost of the baby webcams in the baby stores were over $300 for a good one--but were also still stationary. All said, this setup cost us a little over $100 with the camera, apps and shipping. I love the Pan/tilt feature of these cameras. I literally LOVE this camera. Has saved me from waking her up to check in on her (squeaky doors) and during time outs. During her first real temper tantrum that lasted 2.5 hours, I was able to watch her scream, cry and whinge her way thru a list of \"needs\" and then finally give up, find her own binky, crawl into bed and pull up her own covers. Up until then I didn't know she could do that herself! So this camera is worth it's weight in gold. It's also great that if you have multiple children you can get a camera for each room and use the mosaic feature to watch all of them.Infant in Crib:We first installed this camera on the wall above our daughter's crib pointing down over it so we could have a good close up of her. This worked well for a year until she transitioned to her toddler bed.Toddler Room:We now have it installed upside down on the ceiling in the corner of her room so we can pan/tilt the whole room and follow her movements.We use the Foscam Surveillance Pro app (which has audio) to watch on our phones and externally outside our home wifi network we use a DNS with a \"second\" camera set up inside the app.", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Does what I want", "Author": "GeorgeTinkers", "ReviewID": "RR60PCHZF7WGS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera to be able to see my living room on my smartphone.

The first one I had to return as the image was washed out in light purple to the point of rendering it useless.  Tech Support answered my emails in a timely fashion and offered to replace it.  So far I haven't heard back and will just assume the RMA is proceeding along as normal.  The more troubling issue is that now the remaining 2 cameras are starting to randomly reboot and when the reset they point skywards, effectively rendering them useless until I get home and repoint them via the software controls; most annoying.  They appear to be on the latest firmware and I have started reading accounts of this happening with the FI8918Ws - I only wish I would have done more investigation prior to purchasing them.When they do work I am very happy with the picture quality.  Setup was pretty simple and straightforward and it works with my Gmail account.  I didn't use the little software package that is a UI into the ARP cache however I could see how it would be useful for non-techie people.  I started out using DHCP reservations off my Airport Extreme however after a few random reboots and having to climb up ladders to power cycle them to get them back on the network I opted for hard set IPs.  At least now they come back on the network...pointing skyward, but on the network.I purchased a copy of the BlueIris software and feel it wasn't worth the money.  Several times I have had to go back into the software and reset my masking zones as they don't seem to stick - probably due to the camera reboots.  It's okay software for the $40.00 however not as good as Luxriot.  You can only install it on one computer in your house and it offers no client / server model.  I put it on a shuttle I had laying around and RDP into it however the lag is a bit annoying.  Frankly I'm not sure it's that much better than the built in software on the cameras.I enabled external access to my cameras for a bit to play around with them and quickly disabled it as the software doesn't seem to support SSL in any way and the amount of information that can be gained by simply clicking the \"Login\" button and then hitting \"cancel\" is more than I'd feel comfortable with presenting to anybody looking.  My only advice there is to set up an additional account via the software that isn't an Admin and only use those credentials as they will be passed in clear text.  Dunno about you but anything like a camera than can be turned against you and is both a looking and listening device should have some security wrapped around it.  Nothing like that exists for these cameras.  I'll probably build a guest wireless network as well and stick it on thatLastly, like many others I mounted the cameras behind clear, clean panes of glass only to find out the hard way the IR filter will wash out the image at night.  My options seem to be twofold: mount them outside under the eaves (possible) or buy an external IR illuminator (not a bad option).  If they keep misbehaving I'll mount them outside, run them until they die, and then buy some Sharx SCNC2700's and try those.I really want to love these cameras but so far I don't.  They are good lower budget cameras but seem to be glitchy.  Maybe the FI8910W's are better, I don't know.** Update ** While I originally dismissed the software that came with the cameras (IP Camera Tool IPCamera.exe) I did install it last night as I realized it is THE ONLY way to upgrade the firmware on a camera - the web based upgrade utility does nothing - you MUST use the IPCameraTool utility.  It looks like it was written for Windows 3.1 but at least it worked.  You have to upgrade the system firmware first and then the web utility and they do NOT support wireless firmware upgrades - only wired.  You can get firmware here [...]  And, from their tech support: \"There are usually two different firmwares for each Foscam camera. This is based on actual camera hardware and not software or firmware. The difference is that, if loading a newer camera firmware into your camera with older firmware, you have to be sure that the first four numbers are exactly the same before you upgrade. If they are not, you will most likely experience some issues as certain firmwares are made for certain camera hardware. For example if your current firmware starts with 11.22, you must make sure that the firmware you are upgrading to also starts in 11.22, the way you can see which firmware is newest is by looking at the last two digits, that should be greater than your current firmware.\"The upgrade to the latest firmware has done nothing to address my cameras rebooting and losing their wireless signal multiple times a day.  A quick search on the Foscam boards shows many, many others have this same problem. [...] Clearly I didn't do enough research.  I may be asking for my money back or an exchange.I will update the post when I have more info.Update - Changing the wireless authentication did nothing to help me nor did upgrading the firmware to the latest version availableDevice Firmware Version  11.22.2.46Device Embeded Web UI Version  2.4.18.18I just got contact from Mona in Customer Service and am asking for a refund.  I'll report back how it all goes.  From the hours and hours I have spent trying to get these cameras working consistently it appears to me (as others have pointed out) they are unable to handle the AES encryption protocol well.  On LAN the cameras are pinging around ~ 15ms however once they are moved to my wireless network they are coming in at ~+250ms while all my other wireless clients remain in the sub 20ms times.  I set a ping -t against both of them in the morning and went to work.  After I came home and checked the logs I saw a slew of timeouts and groups of timeouts resulting in the cameras being knocked off the network.  I've burned way, way more hours on these then I had ever wanted to and am asking for a refund for the 3 cameras and the BlueIris software.  If you have the ability to segregate these cameras onto an unencrypted network I'd try that.  Or buy better cameras.

Hard reset the camera (hold in reset button 30 second routine)2. plug into computer with Ethernet cable.3. IPCam tools should see it now and give a 169.x.x.x address4. Change the camera settings manually (for routers with 192.168.0.1 as access IP) to 192.168.0.25 for example to match your router IP,  use 255.255.255.0 as subnet mask, 192.168.0.1 for gateway and 8.8.8.8 for DNS5. Go to your router settings : FORWARD the ports 80-81 for 192.168.0.256. Now use Ie (Chrome didn't work, unsure about firefox) and enter address 192.168.0.25 - should go to camera login page7. Allow the Plugin to run if it asks and you should see your camera image.Note: My camera is eligible for the firmware upgrade but cannot be used because although IPCam tools sees the camera for this initial programming, when I try to upgrade the firmware, it keeps saying unable to access camera.  Of course, after programming the IP address for wireless, it no longer sees the new address and you can't upgrade firmware over wireless.  Nice catch 22.The camera itself works great and I can now access it through my phone again.

At this point I have only gotten port 80 to work, but needs more investigation.5.If you want to view from outside your LAN, get a free dyndns address (unless your ISP provides a permanent WAN IP).6.If using iphone, there is a free foscam app that works fine. Don't know yet if it has the ability to view multiple cams, but will find out soon.The printed instructions are pretty worthless.If you are concerned about the total lack of security of the connection outside the home network, there is an iphone app Remoter VNC that allows you to set up VNC over SSH. To do this, you need a home computer that is on while you are away. I use a linux box for this. You use the VNC over SSH connection from phone to home computer, then you are able to securely navigate to your cams by internal IP. The iphone apps are easier, but the SSH offers security. Take your pick.I found that contrary to the instructions, you can use a hidden network. Set it up first over an open network, and after everything is working, switch back to hidden network via your router. I am considering going back to a wired connection for security reasons.If you turn the LED lights off, you *can* put this next to an external window and get a decent picture. With LEDs on, the light reflects off the glass and you see a blob of light.Presently, I have set up with WPA/WPA2 personal security using TKIP. I am unsure if this device supports WPA2 personal (AES), which is more secure, but will try it and post back if anyone comments that they are interested.I also have the Panasonic 121a, about $35 more and has *no* night vision capability at all. Also no pan/tilt function. It does have some other cool features like the ability to attach external wired sensors and feed them into the alarm function inside the device.

Consult with a local computer technician to help you.  However, if you (like me) do this kind of thing for a living, setup was simple and straightfoward.  The camera I received had the latest firmware (one that wasn't even on the Foscam.us website yet), and is supported by Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome.  Some functionality, such as the audio to and from you computer, only works in IE, but pan-and-tilt, and live video work fine.  You'll have to get the IP address from your DHCP server, so you might want to make notes of what's already there before turning on your camera for initial setup.  I saw some other reviews that mentioned the MAC address on the camera label being for the wired interface, not wireless, so that may be a gotcha during setup.  To be honest, I didn't pay attention, I just pulled the IP address that popped up when I turned the camera on, and didn't pay attention to the MAC address.Like I said in my Title, though, this is really an indoor camera.  8 meters is fine inside, but outside, the night vision falls off pretty quick.  The night vision works great in that 8 meters, and the daytime picture is really nice too.

In my case, I fell into the good bucket.  It more or less works as advertised and I can view remotely quite well.  There are some oddities.

The text is a bit poorly written.  \"Sensibility\" is used where \"Sensitivity\" is meant.  Go figure.  Also, to not trigger the motion sensor due to light changes, you turn on \"motion compensation\".  Eh?The motion alarm has not worked out so well for me.  It gives false triggers and sends email.  The snapshots show no motion that I can see.  I've tried several locations and put the sensitivity at the lowest level, but it still triggers.  If this worked better, I'd give it 5 stars.  This makes it lose a star.I am using it with wireless and had no trouble setting it up with a static IP address on my internal network.

I've read reviews in which people say that wireless setup took them around 2 hours. It took me about 1 hour, but I was playing with the camera a lot during setup, trying out different locations to install it, testing the on-board microphone and speaker, etc. If I had to set up another one, it would probably take about 15-20 minutes. I use this camera in the room that my two young daughters share so I can keep an eye on them at night. The camera is responsive, and I have had no trouble operating it. The pan/tilt works flawlessly, and there are a number of apps available (on either the Apple app store or the android market) that work well with this camera. I highly recommend this camera, and I will be buying at least one or two more for myself.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Deal... WIFI and Remote access help", "Author": "C.

My $200 panasonic cams have a better daylight picture, but this Foscam blows them away in low light/no light conditions.  I had problems setting up the WIFI.  I scanned on the Wireless lan page while cat5'd to my router (may need to do this more than once), filled in my router's settings, unplugged it and it no longer worked.  It took a minute to realize that when you unplug it and it goes wireless that your router assigns it a new IP address.  Log into your router and find the new wireless IP talking to your router.  Punch that new IP address into your browser and you should be good to go.  For remote access I use the free [...] service.  You set up a free dns account (eg. [...]) and use their free software to run on your pc which will update your external ip address as it changes (unless you pay extra, you probably have a dynamic IP address that changes frequently.  This is the address that leads outsiders to your router which is different from your 192.168.0.1 network type address).  Allow port forwarding on your router for the network address of your camera and assign a port number (say 8001)... check that the port is open with [...].  Now you should be able to access your camera from outside your network.  Type in Davesvideo.no-ip.com:8001 and you should get to your log-in screen of the camera.  Note that this dns address won't work from your home network you'll have to try it from your wireless phone or someone else's house.  I use the free Livecams Pro App for my phone.  I hear the $5 Foscam app is good as well.  Also, a huge frustration in remote access was my ATT DSL modem for which I had my own wireless router sitting behind.  It would not let me port forward through it.  I ended up getting an ActionTec modem/router GT784WN and got rid of the ATT modem, my other wireless router, and it solved the problem.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very impressed!", "Author": "Ron \"Ron\"", "ReviewID": "R21RY1YOHBPJ6F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm no geek, but after doing some research online i got this babe to work wirelessly and also i can access it via my Droid X using a free app. Very cool gadget!", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Easy to use, versatile little camera", "Author": "Brooks S.

I was not able to get this camera working on WPA on either of my WPA access points. It only seems to like WEP which for a camera is OK security. I had no problems creating port forwarding for external access to the camera. I have several domains pointing into home network so DDNS was not an issue.I have setup and tested email notifications but have not yet enabled the alert management.I am using it outside in a rain protected area and it will be coming indoors when the boats are out of the water which will be about one week before or after the temperature gets down to the camera low temperature limits:)The 300 degrees of PAN allow viewing a large area and the patrol horizontal feature allows one click panning and then stop when you are at the point you want.The IR night view is marginally useful but was not a major factor in my choosing this cameraI agree with other reviewers that having the camera reboot for every configuration change is a pain, but now that things are setup there will be less changes made.The mounting that comes with the camera is not very sturdy but is functional.For Cell phone monitoring I am using IP Cam Viewer by Robert Chou. This Droid APP connects directly to the camera and allows pan and tilt and I can even turn off the IR night view from the phone. This same app allows me to view other static USB web cams as well, so I can view the whole house in one screen while we are away.All in all it is much more than I expected for a $100 camera.

As a surveillance camera, for the price, it is great.  Setup was easy (I didn't try wifi).The servo motion is smooth, optics are very good for the money, setup is relatively easy.The automatic scanning is very cool.Including the he mounting arm is a very nice touch.But let me point out ways the manufacturer could improve.It is somewhat large - no surprise there.The IR LEDs glow red, so they are quite visible in darkness.  A bit of a surprise.There is a way to have it email images (and FTP something, possibly videos), but otherwise it doesn't seem capable of recording images or video streams.  This could be fixed in software, but would likely require an advanced user to make use of it.  Possibly they could integrate with GNU motion or ZoneMinder.Touching the wifi antenna jack often shocks me electrically.The DNS setup doesn't seem to use the DNS servers it obtained from DHCP; I'm guessing it uses some hard-coded DNS servers.  This is a really bad idea, and prevents you from using it on closed networks (ones with limited access to the Internet), or for special internal domain names - UPDATE: this seems to be working now.Documentation is very minimal.  For example, it tells me how to set up FTP, but what is it FTPing?  Same with email.  What is it going to email me?FTP is an insecure protocol; the passwords and data are easily sniffed.  It should use SFTP or scp, IMHO.Not sure if the web interface is SSL-secured, but it should be, for same reason FTP is bad :-/So, in summary, this is a fine system to have if you're having a human being monitoring it 24/7, but until I figure out the emailing and FTP, I cannot tell if it is useful for investigating incidents such as burglary later.Great price - very affordable, you can buy one to play with.  If nobody else is paying the bill, then it's a great choice - for a techie.", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Exceded Expectations", "Author": "Matt Sawyers", "ReviewID": "R16924080NIM3Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Settings:WiredStatic IPCustom portDDNS setupE-mail SMTP setupFTP setupMotion sensor on - (set to a sensitivity of \"5\")No presetsI just wanted something that I could view from my mobile phone of iPad. I noticed that since the interface was Mobile Safari compatible, I grabbed it.Once everything was set up, I found an iPhone app called Foscam Surveillance Pro for $4.99 in the app store that allowed me to control the P/T functions & setup some of the e-mail & motion settings! This product has exceeded my expectations. I noticed that there was mention of it grabbing audio, but hadn't really got it to work. Audio isn't important to me though. I however, did notice an audio in & out jacks on the back of the camera, so I might have to give it a try.During setup I found it difficult to find what settings meant what & I highly suggest going to the Foscam website & downloading the manual PDF (it'll be a RAR file upon download, which is file much like a WinZip file.) This explains in better detail which setting does what.Since I have the e-mail setup, to send me message upon motion, it send me 6 photos every 1 second. Which I personally like better than video because it's much faster to in regards to sending you an alert versus sending you a video clip. The only thing I wish the firmware did, is when sending you a an e-mail you could add your own custom text - e.g. : Room Motion Detected [...]\" So that I could easily & quickly view my IPCamera.As far as quality goes, I'm impressed by the quality for the price of the camera, especially the night vision.To get this camera to work to it's full potential YOU'LL LIKELY NEED SOMEONE ON THE TECHY SIDE.I rate myself as an 7 on a scale of 1-10 (10 Being a professional IT Tech)", "Date": "May 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Camera Good Price", "Author": "Matty H.

I was not router savy at all, but I am pretty good now.  The instructions I found on line were vague at best. There was no mention about internet mapping, and very little about what to put into the mail addresses.  I see this as my problem for not knowing so it has been a learning adventure.  I really didn't have a problem in setup or getting the computer to see the camera. It was getting it out of the router and the cell phone and the email that were the hardest.  I found a lot of help at \"you tube\" of all places.  There were a few pretty helpful videos from others with camera.The camera is pretty light weight and I am trying to use it in a container outside.  It is going to be fun to see how long it will last.  The night vision is better than expected in about a 15 to 20 foot radius.  The picture was fuzzy until I adjusted the lens on the camera to get it focused and set the brightness and contrast set up, and bam, it looked great.  I can see the front door all the way to the driveway.  For a hundred bucks, I have been very pleased.I have had no active x problems. The picture has only wigged out once.  I think that it was a combo of the phone being in a bad signal area and I was sending a lot of moves to it all at one time. It wigged out and I had to reset the power.  Other than that, it has been steady as a rock.  Moves (although not smoothly but gets there) when I tell it.  I am trying to figure out the preset locations which should be much more useful.I am buying another one of these.  I will probably get a IR floodlamp also, so I can turn off the ir on the camera and get a lot further look at the yard area.  From what I have read, I think more people are frustrated at trying to figure the thing out.  I also would make sure you have a strong router for the wireless, wrt54gl or cisco valet plus is what I am using with windows 7.

If you are intimidated at the idea of setup...don't be.  The instructions are adequate to get you started and a quick internet search will net you instructions on how to setup just about any IP camera properly for viewing over the internet.

I was also impressed with the distance of the night vision.  Finally, the motion detection alert via email works as it should.What I didn't like: I was originally going to use this as a baby monitor, but the audio quality and capabilities are just not there.  While it is possible to hear audio, there is too much static/noise and it doesn't pick up the more quiet sounds.  The audio output built-in speaker just doesn't work.  And forget about trying to hear the audio through anything other than Internet Explorer.  For some reason you can't access audio via Firefox or Safari.  Boo!  So it just wasn't versatile enough for me to use as a baby monitor.  Also, while the video quality is decent, fluid motion at 30fps, the color saturation and representation is way off.  Not a big deal, but if that matters to you then don't get this camera.So what was originally going to be a baby monitor is now a camera monitoring our living room and mostly the goings on of our Shih Tzu.  We get a kick out of monitoring the dog while we are away and we could easily add additional cameras to monitor the house, send alerts on movement; aka the house cleaner has arrived, or whatever.

Two-way audio and preset positions work in IE but don't work in other browsers.There is limited 3rd party software compatibility. For example, for Blackberry Totalcontrol app is one of the cheapest but its pan-tilt control is limited for this camera. Foscam does provide .jar app that works fine on regular java-enabled internet-connected cell phones. It's fun to have your camera view on your cell phone. Doesn't work on Blackberry, though, some security API error. For Android free IP Cam viewer works well.Minor: Motion detection saves images to FTP longer than needed. Too many images saved even after motion stopped. In my case it is around 1 GB per week of images. It's too sensitive also (yes, there are settings to adjust it).But, good thing - motion detection works. And it's better to save more images than miss something. Get FTP account outside for cheap or save images to your NAS/server and synchronize folder with Dropbox or Skydrive and you will get images of intruders even if they steal all electronics.Sometimes when I connect to camera with IE it reboots. Takes couple of minutes to find home position. Doesn't do that with other browsers. That's actually the biggest annoyance. I updated to latest firmware, of course. Make sure camera home position looks at right spot, will help in case of power outage.Despite all flaws that I listed it is still a decent camera for the money.It will do its job unattended, saving images when motion is detected. And you can monitor it from outside of your home with some minor limitations.It adjusts sensitivity automatically. I found outdoor mode the best. In my case it is looking through window to outside and after panning it sees inside darker house without adjustments.During the night it doesn't see much because I had to turn infrared off - it reflects from window glass. But, there is automatic motion-sensing light in my house, it helps. Infrared on camera works well, though - can see in total darkness if there is no glass in front of camera.Image is good enough for security camera.Setting it up is very easy if you have your router set up for access from outside, know about DynDNS and port forwarding.", "Date": "March 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Satisfied", "Author": "B.

I hoped to get an OK camera at a decent price.  Boy was I surprised!!!  The picture is actually of good quality, much better than I expected!  I not sure what some of the negative reviewers expected from an IP camera to begin with---  It's not a big screen LCD HDTV for Petes sake.  I mostly bought it for light security and a pet cam.  It definitely fits these need easily.  Picture is clear, software \"fairly\" easy to manage and FULL of functions!!  You do have to know your way around your router pretty well to make installation easy, but it does come with decent directions.  You just have to make sure you follow directions to the letter, no skipping steps or it will not work.  Of coarse I \"knew\" I could install it easily being computer saavy and all.......  Yeah, I skipped one step because I knew it all and had a fit for about an hour trying to get the internet part working.  Finally I just reset the camera, followed the directions exactly and **POOF** worked perfectly ever since.  That's my biggest recommendation for everyone..  FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!!  Really, it was fairly simple and once it was up and running I got to see how well this camera performs!!!  Over the internet, refresh rates are good (Obviously depends partly on your internet connection), user interface of software is easy.  It is great having pan/tilt capability, especially remotely.  It works very well.  I have not used the motion detection/ recording part of it, so I cannot comment on that.  Hooked it up to my android based phone (I used IP Cam Viewer lite--free) and can watch my camera from anywhere I get data service!!  I love this camera.  One last feature to comment on is the IR (Night vision), I didn't expect much from a small camera, it works perfectly.  The area I watch is about 12-15feet away from camera and it lights it up just like the lights are on, but obviously in \"black and white.\"  Don't expect color for IR, nothing gives you that.  The IR really does work great, though.  Overall, I was VERY pleasantly surprised on the quality of the picture this camera gives.  I would buy another (and may)and have NO problem recommeding it to others!!  And the great thing about it, is once you have it set up, the settings are saved in memory so I can just unplug the power, move it to another room, plug it back into power, and **POOF, again** works perfectly.  So, I can watch my puppy downstairs during the day, when I leave at night I can bring it upstairs to watch the front door.  No problems, no extra setup.

All in all I am very satisfied with the camera.  I have it set on motion detection in my living room so that it watches the door and the tv.  I also have it set up to automatically send emails when motion is detected, which come to my phone within about 10 seconds.  I have only had the camera set up for two days and still have some small bugs to work out that I am hoping someone can help with.  One issuse I am having is with the schedule feature for the motion detection.  If I leave the house when the camera is not set on the schedule, then I want to turn it on.  To do this, I simple uncheck the schedule box.  The problem is when I turn the schedule back on, I have lost my previous schedule and have to redo it.  I would be grateful if anyone had a solution to this.  Also, I have had no luck in getting the app on my HTC Hero to work and have not even attempted to figure out how to access it on the internet.

The big problem I have with this is, is when you have both the mic and speaker 'on' you get really bad feedback on the computer.  I'll speak into it, then I'll hear myself feedback through the mic and then it will echo that back and forth continually for a half a dozen times, until it finally fades out.  That can be a bit frustrating.  The only way around it is to speak and turn off the mic once you've heard yourself on the other end, and then turn it back on.  If you have just the mic or just the speaker on, then there's no feedback problems.  Not the greatest of sound quality but pretty good.Excellent viewing options, nearly 360.  Very slow though.  It'll take about 30 seconds to get from one end to the other, I'd like if it were a bit quicker.  Fairly simple setup.

You can clearly see 25 feet through my livingroom in complete darkness.  Alarm option is great too, having pictures emailed to my Blackberry if motion is detected while I'm away.

Well, the easiest way is to keep a PC handy and use the \"IP Camera Tool\" that came with it. You could download IP Scanner ... but for me it didn't work cause I have more than 6 devices... you have to pay for it to see more.So, I would say the software is fairly lame.

The camera has a nice rubberized surface, and the motor and mount appear to be tightly put together.  There's no shaking or movement when the camera pans or tilts.- Good low light (i.e. infrared) capability.  I can see a decent image in total darkness.- It has a lot of administrative and value-added features that I found helpful (like an FTP client that can dump still images on a remote server on a schedule)- Works nicely with a 3rd party Android app called IP Cam Viewer.The not-so-good:- Setup was a royal pain.  The user manual is pretty useless.  It took a lot of trial and error to get it to connect to my AirPort base station.- There are 2 MAC address labels on the camera and it's not clear that one is for the ethernet adapter and the other is for the wifi adapter.- The \"security\" on the software is a joke.  Try this:  Go to the login screen and click submit without entering any credentials.  Enjoy wide open access without supplying actual credentials.  It's like the username/password fields are just there for show and they don't actually DO anything.  In a closed network, it's not a huge deal, but still something to be aware of.

They are easy to setup for viewing if you follow the directions step by step. The firmware is very buggy to capture images and I have yet to get this to work for any of them after spending about sixty hours on this with lastest firmware. Foscam customer support is difficult because they will ask you were you purchased them from and will direct you back were you purchased them for any type of support. Good luck with Foscam to help you with anything. The other thing I notice was the color quality is on the poor side but the image is clear. Night time operation is acceptable. Only IE supports all the camera features. Internet viewing requires you to port forward on your router and register yourself on a website provided in the instruction manual. It is free but if you don't access your camera from the internet after 30 days your account goes inactive on the website and your internet camera feature stops working. If you pay fifteen dollars for the pro version a year it prevents this from happening and is worth it.

I just wanted to contribute my 5 star rating, as well as some tips for port forwarding with Dyndns and multiple cameras.If you want to view multiple cameras from outside your home network, you only need to register one \"Host with IP address\" host with Dyndns.  Then, just specify sequential ports to forward each camera.  For example, I have MYNAME.dyndns-ip.com (MYNAME is just an example) with port 8100 forwarding to my first camera, port 8101 forwarding to my second camera, etc.  Then just log into the \"master\" camera at MYNAME.dyndns-ip.com:8100 and you'll see all cameras on your home network.  It's a bit more involved than this, but enabling only one host with Dyndns will allow you to only use their free service, since more than 2 hosts requires a subscription.If you were to contract a security company to install a system with a few couple of these cameras, they'd charge a couple thousand dollars.  You can easily do it yourself for so much less.  To view from outside your home network, you will of course need to setup port forwarding, but get a computer friend to help you if you're not familiar with that part.  Sorry, security cam installation companies that vote this unhelpful, but it's true - consumers don't need you.Note that there are no \"official\" iPhone apps from this manufacturer.  All of them are by 3rd party software companies.  The one that works amazing well is called Foscam Surveillance Pro by Maurice de Bijl.

I was completely helpless and John did an amazing job of helping me through each and every step. He was professional, helpful, and literally did everything for me. I am amazed at how patient he was with me and my plethora of questions. Not only did John walk me through how to access my camera from my own personal network, but he also helped me install an app on all my iphones.My husband is in the military and deploys quite frequently, but now he is able to log in from anywhere in the world and see our children playing. This is also great for the grandparents as we never live in the same state.THANK YOU JOHN and THANK YOU FOSCAM for providing exceptionally great customer service. Words seem inadequate to express my appreciation and gratitude, especially when so many service providers have such horrible customer service and/or no service at all.I HIGHLY recommend Foscam cameras and their technical support! If anyone has any questions or doubts about purchasing a Foscam camera, please ask me questions or email me and I will give you my personal cell phone number or email address so you can know and trust that I am not being paid in any way for this review as I have seen so many reviewers on here saying the reviews are trumped up and are from customer service representatives from FOSCAM. This is proof that is not the case in this situation.You will not regret buying this camera. I have purchased and used the Motorola MBP33, the Angelcare Baby Movement and Sound Monitor, and the Secure Coverage Digital Monitor by Graco. They are all okay monitors, but this one has it all. You can not only talk to your child, but you can move the camera, pan, tilt, etc. This comes in handy when your child is potty training and you want to make sure they are not repainting his/her room with their feces.The Motorola did fine for about 8months. Motorola sent us a replacement, which was a refurbished one. About 7 months later it started to go out, but Motorola said it was a year past the original purchase date and the warranty was no longer valid. So, less than a year of the Motorola working, the screen started going out, and recently the battery no longer charges and has to be turned just right in order to stay \"connected.\" In other words, we wrap the cord around the parent monitor a few times before it stays connected to give the unit power. UPDATE: Motorola unit stopped working completely in less than 12 months of ownership.The Angelcare worked great when we lived in a single story, ranch-style home, but now that we are in a two story home, there was too much interference and it would not work even if I was standing underneath it. Also, the original Angelcare unit we had stopped working after 20 months.The Graco monitor was your basic, run of the mill monitor, but it does not give you any video or allow you to communicate with your child. And after using it in our 9 month daughter's room from day one, the speakers sometimes go out and the two units still have a hard time connecting a few times a day.We love being able to talk with our child, especially our toddler who likes to get out of bed and play when it is midnight and beyond. This is all around the best monitor, especially for the money.UPDATE:After a few weeks of using this camera I have noticed a few extra pros and cons.Pros:- Cannot beat the reception at any distance.- Picture quality is amazing.- LOVE being able to move the camera from the computer or phone.Cons:- The sound does not always work on my computer. Maybe this is a software issue? I have a MacBook.- If I am using my phone as the monitor, then begin to use my phone to make a call, I have to switch to the computer to view the monitor or hear the sounds which is not always convenient.- Can be hacked into. SET A PASSWORD to protect your family.After all is said and done, we have ordered another camera to install in our other child's room, but we also got a standard, run of the mill audio monitor for when I am on the phone and want to have the constant audio monitoring in the background. For a smaller home, this may not be an issue, but for a multilevel home, you may need to work something else out.", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "I would not recomend this", "Author": "Scott \"Scott M.

I called foscam support and had an amazing experience with Judy. She took over my computer, re connected my camera, set up the remote viewing address so I can look at my camera from ANYWHERE and she set me up with a static ip address so it will never change again!

This is according to Foscam support.I needed the camera for a weekend project so I sprung for the overnight shipping.  The listing said that I would receive it the next day if I ordered in the next three hours.  However, It was well over 24 hours before it even shipped and I did not get it until four days later.Once I saw that it was not coming from Amazon and I was not getting it the next day, I tried to cancel.  After a few minutes I received an automated response telling me it was too late to cancel, but I was welcome to refuse delivery.I ordered from Amazon (I double checked the listing and no mention of WickedSpec),  I paid for the overnight shipping, but that is not a thing with \"WickedSpec\" as it takes longer than that for them to put it in the box and send it off.I was not allowed to cancel and reorder elsewhere, even though it had clearly not shipped.As for the camera, I ran into these issues.  They may defects or by design, but since I can't talk to support, who knows.- The wall mount is too small.  The camera will fit on it, but there is no room for the power cord or antenna.- The IR LEDs do turn off manually as advertised,  But it does not turn off automatically.  Ether way, the camera remains in IR mode.  So when the area is lighted, everything has that bluish green washed out look that is caused by IR mode.- The two way audio is not available on IE and will only work on Firefox with a plugin.  No info is provided as to what plugin and where it can be obtained.- It takes almost five minutes to initialize after it is plugged in or restarted.  You can see after a minute or so, but it continues to cycle around for several more minutes.I have bought similar cameras off Ebay only to find that they were knockoffs.  Even though I had no problem with their quality, I was uncomfortable buying counterfeit.  So I went to extra effort to make sure it did not happen again.

At first glance the product looks polished. The hardwire LAN hook up using the packaged software is simple. The more difficult part is to configure the wireless network depending on your router specs (make sure to turn on SSID broadcasting first and study how to configure your router for port forwarding before you start). My crappy 2wire router didn't allow me to use dyndns.org addresses on the internal network and I wasted extra 4 hours checking settings. At the end I used a proxy site to confirm that the address works. The hardest part of the setup, however, is to find the appropriate email and FTP sites for the motion alarms. It took a day's worth of trying different email/network storage providers to find the ones that both works with this camera and are free. Of course if you are willing to pay for some of these services the setup may be much easier. So after using the cameras for a couple of weeks here are my thoughts of the camera:The Positive:1. Inexpensive considering it has a manufaturer that provides support with firmware upgrades from the .com website (not .us and don't buy ebay knock-offs); although the site has been down in the last 2 weeks. Supposively under maintenance. Come on Foscam! It's been 2 weeks!2. Images are acceptable and motion alarm works (sends all these emails to my account all day long with images of the mail man, UPS guy, me driving into the driveway, a stranger driving into my drive way...)3. Wireless G that supports WPA AES encryption (which makes me feel safer even though I now have to broadcast my SSID)4. pretty decent night vision even without using the built in infrared.5. Pans and tilts at a variety of directions.The negatives:1. The software needs some work (some of the functions don't work, like changing frame rates, or setup time of the day for motion alarm not working for sunday mornings)2. Motion alarm catches way too much motions when the weather is partly cloudy3. The speaker and mic on the camera may not perform well depending on the location of the camera or some other random variables (try rebooting and relocate if you can't get good sound the first time, although some older models have hardware issues if you search online forums)4. Infrared night vision sometimes blurs facial images5. Infrared night vision uses a visible spectrum so one can see the lights are on (please use a spectrum that's not visible, Foscam!)6. Wireless setup requires the broadcasting of SSID (At least the Camera supports WPA AES)7. The quick install and user manuals could be improved, especially the User manual which has poorly written English and doesn't even explain all the features. I am a relatively network savvy person, and it took me 6 hours to set this up including the 4 hours that I blame on my crappy router which I have since upgraded.8.
