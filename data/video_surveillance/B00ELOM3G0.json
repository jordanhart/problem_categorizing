{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Value", "Author": "R.

This one is about half the price and is color. I bought this because my monochrome one started to fog up after several years of being outside.  This one has started fogging after being outside just a few months.  The location where you mount it has a lot to do with the lifespan of the unit. I put this on a fence in direct sunlight and exposure to the elements which is not recommended.  I think that's what finally killed my previous camera.  I think I'm going to buy a small bird house and put this inside to protect it from the elements, sorry birds!Pros:- Inexpensive Sony color CCD (if it really is a Sony sensor)- Inconspicuous bullet/ lipstick shape with no glowing IR LEDs around it.- Good in low light.Cons:- The clarity is not as good as the monochrome version (this is definitely NOT 700 lines).- Not as sensitive to low light as the monochrome .0003 lux version.- Fogged up after a few months being outside.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$42.95", "Features": "Mini 700TVL 1/3 Sony CCD Security Video Surveillance Bullet Color Camera 0.01Lux\n1/3\" Sony Super HAD CCD II\nDSP: Effio-E (4140+811/810)\nLens: 3.6mm Lens\nPower Source: DC 12V (NOT INCLUDED)", "Name": "Indoor Outdoor Color Bullet Security Camera 700 TVL Built-in Sony CCD 3.6 mm Fix Wide Angle View Lens for CCTV DVR Home Office Surveillance Secure System Weatherproof DC 12V Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31PeBGHDK0L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00ELOM3G0"}}
