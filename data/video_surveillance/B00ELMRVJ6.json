After contacting the company the camera IS wireless, but I ran into a lot of bugs trying to set it up.  First, I tried to set up on my Samsung S3 and had to install the suggested barcode scanner to read the sticker on the box. But it never worked, it was easier to simply \"find\" the camera using the phone's wifi settings.  Then, once found, the Anyscene app dies on my Samsung S3 everytime I get to the point of entering my wireless access code - so setting up via phone never actually worked. The instructions for setting up via PC worked, but it runs in IE only and after getting the wifi hooked up and then the first few settings screens, I had to often close down the browser and start the app over. I did manage to get it set up on wifi, eventually. As for the camera itself, the feed can be accessed via my phone and on my laptop and it's a good image, both color and infrared. I'm hoping the motionless sensing alerts, etc. work as promised.  I'll update once I know.", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "The camera works nicely", "Author": "Aster", "ReviewID": "R1MHD4B6GE9PR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The arrival of the camera took longer than the estimated time of delivery and it took a while to clear of off the customs of the destination country. Apart from these the product is favorable and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to purchase an surveillance camera for their indoor security.The camera has solid build and quite small when compared to other similar products. It's small enough to conceal from the eyes of a  probable prying eye that is checking to see if there's any security cameras around.The installation cd-rom inside the package was broken/cracked, which propabaly is due to bad-handling at the customs. I contacted the Trivision Tech support from their email printed inside the manual that comes with the camera gear and they almost immediately provided me with the online links to download the content files of the broken cd and the appropriate manuals for different apps.Installation, both on pc and android smart phone was extremely easy, almost instant.The camera is working nicely and with impressive colour range.Hope anyone who purchases this product enjoys the same satisfaction I got from my experience.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00ELMRVJ6"}}
