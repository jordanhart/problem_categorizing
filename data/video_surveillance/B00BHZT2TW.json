{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Better than Good !", "Author": "dep", "ReviewID": "R12ZTN7GODEBKR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very clear camera/dvr communication providing for an excellent picture.  If you need longer distances to be lit, you may need an IR light or two however it doesn't get much better than this. You'll love the clarity. You must have HD cameras or the camera will not work. Easy set up. The only issue I have is that the ptz memory chip is stationed outside the dvd itself. This is a fragile chip similar to a memory stick and in my opinion should be inside the unit, not outside of it. I wish I had gotten the one with 16 channels !!", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,259.99", "Features": "Swann HD 1080p 8Ch 4 Cam 1000TVL 3TB HDD Sec Sys", "Name": "Swann HD 1080p 8Ch 4 Cam 1000TVL 3TB HDD Sec Sys", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41pB0VC30SL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BHZT2TW"}}
