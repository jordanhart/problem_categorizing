I also installed two other cameras, from a different manufacturer that provide a live feed to the house, so these NightWatcher cameras are for backup/alternate angles (and also for their motion tracking lights).  Since the NightWatchers record directly to their on-board SD cards, they are not useful for live-monitoring.  However, they work well in their designed capacity.  The tracking function is really cool, and seems to make for an intimidating deterrent.One tip: One of my NightWatcher lights was coming on every time a car drove by on the street, because the motion detection has a pretty long range.  I made it \"near-sighted\" by placing electrical tape over the upper portion of the motion detection window on the NightWatcher.  Now, it only \"sees\" when there is motion on the driveway and near the garage. Perfect.  Raise or lower the tape on the window to adjust the range.I am satisfied with these camera/lights.", "Date": "June 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "No support from Nightwatcher", "Author": "H.

However, the enjoyment didn't last long - a few weeks after it was installed, it began staying on literally all night, wildly scanning the yard even when there was no movement to be found.  It was, frankly, creepy - and I'm sure my neighbors across the street didn't appreciate the constant bright light and frantic movement.  I tried for weeks to email/call customer service and never heard back.  (And it wasn't just my unit - my contractor had bought the same light and reported similar issues.)That was a little over a year ago.  Eventually (once the weather got warmer?) the light started functioning as usual and I forgot about it.  But we're back into winter here, and sure enough the light started doing the same thing.  And then, all of sudden, the bulb just went out.  It's an LED so I can't imagine (even with constant use) that the bulb actually died, but somehow, even though the unit still tracks movement, it doesn't light up anymore, ever.  It's been weeks now without a functioning light.  Wondering if maybe it will right itself when it gets warm again... but what good is a light that only works three seasons a year?Now the company's phone number is out of service, and I imagine I am out of luck.

I bought my first at CostCo, but they stopped carrying it for some of the reasons listed in the reviews. The support and directions are very poor which is very unfortunate. If you stop the movement of the light, your first thought is \"that it broke\", but all you need to do is to disconnect the power source and then reconnect it for it to start working again. The product is also all plastic, so it will break easily if you drop it. It's seal around the conduit box is somewhat less than adequate (even with the gasket that comes with the product). You can use some outdoor duct tape in this area to solve the problem. The video quality is poor, but most cameras do not have great video quality (so actually is just ok). What they do not tell you is that you will need an electrician to run wiring and a conduit box to the area that you want to mount the light (similar to any other security light). The advantage of this product is that it uses a lower wattage and very bright LED light (vs a halogen light). This product has been a great help from keeping vandals and other unwanted people from loitering around my property.

Don't position it close to ivy or trees as they will switch it on.3. On a sunny day - the sun will blind the camera - as it will shine directly into it.4. The instructions warn you not to take the sd card out if the camera is recording, but it is almost impossible to get near the nightwatcher without it coming on automatically. I took the sd card out while it was recording and it corrupted the sd card. It would not reformat and I had to throw it away.5. The sd card supplied was only 2 GB. This may be ok it the camera only switches on two or three times a day, but get a larger SD card for anything more - they are quite cheap.6. Don't try to switch it off with a bamboo cane - I did and the cane went into the switch off button and broke it.7. It needs to be positioned some distance from the area you want secure otherwise you will not be able to tilt the angle of the camera low enough.8. The camera detects the thief and switches on, but then immediately scans the other areas, only giving a fraction of a second on the thief.9. If the thief is moving then the immage is slightly blurred. If the camera then moves, then the immage is just one blur and you will not be able to recognise the thief.10. The thief needs to be within 4m (12ft) of the camera, otherwise the light will not be able to reach him. The light, however, is dazzlingly bright - too bright to welcome visitors.10. The camera should be positioned between 2m and 3m above ground. This would allow the thief to switch it off, and disconnect it, to sell in the neaarest pub.GOOD POINTSEverything else.

Some lights turn on when the wind picks up but this light is smart enough to stay off and not turn on with swaying trees and bushes. For correct operation the key is setting it up properly. Get familiar with the directions before installing the light, that way you will save time getting it up and running. I put mine up in Feb., it was very cold and windy here where I live. The next day we had wind, heavy snow 8\" - 12\" fell, and this light tracked me during the storm with the snow falling even at night!  I observed that when an object moves passed a detected zone and if it looses track, it will hunt for the object by scanning back and forth until it finds it. If it does not find the object it will go back to the point at which it was first detected and wait until it times out. Note that all sensors are active all the time so no matter which direction the camera is facing it will always turn to where the action is even if there is action in 2 places it will watch both!  I think this light is a great idea and will be getting a new black one for the porch when it comes available other than white. Looks like the EUROPEAN models 220v are black, I need a USA 120v LED with camera.  I highly recommend this light for added security, but it is not for anyone who does not know how to program it. It is high tech and needs a skilled person to program it.Programming: Make sure the clock is set correctly and that the correct mode which you want is enabled. There is buttons on top for the video and time, on the Left side for the audio, and on the bottom for different modes.

I have had it for two years with no problems.  It is bright and since it follows motion, it is a real deterrent.  Very intimidating for most thieves.  It also has a function which will enable you to record a message such as \"intruder alert, police have been notified\".  You can also use one of the prerecorded sounds such as a dog barking.  It really sounds as though the dog is barking in the house in my case.  The camera is of little use in the the pictures captured in most instances are not the quality for a positive ID even if the person is not trying to conceal is face.  However, it will let you know if it is a cat prowling around or an animal of the two legged variety.I see that this item has gotten a number of poor reviews.  Let me address some of the problems.1)  \"Quit working within a short period\"  I have had one for 2 years and it works fine still.  I'm guessing that the light is not properly mounted to prevent water intrusion.  One person complained it quit working because it was filled with water.  Probably mounted in the open without the seal properly positioned.  I have had another traditional LED security light do the same thing.  I find that even if a security light is said to be an outdoor light, it still pays to at least to place it where precipitation does not fall directly on top of it especially if it has complicated electronics in it such as with LEDs.  With the light head being able to move and the other features of the light, there is probably more places for water to enter.  I have mine under a deck and I've had no problems.2) \"Various problems with picture quality.\"  The whole outfit only cost $129.00 at Costco or maybe a little more depending when you bought it.  This does not contain a high quality, high megapixel infrared camera and will probably rarely work during the day, let alone at night to the point of identifying positively who the intruder is.  However, it will tell you if it is just a cat or actually someone snooping around your property and that is valuable information in and of itself.3)  Short video times.  I don't know about this but mine does several days or more before running out of space and starting over.  I mean, this is not an expensive surveillance system.4)  SD card hard to remove without erasing.  Hey, you've got to read the directions on how to do it without damaging the SD card.  Not hard to do.In summary, I have been very satisfied with my unit.

(Thousands of time/date stamped photos per day, though fairly low quality and many blurry due to movement.)I recommend upgrading to a 32GB SD card (about $25 dollars) to store about a month of pictures (new pictures will save over the oldest photos if the card is full).  (I have two cards, so if I want to review pictures, I just swap cards).All-in-all, this unit is a good buy and low maintenance (no batteries to change).  Our car was broken into a few years ago, and this unit would capture that type of event in the future, or deter a similar event with its motion activated movement and bright light.I was about to purchase this unit from Amazon, but I got a better price and better warranty from Cost-Co.  So far, highly recommended for the price, 4 stars over-all.", "Date": "July 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Does everything it says", "Author": "Robert Nelson", "ReviewID": "R25STL88ZSFHDO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not sure what problem's others are having but this setup works great for me.

The video quality is very clear, the LED lights are very bright I would guess about the equivalent of a 150 Watt spotlight. The really nice thing about this unit is that the light and camera track your movement.
