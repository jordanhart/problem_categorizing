I have not hooked it up yet because I am trying to track down the wires in the house from the old cameras, but I did test the system in the house and it works very well especially the night vision.  I will update when I can finally complete the install.Update:I finished the install back in June of this year (2013), and the product works very well the buzzer and the video feed is clear and the MICs work very well.  The video has a strange hue to it, some things are kind of lavender but I think it is a problem with the cable that has been buried for several years and the run is close to 200 feet.  If I could have I would have run new cable from the gates to the house but I did not have access to a ditch-witch at the time, maybe later.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "very good product", "Author": "carlos contreras", "ReviewID": "R105UAIUP7D2L6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is a very good product. hi quality video signal, i have to video cameras and both of them works very good.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice device for the price", "Author": "Ronni Silva", "ReviewID": "R1CBA8BFGXEIOV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: Price, protection around cameras, robust enough for outside gates usageCons: Wires provided could be of better quality and a bit longer, unless you leave in NYCity and your door\\gate is at the street edge.", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "7\" LCD HOME SECURITY VIDEO DOOR PHONE", "Author": "John Mc Neely", "ReviewID": "R3DHIM0EN29DK8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE UNIT IT IS UP AND RUNNING AND I COULD NOT ASK FOR A BETTER PICTURE IT IS GREAT.
