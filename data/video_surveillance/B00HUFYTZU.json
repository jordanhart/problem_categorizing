If you make your camera's available via the web domain people can browse the files on your computer! I haven't called Swann support yet to figure out WTF this is all about but I added a camera to the side of our house with a neighbor and found that they could browse any files on any of my hard drives by using the \"Browse\" button under \"configuration\".It would be great to hand out limited access to guests for say one camera, unfortunately I see nothing that stops them from accessing my local hard drives.==========The night vision when it is totally dark out is not that great on a large screen. I called support and they recommended plugging directly into the wall (not a power strip) and that helped a little. The resolution just pixelates way too much the larger you go. I've been viewing these mostly on a small monitor so I didnt notice this before. You can still make out what you are looking at, but to serve as evidence to get someone's face not gonna happen. Some of this is relative to the distance the camera's point of view. I have them covering my whole backyard, side of the house and front yard. If it was a smaller area the night vision would work better. But even in a large dark room you still get the same problem.I have a 3g android and it's not enough network bandwidth to run the camera's on the swann plus app. If I have it connected to a wifi source (namely my network at home) it works great. That is why I think it's a bandwidth issue.Everything else is working nicely.PSSince this system is expandable for up to 4 more camera's (8 in total) you could always pick up some higher resolution camera's for the areas you feel need it.---------update: Now that I've had the camera's out for a few weeks now I've noticed that on one camera the night vision gets pretty pixelated, It's still usable, but degraded. Night vision is black and white and looked great until a few days ago. The day time image is still fine though. It is getting cold here again and we might be getting snow. I'm not sure the cold would be doing this. However when I was screwing the camera up underneath the eves of the house I did squish the wire as it popped out of the groove it's supposed to be in. So make sure when you are installing the camera that the cord is in the groove before tightening it up all the way.This was not the case when I tested them indoors. Only outside, so maybe they dont do so well outside. I'll update if anything else changes. I'll call support soon to see if there is an adjustment I can make to fix this, but I doubt it.Also noteworthy is the fact that the screws that came with the camera were too large as if the holes on the camera platform were not big enough or drilled out to the proper size. I used a different screw that was galvanized as the ones they gave dont look to be.I used an extra long phillips head like 8\" long with my cordless drill to get the screws in without the camera impeding my ability to screw the platform in.-------------------------If you are like me and looking for the best system for the least amount of money you've found it here. I highly recommend this system to everyone looking at this level. You really get more than just bang for your buck.How often do you get quality items that meet or exceed expectations anymore?You know how you shop and read reviews to try to protect yourself, but until you get the thing in the mail and test it out you never know what will happen?That was me until today when I opened up this package and tested it out, then called support for details I needed to get it working. And you probably will too. It was about a 15 minute wait, but well worth it.I am a techy, I worked a software company for 8 years. All my friends and neighbors have me hooking up their wifi, wireless networks, etc. and I still had to call support for a few vital pieces of information.Number one thing is, this is a brand new system, even support acknowledged this, yet the software and firmware are solid. Amazing. Can't express how good and knowledgeable this tech support is and how solid this system seems to be so far. Both times I got cute oriental girls, but not with bad accents or anything. Again, amazing support.They offered to remote into my computer and just do it for me, but once we got through a couple of questions it was all done so no need.***(vital pieces of info were the ports for port forwarding. I am not adding them here for security reasons. If you are a techy, before they offer to remote pc, try asking for the ports first.)If you pass this one by you would be doing a great dis-service to yourself.However, this is made in China. Something to keep in mind when buying these days. Couldn't find an American made product with this value and I am still glad for my families safety that I bought it.", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Paid itself off within the first year.", "Author": "04 RSX", "ReviewID": "RYO07KM0A6Z5P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The system itself was very easy to install. You will need a drill to drill through whatever area you plan on mounting the cameras, as well as a safe place to store your blackbox. (You want to hide it, if a thief were to steal the box they would steal the evidence.)System has a nice online feature, so you can record everything to the internet if you connect it to your internet. Does not support Wi-Fi as far as I know.My only complaint is that the paint faded within about 6 months from a matte black to a rusted coppery color. (Doesn't seem like the cameras are rusting though.)This system paid for itself today, which is why I'm here writing the review. A neighbor plowed into my parked car and left a huge dent. The camera that caught it on film was about 50 feet away, but still caught the action clearly. You can even see the body of my car rock as they run into it. This will be solid evidence in case the neighbor decides to be uncooperative. (Keep in mind this was during broad daylight) I do recommend you spring for the higher end version, as the IR night quality is considerably better than the cheaper version. I own both versions and will not be purchasing the cheaper version again.Thanks Swann, you've really done your job.", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Michael Palazzola", "ReviewID": "R2RA65E6N3E4ZX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Much better image quality and user interface, then the REVO I have another property.

I still cannot monitor the cameras from my iPhone which was my primary reason for buying the system.5/30/2014Purchased the system from Amazon. When it arrived it appeared to be drop shipped from Costco. The tech support information included referred me to Costco. When I called Costco the tech could not help because I had purchased the system from Amazon. I was provided with Swann\u2019s tech support number. When I called it was an internal number to Apple. They had no idea what I was talking about!When I finally got in touch with Swann it was difficult for me to understand the tech. I tried to explain I had a MacBook Pro and the included instructions were useless to me. The included CD would not open and although I had the cameras working on a TV using the included HDMI cable I was unable to monitor the system on either my laptop or iPhone. Before I placed the call I booted an old PC and tried to install the software. The call was very frustrating and ended when the connection was lost. Later I received a VM from Swann trying to reestablish the dropped call.6/7/2014I called tech support a second time. I explained to the second tech what happened during the initial call and asked if MAC was supported. He said yes. This surprised me because the first tech either did not want to try to help with my MAC or didn\u2019t know it was supported. Utilizing Logmein123.com the second tech was able to download the MAC software, but was unable to install it because of my security settings. After several minutes I suggested that I might me able to finish the install and asked for a case number. We agreed if I could get the software installed and had future problems I would call back. I was able to install the software but unable to monitor the cameras from my MacBook Pro or iPhone.6/8/2014Called tech support for the third time. Provided the case number (TC623217) and spent an hour with the third tech who finally suggested I return the unit because he said the USB ports were not working. This would not allow me to connect the included mouse to set up the system. The cameras had been connected for at least 24 hours and were working fine. I was still unable to monitor from the MAC or iPhone. We concluded the call and I contacted Amazon. I requested a RA and was emailed a return label. I began disassembling the system for packaging and, as an after thought, rebooted the DVR. I booted fine and the mouse worked. If the tech had suggested a reboot it would have saved a lot of time! I am not computer savvy but I have found rebooting occasionally works. Now I have straighten out the RA I have because of the tech\u2019s suggestion.I called tech support for the fourth time, provided the case number and spent more time that I thought necessary explaining I didn\u2019t return the unit and the mouse was working. I suggested Logmein123.com and after the new tech took over the system he was able to get my MAC to monitor the cameras. I asked what the problem had been and was told when I changed the password (per the instructions) it \u201cdidn\u2019t take\u201d.At this point I am very uncomfortable with the operation of the system and have no idea that it will prove satisfactory. I am still unable to monitor on my iPhone, so I guess I\u2019ll have to call tech support again..Knowing what I now know I WOULD NOT have purchased this system. It certainly is not intuitive.", "Date": "June 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great entry level set up cameras", "Author": "richard hebert", "ReviewID": "R4BQ5IG2CSVBM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These are very clear cameras in their recording & footage services.
