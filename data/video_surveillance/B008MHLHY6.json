YAY.. its about time..The DVR comes without a fan in the case, So I had to add my own. Believe me you WANT the fan this sucker gets very hot without it.The cameras are VERY entry level. With the cmos camera, colors are a little out of sorts, the leaves on trees can be purple'ish or blue'ish and if you adjust the colors to fix that, whites turn slime green.. However, everything else in the camera view looks normal so it does not ruin or stop you from getting the footage you need.It is a wide view lens, So if someone is about 60+ feet away you wont see details of the persons face. However the image is a nice crisp image, and smooth..The night vision is not great at all and the LED's are much brighter then a better quality CCD camera with more LED's yet the amount of infrared light coming off this camera is less.. you will need some helper lights \"like a motion sensor light\" if you mount this camera outside.If you mount this camera inside and its a small to medium size room or a hallway you wont need extra light unless you have dark walls.Upgrading your video/power cable to something more professional is recommended, as the cables that come with this cause the video quality to drop and be a little fuzzy.I upgraded mine and noticed a visible difference.I hope this helped someone in a decision on this system.This is not a bad system, but if you need something for parking lots, or warehouse security buy better cameras.If you need this for inside, in rooms 25X25 or less, you will probably be satisfied.Also make sure you buy a Hard Drive rated for DVR's and not a computer or you will burn it up in 3 months like I did with my first two systems.a 1TB drive will hold about a month of video on best settings with this DVR.", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$499.99", "Features": "Instand email alert with photo if activity detected\nWhen everyone else is asleep, our cameras are watching closely\n24IR LEDs allow for 80ft automatic night vision\nThe metal housing is designed for indoors & outdoors use\nEmail Alert when motion detected", "Name": "ZMODO 8CH H.264 CCTV Security DVR System With 8 Outdoor Waterproof Security Camera - Not Hard Drive", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A5T1mdfyL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008MHLHY6"}}
