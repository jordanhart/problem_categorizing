{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Well built, very capable, well supported, feature rich, stable IP camera.", "Author": "Schundg \"Schundg\"", "ReviewID": "R1SVHXDQD0THIQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In August, 2013 I installed the Trivision NC-336W (w/o POE) and have been using it on my wireless network without any trouble at all.  It is a very well built camera.  The camera is a bit heavy but that's because it's made from quality materials.  The mount is the best and most sturdy I have found on any camera.Though this camera is an outdoor bullet camera, I have it mounted inside my garage door window to keep it hidden and therefore I am unable to use Infared night vision.  I enjoy excellent night vision using 2 (40w equivalent led bulbs in ) coach lights mounted outside my 3 garage doors.  Daytime vision is excellent (even through a garage door window).  The camera automatically adjusts to brightness/darkness.  I have had no trouble with wireless drop outs, camera failures, or any other trouble.  The camera is in my attached garage about 50' from my router which is in my home.  This camera is rock solid stable and delivers a great picture even connected to a wireless network.  Bandwidth usage is low due to video compression.  I enjoy 12 frames/second (FPS) at 1080P daytime viewing and 7 FPS @ 1080P night vision.The Trivision accepts an SD card for recording storage though I have not used that feature.  I have this camera connected to Blue Iris DVR software (Ourstanding Software) and use BI software to control motion detection sensitivity, motion masking, recording, email notifications, etc.  There are plenty of features included in this camera like email notifications, recording on trigger, motion sensing, motion masks, night vision control, IR control, Audio record, video record, SD card storage, File Transfer, and 2 way audio which requires a (not included) speaker at the camera.I have contacted Trivision support both pre and post purchase and have received outstanding support.  They are very timely (overnight, usually because they're in China) and through in their support.  I arranged for a technician to log into my camera and make some initial adjustments as this was my first camera and I had no experience whatsoever.  I contacted their support later and asked about a firmware upgrade which they sent to me.  A web site would be very helpful which they say they are creating, but I have not found it operational  as of Nov, 4, 2013.The camera is a bit pricey but you get what you pay for.  My next purchase will include the PoE feature which is not possible with the NC-336W ... Note: to get the PoE feature, you need to purchase the NC-336WP.", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Apparently new model not ready for prime time", "Author": "John G. Frykman \"jfrykman\"", "ReviewID": "R14RLRO3HY7KK3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My first reaction to this camera on opening the package, and in reviewing the very complete instructions were very positive.  It has many advanced capabilities, and the picture quality (at least over ethernet) is extraorinarily good.As I always do with technical products, I read the installation and operation instructions thoroughly before I began the installation.  Everything went very smoothly, until I got to trying to get it to work in wireless mode.  The software walks you through the setup process, and you can test the operation as you go along.The installation for the wireless is very straightforward, and one that I am used to as I have a number of wireless devices on my 802.11n wireless router.  When I got to the place where the wireless setup was tested, the response was that the wireless option had been configured properly.  However, when I viewed the setup tear sheet, it indicated that wireless was NOT connected.  The instructions state that you must remove the ethernet connection for the wireless option to work.  Fine.  But when you remove the ethernet connection, NOTHING works.  The only way you can get the camera to work at all is to reconnect the ethernet cable and reboot the camera.After trying this process a half dozen times, carefully following the instructions all the way, the camera still refuses to operate in wireless mode.So I resort to the technical support, explaining my difficulty in my email and stating clearly that I had reset the camera several times to factory default and the wireless refuses to function.  The reply I got, in about an hour, was to send back the contents of the tear sheet, and suggested that I may not have run setup again!  (Rather obviously necessary after resetting to default factory settings!)Anyway, it has been 7 hours since my response and my email has yet to be acknowledged, let alone responded to.  This is supposedly \"expedited\" tech support?I will have to say, in fairness, this comment at this point is the lack of any real support.  It looks as though the email came from China, so maybe the tech guy went home for the weekend.  I'm also critical of the fact that the manual only suggests checking for a valid IP address or password.  That should not be necessary since the system already stated that the wireless was working!  I am not happy.I will update this if and when tech support responds and if the response remedies the problem.UPDATE:I was able to resolve the issue with the help of Mr. O'Connor's helpful comment.  I'm not sure how common this issue is, but the documentation that came with the camera was of no help at all.  The tech support is dodgy at best, since you cannot telephone them (they are in China) and have the tech support people walk you though the issue.  The camera is great, and it connects very easily through 3 walls and 50 feet of air with my 802.11n wireless router.That said, I would not advise anyone who is not somewhat technically savvy on wireless network setup to buy this camera.  I spent a good 20 hours of experimenting with different network setups before I resolved the problem without any real assistance from TriVision tech support.  Emails are no real help with complex issues such as the one I experienced.I would have rated the camera 5 stars were it not for the minimal tech support.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$499.00", "Features": "High Definition HD 1080p Video-------------The Bullet HD1080 delivers crisp High Definition 1080p video images.
