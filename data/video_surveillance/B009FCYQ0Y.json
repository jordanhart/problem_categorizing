{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Low Light Quality w/Wide Angle Lens.", "Author": "tomg", "ReviewID": "RA9A8SR4ZBA2S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The LG LW130W (LG) is one of the new batch of inexpensive \u201cOnvif\u201d compatible, multi-stream, H.264,  IP cameras which can output 720P images at reasonable frame rates\u2026mostly for surveillance uses.  The LG camera is similar in basic features to the  Panasonic BL-VP104(w) and BL-VT164(w)  (104/164) which I currently use with a VioStor VS208Pro for security.  I have added a LW130W (LG) into my 6 camera system\u2026here\u2019s what I found out. Like the Panasonic 104/164, you need to use a PC and the MS IE browser for setup.  There is provisions to set up the LG directly with a wireless router using WPS, one button setup, but I don\u2019t do wireless.  In any case, viewing and detail configuration of the camera  also needs to done with MS IE, so it looks like the same situation as the Panasonic 104/164 cameras\u2026.no MAC OS support.The LG camera has no physical PTZ, but will do it electronically.  It has a wide angle lens with noticeable fisheye.  The LG does have a built in mic, speaker, buzzer sound, LED light (for stills and video to help with low light) and 3 LED indicators on the front (that don\u2019t seem to be able to be turned off\u2026unlike the Panasonics).  The setup features seems to all be there (but not as many setup items and details as with the Panasonic 104/164).  The LG also has both motion and IR detection.However, the big advantage of the LG is it\u2019s performance in low light which is far superior to the Panasonic 104/164.  Of course, the LG won\u2019t see in the dark without turning on it\u2019s front mounted LED (which it can do when it senses IR/Motion).Like the newer Panasonic 104/164, the LG is OnVif compliant, which should make it compatible with the new batch of NVR\u2019s coming out of China.  However, getting these cameras to work dependably with NVRs is not always that easy\u2026I have had lots of issues with my VioStor NVR and these inexpensive 720P cameras.Given enough light, both the Panasonic 104/164 and the LG cameras put out a great picture at 720p compared with the older 640x480 surveillance cameras.  I\u2019m not that impressed with electronic PTZ.  I guess I\u2019ll have to wait for someone to come out with an optical zoom with physical Pan/Tilt  720p camera for under $300.  Till then, I will be replacing a couple of the Panasonics (104/164) in stiuations that have low light with LGs.", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera w/ Great Image Quality", "Author": "Les Reeder", "ReviewID": "R1XJAT0QXO62QK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought 3 of these cameras to install in our new paint shop (we're a Chevrolet dealer) and I'm happy to say we'll be buying more for other parts of the dealership. If I had to say anything bad about them it would be that the \"DVR\" software that comes with them is not that easy to install, especially the pro version. The documentation for the software is almost nonexistant. Once you figure it out though, it works great.", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Horrible", "Author": "J.
