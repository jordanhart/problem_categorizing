{"Reviews": [{"Title": "not auto object tracking", "Author": "tory j hargis", "ReviewID": "R2IDVRRHOBREZZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera sold by Ansice CCTV cam is not an auto tracking camera.  Ordered 2 cameras listed as 6\" size, they are larger than the 7\" ptz cameras they were to replace.  Both cameras sold with auto tracking listed on the description and on the box have no auto tracking menu as described in the owners manual or anywhere in the on screen display menu.  Camera video looks like 500 tvl compared to my other 500 and 700 tvl cameras.  BUYER BEWAREUpdate:  Was able to talk seller into sending me only 1 of the correct camera but should have been two as that is what I ordered.  Seller also told me this would be replacement without return and to keep the camera I didnt need. After receiving new camera they start asking me how i was going to pay for the camera I didnt need, so it will be going back.  The 1 camera that was sent as a correction is a good camera, good video quality looks like 700 tvl to me, good ir night vision, and auto tracking works pretty well.  4 star for camera 2 for seller.", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GQWO16A"}}
