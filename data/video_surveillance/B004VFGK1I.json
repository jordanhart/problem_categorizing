{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent value and good customer service", "Author": "David Peppard", "ReviewID": "R1CBAUWXNJ96FH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We ordered this unit on March 19, 2012.  We love it!  I started the installation process on March 24th, and have four of the eight cameras installed and running.  The system has been running just fine for this last week.  I had no problems getting things setup; most of it worked right out of the box.  I am quite technical, so setting up the remote access via a web browser, and Android mobile app worked on the first try.  As long as you know how to forward ports on your home router, the remote access process will be very easy.Some things to note.  Make sure you PLAN your install ahead of time.  Camera location, cable runs, DVR location, and access into your house for the cabling are key.  Take your time.  Time and planning up front will pay off big time in the long run.  I pre-planned everything I thought I would need before I started installing.  I had made a trip to Home Depot the day before, and unboxed and tested the system on the kitchen table before I started installing anything.  All the cameras worked just fine during the test, as did the DVR.Make sure you measure your runs for your cameras and order extra cables before hand.  I had one cable run that ended up being about four feet short.  I had to order a couple extra cables so I could run cable cleanly to the cameras.  The 60 foot cables may sound long when you are first installing, but as soon as you start routing cables, 60 feet runs out very quickly.  It is nice to have a couple 100 foot cables on hand, and they are inexpensive to order.I spent 8.5 hours straight installing in the first four cameras and DVR.  I initially had three cameras installed in front of our house, but decided I didn't have all the coverage I wanted, so I installed a fourth on the front of our house.  I took plenty of time to find the location I wanted to bring the cabling into our house from, so I didn't drill through any electrical, studs, or any other items that may block my path or damage the house.I reviewed three different manufacturers: Swann, Q-See, and XModo.  Some key items that made my decision to go with Swann where the fact that the cameras were:* Camera lenses were 3.6mm over 6mm.  3.6mm lenses provide a wider viewing angle over 6mm.* Camera Image sensor technology is CCD in the Swann, not CMOS (more info here for tech junkies: [...]). CCD provides for a clearer picture and is less susceptible to \"noise\" interference from the night vision LEDs, making for better picture quality all around (is how I understood it from the article I linked).* Cameras were branded as Sony with the Swann system.  I like Sony.  I did not see any specific branding on any of the other systems.* Customer service answered their phone.  Before purchasing I called the customer service/tech support line to see what kind of experience I would have.  Someone who spoke solid English answered after only one minute on hold.  I since have called customer service two more times to get clarification on a couple things, and both times my hold time was only one to two minutes.Some other things to note.  Email notifications only work if you have the camera in 'scheduled' motion detection mode.  Even though the cameras will sense motion triggers while 'always recording' they will not send notifications unless the camera is NOT in 'always record' mode, and is in 'scheduled' mode with \"alarm\" parameters set in the schedule.  After messing with this, I decided I preferred the 'always record' mode.I immediately took out the 500GB hard drive and upgraded to a 2TB drive.  This was easy.  The only thing I had to do was get into the DVR menu and format the hard drive from the DVR menu before the DVR would start recording again.  This is not noted in the documentation for replacing the hard drive, so be aware you need to use the DVR menu to format any replacement drive you put in before the device will start recording to it.  Format only took a couple minutes for the 2TB drive.You can perform about 90% of the DVR setup and function through the web interface.  Currently only Internet Explorer is supported (I prefer Chrome or Firefox), but I had no trouble using IE 7 on a Windows XP machine, or IE 9 on my Windows 7 machine after following the IE configuration changes in the Swann documentation.  You must make a couple security changes (nothing that will jeopardize your computer) to make the Swann Active X plug in install and work correctly.I used the remote a little bit.  The main interface on the DVR is a little clunky with the remote.  I prefer to use the web interface when at all possible.  The mouse that is included is also clunky when I have used it.  I will likely change out the mouse to see if something better works more smoothly, but I have not done that yet.Night vision works great for us.  We have perimeter lighting completely around our house.  Our motion lights are on the  'dusk till dawn' setting and greatly enhance the night vision ability of these cameras.Lastly, if you do enable remote access, make sure you change your passwords and document them.  Be aware if you call customer service they may want to remote into your DVR using the remote web interface.  You will have to give them your user name and password.  Make sure you change your password afterward, and update your notes.We are very happy with this system so far.  It has all the bells and whistles we wanted, replacement parts are available for every aspect, and customer service actually answer their phone and answer questions.  The remote access and Android app are very cool.  We hope this system will perform for years, and hope it will for you too.I hope this information helps others.  Best of luck.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Great System For The Money", "Author": "Steve D", "ReviewID": "R3BSJACVQ25JOS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far, this system has met all of my expectations ... and more.  It was easy to set up and it is recording 24/7 video for us with no issues.  I am really impressed with how Swann has made this such a complete, ready to go, system.  I had two cameras recording and being displayed on the TV within 20 minutes of opening the box.  Of course I had not yet routed the wiring yet for proper camera placement and properly hiding of the wires.  Note, this is by far the most time consuming and frustrating element to setting up a security system, but that is not the fault of this system.  (For allot more money you can buy a wireless system.)The only negative I have is the ability to configure the system so that I can achieve remote monitoring, ie a iphone or ipad.  The issue is that the Mac Airport Extreme Router does not support the UpNP interface that this system requires.  Swann's documentation says that there is alternate hope, but it appears very complex (they even say this) and I think beyond my IT/network capability.  I hope to figure it out, but it is not mission critical.On the good side, the night vision performance is very good, the day light performance is great, the 4 camera display on the TV or computer monitor is excellent, and the system settings configurability is very extensive.  Example, instead of recording at 30 fps I changed it to 1 fps so to save hard drive space and thus be able to capture many more days of history before it starts over-writing old data.  I did try the motion detection feature.  It seemed to work well, but I've opted for 27/7 capture at 1 fps.  The ability to review history is pretty slick and very easy to understand.  The remote is a bit clumsy, but using the mouse is very efficient.Summary:  I am very pleased to be in a 4 camera, night vision, 500 GB DVR, continuous recording surveillance system for $250.I'd say the only thing to watch out for is if you absolutely require \"smart phone\" viewing that you prepare for challenging IT/Network tinkering.  Maybe it will be easy on a UpNP capable router.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Camera system purchased so far", "Author": "Woody1", "ReviewID": "RH6O16UU32RS5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this system about 4 months ago.  It was to replace the latest in my attempt to be cheap for a system, Harbor Freight was my latest system of disaster.  These cameras and DVR unit are far Superior, have simplistic straight forward setups and are very feature rich.  The fact the camera angles are 62 degrees is more than a plus.  If they don't tell you what the field of view is, just keep on looking because most are around 34 degrees and are horrible for view and color/contrast.  These cameras are easy to install or can be professionally installed by Swann contractors. The DVR has yet to have a glitch and has been running on top of a hot Cable box the whole time.  IR distance is 65+ feet which is great since most cameras are mounted under the second story eve. Greens are green, blues are blue, reds are red and my dog is not a pixel shadow creature any more.Update 2/20/13Not a single issue to date and the system has been on 24x7 for almost two years.  I have a UPS on the system and it's never been unplugged.  Camera optics are just as clear as day one.  I have had to remove some spider webs 3x over this period.  Upon my inspection I have noticed the black housing has turned a golden color.  No pitting or rust but like shiny brass underneath.  I live in the Midwest were we get some pretty crappy weather and wind.  These cameras are in the full elements or rain, ice, snow and direct sun. Mounts have held firm for all this time and that's incredibly important as I would have to drag out a 32' 100lb ladder.  I check the system 10-15 times a day just to see my dog, front door, back door, fence gates and driveway.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent product but the jury is out on customer service", "Author": "E. Schaefer \"reading addict\"", "ReviewID": "R3HB0V94BIHZS1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "PRODUCT: THREE STARSAssuming that we get the two damaged cameras back with no further problems (see customer service), the system is not bad deal overall, but not really a great deal either. The set up instructions are clear and the included wiring is enough for what most people will need. The software is a bit clunky and we are still playing around with it, it works albeit less cleanly than you'd like. Reviewing video is a chore unless you have a specific time in mind. The cameras appear to be an older model camera. The ones that are not defective seem to work fine. If all of the cameras had come in working properly, it would be closer to a 3.5 star system.CUSTOMER SERVICE: INCOMPLETE (BUT SO FAR DISAPPOINTING)We tested all of the wires and equipment before running any wires. Which was a good thing since one of the cameras was DOA. So we contacted customer service to set up a replacement.(The instructions clearly tell you not to return to the store, but to contact customer service-I now which we had just re-boxed and done a return through Amazon.) They told us they would send us an RMA to return the defective camera, and to go ahead and set up the others. So we did.We had to call them back to get an RMA because they didn't send one as promised. Then when we took it in to get it returned and realized they didn't give us a shipping label. Upon further review they require that the Buyer pays for return shipping until it is 'proven' that you bought the item less than 30 days ago. Just as we get ready to send it in, a second camera fails. So now we are down 2 out of three. We are now past the 30 days and still have not received the replacements.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Swann", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RK6D6LCAA7QI7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've tried several different brands for security cameras over the years.

The installation process is not easy but you have to be very patient on where you want to put each camera. Read the manual and start unrolling your cable...again be very patient. My husband worked outside the house armed with his cellphone, while I'm inside the house looking at the monitor. We communicate back and forth to which angle to positon the camera.

This is NOT a top of the line security DVR. If you expect that then you should expect to pay much more. A high quality 8 camera system with high quality cameras is going to cost more like $3000.00. Cameras can easily be $100-$150 each and up. This system is designed for basic video security and mostly for the average home user. For the price, you are getting what you paid for and it should be very suitable for most home users. I have not had this long and I have 5 cameras installed. They are all working fine in full color. I used the cables that came with the system with the exception of one where I needed a longer cable. The hookup is fairly simple. The DVR interface is not completely intuitive but is manageable. I have mine all setup to record only when motion is detected. I bought a Netgear wireless adapter and plugged it in so I could have it accessible from anywhere. I have the SwannView loaded on my iPhone and iPad and I can access from anywhere. This really wasn't hard to set up. Again, it is not elaborate but it serves the function that it is intended to do.Overall I got what I expected.

Brown \"Technology Consultant\"", "ReviewID": "R30U15QXIEO0H2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wish I could give this a \"zero' star.While searching for a home surveillance system, I ran across the Swann products. Most reviews on Amazon have been positive so I put this particular system at the top of my list.While preparing to order, I searched around the internet and found many many negative reviews about Swann products (as well as others like Lorex, Q-See and other systems targeted at home users).  These reviews, made by people 'in the industry' were all very negative towards all these home systems. At first glance, I listened to these reviews but I eventually started ignoring them thinking that these 'professionals' were more interested in selling higher-end systems than providing real quality reviews of DIY systems.I should have listened to these other reviews.I ordered this system after weighing the pros/cons of using a full IP based system over a more traditional CCTV system.  The fact that this system (and others) have a DVR, smartphone viewing and other features pulled me toward the CCTV approach.I received the order the next day (I love Amazon's service...top notch).  I immediately pulled the system out and started connection it up to test it out.  I was immediately disappointed.The build quality of the DVR is poor.  The BNC connectors on the back almost ripped out of the back of the cheap aluminum backing when connecting a few cameras to test. The BNC cables that came with the system are ridiuclously thin and cheap (and it appears that there is a lot of image quality loss along the cables...or just really poor cameras).After I connected 3 cameras, I connected the DVR to my TV to get a feel for the image quality. I was really disappointed.  The  quality was bad. Real bad. Strike 1.Thinking that perhaps the quality I was seeing was due more to my TV than the system, I wanted to view the cameras via my computer and iPhone using the Swannview products. I downloaded the Swannview iPhone app and, after setting up my port forwarding on my local network and testing that it works, I tried to view the cameras.  Nothing. the iPhone app doesn't work (and many people have said as much on the iPhone app reviews).  Strike 2.Finally, I tried to use my PC browser to view the cameras.  IUsing my browser, I visited the IP address of the DVR and was then told to download viewer. Using the Chrome browser on a PC, the system tries to make me download a Mac application. Using Internet Explorer (IE), the system tries to make me download an ActiveX control - that will not install due to security settings in IE.  Rather than futz with IE (I don't use it anyway), I switched over to my Mac Mini to view the cameras. After installing the Mac viewer, I was finally able to view the DVR and cameras....and was horrified by the quality of the images.  Strike 3.3 Strikes and your out Swann. This system is being returned to Amazon for a refund. I should have listened to the negative reviews around the web.A note on the camera setup while test:I set the cameras up 10 feet from my desk and pointed all three at the desk and my chair so that my face would be in all three.  With all three approaches above (TV, iPhone and Desktop), I couldn't see any identifying features in my own face. That right there is bad cameras. From 10 feet, I should be able to identify myself.This system may be OK for anyone wanting to keep an eye on things around their house, but if you ever need to actually identify people to law enforcement, I doubt you'll be able to with these cameras.", "Date": "June 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Meh...", "Author": "Amy Michelle", "ReviewID": "R26W0RWGYB6HBM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall a decent product for the price. Fairly straightforward plug & play type setup, requires only a minimal amount of technical know-how to get up and running. The most difficult part for us was running the cables neatly along the outside of the house, through the attic and down in to the wall. It should be noted that these cameras provide a wide-angle view, which we really like, however the downside to this is things appear farther away then they really are. The picture resolution leaves a lot to be desired as well. The company touts these as high-res cameras but they are anything but. A word of caution: unless your subject is within about arms-reach of the lens you will have a difficult time making out any distinguishing features of your perp. Most people walking alongside of our house (about 8 feet from the camera) are only identifiable by the color of the clothes they are wearing. Oddly enough, the night-vision picture is typically alot clearer than the daylight video we get off of these. Also it's worth mentioning that I live in the Silicon Valley, am an A+ certified technician and have worked diagnosing, troubleshooting and fixing complex technical & network issues for several years at a large corporation. Despite all of this, and after 3 whole days of working at a solution, I have been so far unsuccessful in getting any of the internet/mobile viewing stuff functioning with my setup. Just a heads up, if your internet router is not UPNP compatible, you're in for one hell of a ride. Swann claims it is still possible to configure without UPNP but I have had zero luck with the port forwarding option. When I called tech-support I was put on hold for 10 minutes, then given the option to leave a message for someone to call me back. I left 2 messages and I didn't receive a call back either time. Finally I called a third time, waited through the annoying automated system for 30 minutes before a kindly Indian gentleman picked up. I asked if he could walk me through the network setup of my new Swann security system and he assured me he could and began asking questions about my cable-modem and router. I gave him the model numbers on both and he told me he would be emailing me instructions on how to configure the system with my specific router as soon as we hung up. It has been 8 hours since I spoke to him and no such instructions have yet arrived at my email box. I even spelled my email address out phonetically for him and double checked that he had it correct. Nothing in the Spam folder either. What a huge disappointment. I will probably get this working at some point, but I will likely have to buy a new router and waste another 9 or 10 hours of my life screwing with it.

When you call, you're left on hold literally for hours before someone answers, if someone answers at all.  Sometimes, the outgoing message will even say that their help desk is closed, when the hours dictate that they should be open.  I also tried their online live chat help and 3 times after 15 minutes of waiting for someone to connect with me to help there, they disconnect me from that, too.  So then I resort to emailing for help.

I was able to get the system up and running on two different networks (home and work) without too much effort.

The iPhone app has a bug but worked great once I figured out a workaround (see below).I like this system a lot and am already thinking about upgrading to an 8 camera system.DVR + Camera Setup---It took about 5 mins to get the dvr and cameras plugged in and working in my home office.  The DVR interface is intuitive and it did not take long to set up a recording schedule, configure alerts and email notifications, and play back recorded video.Camera quality is decent considering the price of the package.  Don't expect to make out details like faces or license plates beyond 8-10 feet.  Night vieweing is better than expected.  The DVR is very quiet.Viewing Cameras on the Network---***TIP: Swann has instructional setup videos on their website. I recommend watching these before setting up network viewing.After reviewing the Swann videos and installing the NetViewer application provided on the included disc I was able to access the cameras on the local network without any changes to my router.  I was not able to access via Internet Explorer due to Active X permission issues. Since I had access with the NetViewer application I did not spend any time getting the Internet Explorer viewing interface working.On my home network I was also able to view the cameras from the external IP address using the NetViewer application without any router setting changes (UPnP enabled).Setting up the network viewing at my work location was a bit trickier as I had to do port forwarding and assign the DVR a fixed IP on the local network (router was not UPnP enabled).  This would have been frustrating for someone with little or no IT knowledge.iPhone Viewing (Bug Workaround)---I have an iPhone 4 so I installed the free SwannView application from the iTunes app store.  Like other people I was unable to connect and received a \"user or password error\" when attempting to view cameras.  I knew the IP, password and username were correct because they worked on the NewViewr app from my PC.***BUG Workaround:  After several hours of trying different things I was able to get the SwannView iPhone application to work by only entering the first six characters of the password (I had changed the admin password to a longer, more secure password when setting up the DVR).Accessing Cameras via a Fixed Domain Name (Using Dynamic DNS)---In order to access the cameras remotely using a domain name I set up an account with DynDNS.com.  Setting up the DynDNS account and configuring the DVR to use dynamic DNS took about 10 mins.  DynDNS has a free 14 day trial and there is no charge if you only need a single dynamic IP.

One at my house and one at my elderly in-laws so we can keep an eye on things at their place. I must say that the hardest part was reading all the reviews about how hard the system was to set up or how poor the picture quality was. After reading all these type of reviews I was very leery about the unit until l realized the constant theme to me were probably people who have troubles with simple pc operation and have very little home maintenance ability and did not take the time to read the owner\u2019s manual. If you are technically challenged hire someone and don\u2019t blame the product for your inabilities. Have the high school kid down the street set up the network settings for you and show you how to change the password and do so. I will admit if you want to see the video on your smart phone setting up your router will confuse a lot of people. For the people who complain about the color quality, \u201cit\u2019s adjustable\u201d. I simply set a white board (my granddaughters easel) with the primary colors and a white stripe on the paper about 10 feet away and adjusted. People look at the picture\u2019s on our smart phones and think we have a HD broad casting station set up at the house\u2019s it is that good. For the people who can do minor house repairs this system should be a breeze for you to install, but do as I did. Make a plan. I made a drawing (very ruff) of the house in a notebook, than I put an \u201cX\u201d at each location that I wanted a camera with the ruff angle (38 degrees) of what it would see. Think about how to route the cable and where you are willing to drill the needed 5/8\u201d holes to get the cable through the wall and how you will cover that hole up after. Every camera overlaps another camera on the outside of my house and I can see every door/window as well as down the street. If you think the 60 foot cables might not be enough length order a 4 pack of the hundred footers. I routed my cables so they are well hidden and put the DVR in a location that would take anyone wishing to grab it a good ten minutes to locate and 5 more minutes to get to (I had a neighbor try). I also have a few of the cameras sending emails to an account when motion is triggered. Reading the manual well before setting up the system so you will understand what each menu item does was a big help. If you order the system go to the web site and download the manual and read it in advance. I would have probably missed how to clear up the picture by adjusting the color had I not took the time to read the manual. You will have to have a monitor hooked to the unit to make the color and a few other adjustments but you can take it off if you wish after everything is set to how you like it. I put a cheap lcd monitor on it and added a 25 foot cable between it and the unit and routed the vga cable out of site. It shows a rotating picture from all 8 cameras. You cannot adjust the color from the local pc on the network via the software supplied. Also the Android and iPhone app is a little confusing at first so you will have to play around to get the images you want displayed at start up of the app. You can see all 8 cameras but only 4 at a time or one on a blown up screen. The Windows phone app only shows one camera at a time and you just select which one you would like to see. Also I did read one review about how you could not make out people\u2019s faces very well. I do agree with this assessment with one thing I would like to point out. Go to the local convenience store and look at the quality of the pictures the security system gets. This is very much in line with that quality. If you want a system that can perfectly make out objects/people you will need to spend a lot more money to get cameras that can zoom, tilt/pan and a security person to operate it because this is a fixed focal point system. This system is a deterrent that also gives piece of mind and is worth every penny I spent. Sorry I did not use the tech support at Swann so can not speak to that.", "Date": "June 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best bang for buck", "Author": "Patrick D. Bostwick", "ReviewID": "R1R960EX0TU1KG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to secure my home and so far I couldn't be happier.  Initial setup wasn't too bad, I ran into a few problems along the way but their tech support was always there willing to go the extra mile to help me solve my problems during setup.  I haven't setup all 8 cameras yet however I can say that I have no regrets in choosing Swann for my home security.  I will update my review a month later after I've had more time to get used to the setup.Update (08/06/12): I contacted tech support about a few issues I was having and decided to include the problem and solution in my review.*Open Telnet: Yes the device does have an open telnet port, but the only way to access it is using the admin account on your Swann system.  If you set the password there is no way someone can log into your device without the proper password.  Another reviewer was upset about this but telnet is only a security issue when you use it and someone on your network is snooping.  The same could be said about using your web browser without ssl to access the web interface of the device.  Solution, set admin password don't use telnet :)*Invalid User on Mobile Device: This happens if you are trying to use an account other than admin.  You must set the admin password and login to your device using the admin account only.  This bothers me a little bit as I would like to set specific privileges for a separate account but regardless it works with this solution so I am happy.*Is it possible to delete segments or video files from DVR: This is not possible using the DVR interfaces.  To delete footage using the DVR you must format the hard drive completely.  It is probably possible to remove the hard drive and attach it to a computer to delete the individual video file however by the time someone has gone through that amount of effort it will hopefully be obvious that someone has been tampering with your device.*Always record with motion detect: I initially wanted my device setup so that I could have footage of everything but still have the luxury of searching by motion detection to skip footage where nothing happens.  I guess I was being paranoid because I now realize that the device does a good job at catching everything it needs to with motion detect alone.  However if you do find yourself still wanting motion detection + constant recording the solution I was given was to setup motion detection as you normally would and once you are done hit the record button on the front of the DVR.  It will now alternate between constant recording and motion detection as needed.  You will see a red \"R\" on the screen if it is recording without detecting motion and a red \"M\" if it is recording while detecting motion.*How far can I run cables: The answer I was given was 300ft is the max before you start running into issues.  I'm assuming this is due to the power supply and it may be possible to run longer cables if needed using a stronger power supply however I think 300ft for a home security system will meet most users needs.  I couldn't find precut cable longer than 150ft and needed some lines to be 250FT for clean wiring, so I opted to buy 1000FT and crimp my own cables.  Still waiting for the rest of my supplies to arrive however I don't imagine I will have any problems.  Will update again once I'm done.*What is the maximum size hard drive supported: 2TB", "Date": "August 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "3 Months In...", "Author": "JStreck", "ReviewID": "R15B1RK3B01OJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I decided to use this system for a while before providing feedback.  After about 3 months of 24/7 use, the system is performing well.The Bad:Out of the box, I discovered a dead cable for which I immediately contacted Swann customer service.  They instructed me to simply email them with a copy of my invoice/receipt for the system (purchased through Amazon), with a description of the problem.  After sending 3 different emails over the last several weeks, I've yet to receive a response.  I have not yet called customer service back.  Fortunately, I was able to source a quick replacement cable for little money through Amazon in the interim.The picture quality is mediocre at best.  The cameras are supposed to be full color, but they rarely display in color.  95% of the time the image is in grainy black and white regardless of lighting conditions (I've tried full natural light, partial natural light, total darkness, full synthetic light, and partial synthetic light).  It doesn't seem to matter.  The color adjustments through the DVR are of no use either.The DVR interface is decent, though the remote control could be improved.  Even with new batteries the remote doesn't seem to communicate with the DVR very well - I notice I have to press the buttons numerous times with greater than average pressure to get them to respond.  The DVR is only about 6-7 ft. from my couch.Aiming the cameras is difficult, as the setscrews intended to lock their position are laughable at best.  I've had to reposition one of the cameras numerous times, and had to compromise on its position due to limitations in locking it into place where I want it - the set screws come loose and the camera moves.  Also, the cameras have little shades that are supposed to slide back and forth to cover the lenses from direct light - they are extremely difficult to slide.  I thought I was going to break one of the cameras just trying to move the shade about an inch.The cables are fragile - I somehow damaged two of them while tacking them to the wall, though I have yet to determine where the damage occurred.  I can't find any point where the cable insulation was compromised or kinked - they just stopped working.I have not yet figured out how to get the motion feature to work so that the cameras only record when motion is detected.  As of now, the system is recording 24/7.I have not yet tried to setup the email feature to receive alert detection notifications.  I'll add that to my review when/if I set that up and test it.The Good:The system was easy to set up, and required little effort to fine tune.  The 65' cables are sufficiently long to cover my 3 story 1500 sq. ft. home with the DVR in a central location.Networking was a little more involved than I anticipated, as I had to forward the ports for viewing over the internet and on my phone.  Thankfully, a brief Google/YouTube search provided all the information I needed to assist with this.  I had the system configured with two phones and 5 computers setup for remote viewing in just a couple of hours.  The Android app is great, but only offers live viewing - there's no option that I can find for reviewing recordings on my phone (original HTC EVO 4G).  The web application, however, does provide full functionality.  The interface is easy and straightforward using a PC.  The only drawback is that it is only supported in Internet Explorer, so you Firefox, Chrome, etc. users are out of luck unless you use IE to view your system.The playback is good, with great options for indexing and searching.Overall, this is a good entry-level system for the general user.  The networking portion is not so easy, but with a little knowledge, some patience, and access to Google/YouTube it's not too bad.  The cameras could be improved, but for the money, Swann delivers a good system for simple home/small business monitoring.", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "fantastic for the money - some small issues", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2A29LXTB38Z5O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "1.) installationprior to installing the camera or routing any wires i quickly connected everything to make sure it all works. i had zero issues. The box comes with a manual and a quick setup guide. the system is so easy to set up i did not even look at the manual or guide and got everything working within minutes.the camera come with their own dry wall screws and mounts. they were complete garbage IMO. i instead used some nicer ones i already had.prior to actually drilling holes or anything i held the cameras in place with my hand and had my fiance tell me how to adjust them so we could see what we wanted. this was hard and time consuming since we wanted to make sure we has no blind spots. but this is required for any camera system. actually drilling the holes for the screws and everything was easy using a small marker to mark the three mounting hole locations on the wall.routing the wires was by far the hardest and most time consuming part. but this once again is how any wired camera system would be. the supplied length of cable was more than enough for my needs. if needed i could always buy extensions.make sure to pick a place for the DVR that is hidden. you do not want the DVR next to all your other entertainment system hardware. if a thief breaks into your home, that would be some of the first things they would steal. it does no good to record someone stealing your stuff if they also steal the recording.2.) configurationyou have three options to control the DVR, (though during initial setup you only have two) one is with the supplied USB mouse, one is with the supplied IR remote, and the other is over the network once that is set up.until i had the network setup and working i liked the remote the most.configuration was easy and straight forward. the menu settings are fairly self explanatory, and i only once and while looked at the manual for assistance. i thought the manual had all the detail required to get the unit working.some people have said they had difficulty in getting the remote access working. my router supported the required protocols as the manual detailed. using the site whatismyip.com i was able to determine my router's public IP. knowing the port i configured the DVR to use per the manual, i was first able to get something to load on my machine. for one reason or another i could only see the HTML source code of the web page!. luckily i have done web development and read the source code. the page i was looking at was a re director page determining what browser you were using. based on that it would send you to the right HTML page. with IE it would send me to [...] where the x's represent my public IP address(please note it appears this remote access only seems to work with IE or saffari. i tried firefox, chrome, and maxthon browsers and none worked). for one reason or another if i only entered the IP and port info into my browser i could not access the web interface. however after manually typing in the play.html after my IP and port i was asked to install an active x plug in and everything worked fine!through the web interface you can see live video of the 4 cameras, see your past recordings, and configure nearly all settings within the DVR. for me everything worked except for the playback of recorded video. i kept getting an error. this was a little disappointing. i like that i can configure everything through the web interface so i do not need to worry about running the RCA cable from the DVR to a TV.3.) video qualityfor the money and based on the number of TV lines the cameras posses, the video quality is exactly what i expected. for the money i was not expecting full 1080P resolution recording. if you want that kind of video quality you are looking at many times more money. you can always upgrade the cameras to ones with more lines of resolution such as cameras with 540 lines or more. for my use i am happy with the video quality. i have watched those TV shows of criminals recorded on video. police have been able to arrest people with video much worse than what these camera do, so i am not concerned with not being able i identify anyone breaking into my house.4.) miscthe cameras automatically switch between color and B/W night time mode based on the amount of light. the make a physical and audible click when they perform this transition, and some people may find it annoying. it does not bother me.update 3-1-2012:I have been using this for a little over a week or so. everything is great. i love the remote access. you can watch live video of all four cameras. you can watch any of the recorded videos in the browser, or you can download the file to your PC through the browser. you can configure every setting through the web interface. i have zero need to ever connect the DVR to the TV.for the money it is understandable that the cameras are not super high resolution or anything. i am thinking about updating one or two of the cameras with a 700 TVL camera.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sight Beyong Sight!", "Author": "Miguel", "ReviewID": "RUORJTXHTAK7I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content":

I'm still entertaining the idea but loving this already, for people who work at home like myself its just so necessary. The options are fantastic too if i wanted to save space I can switch on the motion detectors or just let it roll all day and check it from my smartphone, software included of course which is great because for the price I don't want to be nickel and dimed.

Mckneely", "ReviewID": "RLJXVR85JLDS4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the 825508-S 8-Channel, 8-Camera system, and decided I wanted to install it myself. My wife and I had moved into a much larger house. I am an independent contractor and I work mostly from an office at one far end of the \"compound\". It is probably 200 ft. and down a flight of stairs to walk to the other end of the house to see who is at the front door. The house did come with an intercom installed but only friendies were likely to use the device. With such a large house (5,000+ sq ft) it was making me feel like I was unable to know what was going on inside and around the house even during the daytime while I worked. This system changed that. It is so amazing that with one quick glance, I can instantly see what is going on around my property.By far, the greatest amount of work involved to install this system is running the cables and mounting the cameras. Besides the 8 camera inputs, the system can also monitor four microphones, although I have not yet used this feature. There is one VGA output that you can run to a monitor as well as two composite outputs for standard definition viewing elsewhere inside the building. There are also two speaker outputs.It took me six months before I had installed all eight cameras. The reason it took me so long is that I wanted to put a great deal of thought into where I wanted to place the cameras, where and how I could run the cables and how I could mount the cameras. Also, I do not like the idea of punching holes in the exterior of my house.Soon after I bought this system, a store only three or four blocks away was robbed by three gunmen. My wife and I discovered this when we walked down to a local fast food restaurant and found a TV station van with 50ft antennae doing a live interview on the parking lot. The surveillance cameras that were mounted in the parking lot are unprotected from the weather. When I watched the news story that night on television, the images were pretty poor because of condensate from water that had penetrated the housing. They were mounted right in the open. I decided that I didn't want my cameras exposed to the elements in this way. So those cameras that I could not mount under an overhang, I built a little bird-house shelter for each of them. This turned out to be a good thing and my images look more clear than the ones on the news broadcast. All of my cameras are hanging from a horizontal surface that is above them. I think the adjustments work best if you mount your cameras this way. Each camera has a threaded base that allows you to yaw the camera and a stamped locking nut to fix it in position. There is another screw that allows you to adjust the pitch to control the angle above/below horizontal. Finally, there is a screw that you can loosen to roll (bank) the camera to make sure it is horizontal.When you are thinking about where you want to mount your cameras, keep in mind the sun's arc across the sky during the day and avoid having your camera looking directly into the sun. Even if the sun is out of the field of view, the images you get from your cameras will become nearly useless if the sun is close to being in view. But your camera shouldn't get damaged as long as it is not staring directly into the sun.Before you install your cables, you should find a closet that is located centrally in your home. This is to make sure you can keep the cables as short as you can to reach the main console. The system comes with eight 60 ft. cables. But my longest run was 150 ft. I bought my longer cables here on Amazon and they work pretty well:VideoSecu AV Video Audio Power 100ft Feet BNC Cable Security Camera Wire for CCTV Home Surveillance with 2 RCA Male to BNC Female Connectors 3JGVideoSecu 150 Feet Video Power Security Camera Cable for CCTV Surveillance DVR System Installation CBV150 C13You can connect additional composite monitors using a cable like this:1-RCA Composite Video / Subwoofer / Digital Coax / S/ PDIF Patch Cable 100ftBut you will need an adaptor to mate it with the BNC that is on the back of the main console like this one:RiteAV - BNC Male to RCA Female AdapterDon't expect the camera images to be as good as comparable videos on your computer monitor. It didn't take long before I got tired of crawling up on ladder in a closet to reach the system console for configuring the system and monitoring the cameras. It turned out that I needed 100 ft. of cabling to connect the VGA monitor and mouse interfaces to a desk where I wanted to access the system. It was pretty easy to find a 100 ft. VGA cable and the images look pretty good through such a long run. But the USB interface will not go that far. I found a product that uses a 100 ft. Cat5e cable for this purpose. Read about it here: USB Extender Adapter (use w/ Cat5e Cable) up to 150 ft: by Abacus24-7The one thing I need to warn people about is that little spiders will spin webs around the camera's lens. These are not visible during the day but they really degrade the view at night. Since the lenses in these cameras are so small, these filaments spun by our micro arachnid tenants can be almost microscopic to our bare eyes. But at night, they reflect a great deal of the infrared emitted by the built-in LEDs. You will need to periodically climb up a ladder and brush them away. A small paint brush made for painting pictures will do the job nicely. You won't necessarily even see the web filaments when you perform this service so I recommend moving your brush around in a circle from the inside out in a pattern that will clear a cone of space projected out from the front of the lens. Besides spiders, I have observed wasps and even hummingbirds coming to visit my cameras.We have something like 17 pecan trees on our property. Probably half of these are located on a long sidewalk along the street front. During 2011, we had a drought so we didn't get any pecans. But during 2012 we had a bumper crop. Watching these cameras, I have spied probably at least 20 incidents of people stealing our pecans. Perhaps it is because people don't realize that our place is a private residence. The house was built using commercial construction and I have been told that people think it is a church, a medical clinic or even an art gallery. But sometimes even families will come with their bags to fill up on \"free\" (i.e. stolen) pecans. Many of them will even park their trucks or cars (nicer and more expensive than mine) in our driveway while they load up. By now, many of them know not to do that because I can now see them from my office and I can be out there in less than a minute to stop the pilfering. But it is a good thing that this is the most serious crime I have seen so far using my new surveillance system.The one criticism I have for this system (and the reason I gave it only four stars) involves getting the web interface to work so that you access it from you computer. I am a Windows 7 user and the installation procedure requires me to disable the security on my computer. This is all because Swann didn't bother to supply their software with a valid security certificate. A large company like Swann should have been able to do that. Instead, I am just not using their web interface.****** UPDATE April 23, 2013 ******On the afternoon of April 17 I notice that one of my feeds showed \"VIDEO LOSS\". I reviewed the archive and found the instant when it went out. I had no extra hardware so I ordered another unit for spares. It turns out that the camera is still good but the cable seems to be bad. This was not totally unexpected because that one cable has an outside run of about 50 ft. It is more exposed to the elements and it has some tension on it besides having a total length of 150 ft. Unfortunately, this will be the most difficult run to redo as I will need to pull it inside. One thing to note is that the forward part of the cylindrical housing must be made of plastic while the rest is metal. After a fews months outdoors it fades from black to a metalic copper on its way to silver. This is very strange.

It worked fine so I finally did the permanent installation yesterday. For a four-camera DVR system under 300 bucks, this is a pretty good deal, but it's not without its limitations.The Good:  * Other than actually running the cables, it's really easy to set up  * Daylight picture quality is good for a color security system  * DVR stores up to 120 days worth of video - but at higher quality settings (really 'a must') it's down to 14, but this is still impressive.  * Hard drive is really quiet. Unlike my DirecTV DVR, you could install this on your nightstand and it wouldn't keep you awake  * Night vision moderately useful  * Displays all four cameras on-screen at once, or individually  * Motion detection option works well  * Price is rightThe Bad:  * Night vision is very limited in range. 10-15 feet. Beyond that, night shots are dark and grainy. You should supplement this system with security lights or motion lights.  * The WORST thing about this system (and may be true of others) is that the cameras have a narrow focal range (37 degrees). I have a small, shallow front yard, and it takes 3 cameras to get decent (still not full) coverage. For example, I have one camera mounted to the eaves and pointing almost perpendicular to the driveway. From 25' away, the camera covers exactly the length of the car. I know that the wider the angle, the less resolution you have on your subject, but I really wish these had adjustable zoom lenses. They should be twice as wide. These are better suited for monitoring hallways, cash registers, entry ways, etc. To cover a yard, they have to be placed farther back than my little suburban lot permits.The Ugly:  * Nothing too ugly. The user interface is pretty clunky. It has nice, full-color, high-resolution icons and such, but navigating is very awkward. It uses a remote or a mouse (both included)At first I could not get the UI to come up at all. Apparently the graphics can only be output to the baseband outputs -or- the VGA output, but not both simultaneously. The default is baseband and I was using VGA. Hold down the REW button for several seconds and it will switch the UI to the VGA.Also - there is only so much bandwidth it can record. I made the mistake of setting the cameras to their highest setting and ended up with REALLY POOR video quality. They have an interesting UI for balancing the quality and framerate between the cameras. I found the best setting to be the high-quality D1 setting, but at 15 frames per second rather than 30.I installed the playback software on my Macbook Pro - it appears to work, but I haven't transferred any video files over to test it. I have tried to get the web monitoring to work but haven't been able to. I pointed my browser to the DVR's IP address. Using Safari, Opera, and Firefox, 1 showed me the Swann logo and nothing more, and 2 told me I needed a plug-in, which I said \"go ahead and install\" but it made no difference.

I get emails whenever there is activity on my property, and that's a nice sense of security.

From the camera and cable install to navigating the software on the DVR, it was all very user friendly.Cons: Viewing the wireless feed remotely from a smart phone is not as reliable.  When I change the port settings, some times it works, most of the time it doesn't, which is too bad.  There is an email address for tech support on the App, so I emailed them and received a response within a couple of days from someone in China.  Their advice didn't really help a whole lot though.  Also, while you can change the sensitivity setting of each camera, you cannot change how sensitive it is during the day vs. at night.  At night, it is super sensitive, but if you don't have enough light, it might be difficult to determine what set the camera off if it's something small.  Rain sets them off constantly.  And the infrared attracts insects, which attract spiders who spin their webs in front of the camera and I have to go out there and sweep them off on a regular basis or else they will keep them recording constantly as well.  Of course that's not a manufacturer issue, it's just nature.So it's a great system, worth every penny, I just wish that the remote viewing worked more consistently, and that you could change the night sensitivity so that it didn't pick up weather.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Swann SWDVK-82550", "Author": "tam403", "ReviewID": "R12AQ2UQ6UY0FK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very happy with this camera system.

The quality!Ugh, it's so poor. sure you can tell who your mother, father, and brothers are when they walk into the shot but when it's a stranger good luck.If you're buying this to monitor employees such as nannies, pool guy, or whoever it's fine.But if a stranger walks into the shot good luck ever figuring out who it is. It's my biggest regret because I bought this for home security. If a group of men robbed my house and I handed the footage to the police it would be utterlessly pointless. They would need to hire a scientific forensic team to make out peoples faces or details. Realistically they would only do that for a murder.If you want this for home security don't be cheap with it. We're living in  the 21st century! lets act like it. Pay twice as much for the 1080p or 720p cameras. I completely tossed my money down the drain with this set up. Although I do love the interface and everything the quality just does not cut it and like I said it's a personal problem but a serious one if you want this to see who's breaking into cars or who's ruining your daisies or breaking your mail box.The point of the security camera is for you to see who's doing the naughty things. Pay double for the 720p or 1080p you won't regret it.  You NEED GOOD QUALITY IMAGES.I Hope I save someone money with my post. I was fooled by all the happy and great reviews.

I assumed paying more meant I would get higher quality cameras and more importantly higher quality software. Having previously owned an SVAT 4 camera setup which was less than half as much it left much to desire in a security setup. I will start with the pros of this system.Pros- It supports audio monitoring- They have an android app (albeit buggy)- The video quality is decent enough to make out a face if the cameras are positioned properlyCons- The finish on the cameras is awful.

I attempted to use multiple routers with every possible setting (UPNP/Firewall/DMZ/flashing different firmware/static routing/e.t.c.)I eventually gave in and connected a switch behind the cable modem + paid a monthly premium for a second IP address for the DVR and moblie viewing still was not functioning. When I called their technical support (outsourced to india) I spoke to a representative about the situation who kept stating \"sir you have to forward the correct ports in your router\" I had to argue with her that that was irrelevant because the DVR was not behind a router and the interface was connected directly to the ISPs WAN. After 15 minutes of arguing I requested to speak with a higher tier of support. I was transferred to a supervisor who was polite and said he would email me instructions to update the firmware on the DVR to see if that solved the issue. I never received the email even though I verbally confirmed my email address (Yes I checked my spam filter). I had to call back again and request the link to download new firmware. This time I received the email so I had to run out to the store to buy a usb flash drive. The firmware update went smoothly (yay! one thing went right) and after trying a few different ports I was able to get mobile view working on both the web browser and android.- One of the cameras died after 6 months- The web viewer does not work with windows 8 no matter what browser/security settings you tryWith its current amazon price (just over 500) I can say you get what you pay for.

I'm not given to exaggeration, but in fact it's no exaggeration to say that this company seems to be firing on all cylinders.  The product was well made, reasonably priced and promptly shipped.  Many electronics companies seem to do that while skimping on the writers and proofreaders of the manual and/or customer service.  Not this one.  The manual is notable for its clarity and accuracy, and when I called customer service because I couldn't get a mouse-controlled pointer on the screen, I got a real person after pressing only a single button for Customer Service.  He came on the line promptly and seemed to be well trained; right away, he knew what I needed to do and told me.Since I've been dealing with installing the cameras (and let me tell you, it's not easy running the wires in a 113-year-old stone mansion) I haven't gone through all the programming of the DVR, except the date and time, but so far it seems to be very straightforward.  A bonus I hadn't known about beforehand (which would only have made my purchase all the more likely) is the ability to program the motion sensors to detect motion only on part of the screen.  We live on an intersection, so the ability to tell the system not to bother me if the motion is only a passing car is huge.Philadelphia now has a program by which you can register your security cameras with the police, so they might be able to catch other criminals more easily, too.  I'm hoping this system I bought will really help clean up our neighborhood and improve property values.  For certain I'll be recommending this Swann system to my friends and neighbors.  One suggestion to Swann for this kind of thing-- something that automatically recognizes and records license plates might be helpful.

It doesn't get much easier than this friends, other reviews stated the system was not compatible with Mac's and Safari; au contraire Watson, I phoned Swann customer service, 3 minutes later a tech took control of my MacBook Air, downloaded the firmware to a flash drive which I used to update the DVR and that phase was complete. I have a large home and had anticipated the need for extension video cables which was necessary. The (4) 150ft extenders available on Amazon were great but you need to purchase BNC female to female coupler adapters to work with the Swann cables. Radio Shack has them. My installation guys completed the cabling by Thursday afternoon and I was fully operational when they left. I have 4 cameras installed and they work flawlessly. The infrared is just terrific at night. The DVR is so easy to operate, search for footage by movement tags is simple and efficient. This system is way better than I expected for the money. Friday morning I phoned Swann Support to setup remote access-IT DOESN'T GET ANY EASIER THAN THIS. The tech took control of my computer, accessed my router, downloaded firmware updates to the Netgear router, configured it, walked me though the DVR configuration and in 5-7 minutes I had remote access on my laptop and the IP address for my iPhone once I download the App for phone viewing.  I don't understand the negative reviews on Swann Support; my experience with them rates a 10 in every way. I'm off to Hawaii tomorrow and can monitor my home inside and out from 3000 miles away.  I purchase a lot of things online and this Swann System is everything I could have hoped for. The cameras are not HD, but the images are crisp, in color and amazingly clear in infrared. I'm guessing do-it-yourselfers can do the cabling themselves if they have the time, the system setup is very simple. The hard part is deciding where to place the cameras and how you're going to string video and power cable to those locations. I highly recommend this system to anyone whether they need security surveillance, monitoring of elderly parents or young children or keeping track of your dogs and cats.Update: The remote monitoring works perfectly.

It comes with everything you need, except maybe a longer cable for a camera or two depending on your configuration.  We had someone do the camera wiring to avoid crawling around in an attic, and even at that it was a pretty small investment.Will it help identify a burgler or vandal?  Yes.The bad news, however is pretty bad.Camera resolution is not great, even with the upgraded cameras.  The system comes advertised as being able to record in D1 format, but every indication is that even with the system set to record at D1 all you get really is CIF - 320x240.  You aren't going to be able to see a tattoo on an arm like that, so if that is what you are hoping for to id your bad guy ... well, this isn't the system for that job.  Maybe one with real D1 resolution would help.Notifications via email work and are easy to set up... except for the fact that you get the email as long as an hour after the event.  It sends you a single still frame and all the nifty apps for Android and iPhone/iPad WILL NOT PLAY BACK RECORDED VIDEO.  This means that you need to connect a real computer to your network (if that is even possible remotely) to view what really happened.  This lack of being able to access recorded video via remote applications is a serious flaw.The notifications coming so late after the fact is also a serious problem with the system.  While it is nice to get a picture emailed to you, having it come long after the fact - as much as an hour, but usually about 40 minutes - makes it almost pointless.Swann has technical support.  Unfortunately, they cater their support to folks that take the parts out of the box, never read the instructions, and then call for help when they can't figure it out.  So their support people are good at leading you through the menus and telling folks they actually do need to connect both wires for the camera to work.  Anything like a real technical question - like how you can get the notifications in a timely manner - and they are completely stumped.  I do have to give Swann credit for the support they are offering - considering the wait times for phone support there must be a lot of people calling that can't read the instructions.  The manuals are quite good considering what is common with consumer electronics today.  No Engrish here.Setting up the motion detection for notifications and recording can be somewhat of a pain also.  It takes patience and an understanding of what is going on with the cameras.  Also, any outdoor camera is going to be subject to insects, birds and bats flying by and triggering recording.  Also you need to be aware of things like a nearby roadway where headlights shine on the building, air conditioner fans rotating and such like that.  Also, outdoor cameras require regular cleaning of things like spiderwebs.The cleaning aspect of the cameras was somewhat of a surprise to me.  I had a neighbor that had cameras put on their 2nd story eaves - how are you going to clean those cameras off?Final hint on camera placement is something I picked up.  High camera placement is the norm and people expect that.  So they wear hats and don't look up.

The fact that a dedicated DVR unit is handling the video through a corded feed means that the wireless bandwidth and processing power limitations are no longer a factor. I have it set up for viewing via PC, Android, and on my main television set.

PC access on the local network works and the remote admin console works like a charm. Had my son access from another city and the console worked there as well. This has been an education. There are a few things that the manual never mentions....like having to set up your router to always assign the same IP address to the DVR via association with the MAC address. I actually intend to use this system without a PC attached so have had to re-flash a Linksys WRT54 router with DD-WRT firmware to get some really neat functionality, like having the router maintain the DDNS update between the Dynamic IP your ISP provides and my chosen  DDNS provider's host URL I set up on their system (embedded Inadyn software in DD-WRT).

In addition, allows you to choose which recordings you want to review at a specific time and date.2)  Decent image quality when there is sufficient lighting.3)  The cameras that come with this unit are upgraded for better night vision4)  The night vision is better than expected.  If there's a street light in the shot or on the edge of the shot, the image gets a little washed out.5)  Great phone app.  VERY nice feature!  It helped with setting up the cameras which is a plus.  And I found it handy to just quickly check on the cameras before going to bed to make sure that they're still fine.CONS:1)  You cannot zoom in with the cameras.  It is just a basic camera.  You can (in a way) zoom in when viewing on the screen, but it is simply cropping the image and enlarging the existing image.  So it makes it difficult to make out any details if the person/object is > 10-15ft away.2)  Now that the region of interest has to be closer to the camera, you have to be careful that nothing is actually too close to it at night.  I tried hanging these cameras between the railings of my balcony with the front sticking out ~1.5 inches.  When I went to check on the recordings after it got dark, I noticed that nothing was in focus.  There has to be at the very least 2-3 inches of clearance on the sides and several inches in front or else the camera will have trouble focusing.  And this issue of focusing also includes window screens.  I tried propping one camera against a window and it was focusing fine during the day.  Once it got dark outside, the camera tried to focus on the screen and all I saw were whitish gray blobs.3)  These need to be screwed down.  The base of the cameras aren't heavy enough to balance out the cameras.4)  This might just be me, but I had issues watching the recordings.  I found it difficult to figure out the UI.  But once you figure out how to choose the date and time, it's easy to fast forward/rewind at different speeds.Overall, it's a decent product.  It's good when there is sufficient light or nothing nearby to interfere with it's ability to focus.

The camera resolution is adequate and I'm impressed with the infrared capabilities provided by the built-in LED's.  I think the system was a bargain.

In principal, I should be able to review all 8 channels at once to check for anything noteworthy.  I've found, however, that when multiple channels are displayed on playback, many individual recorded events are skipped (i.e. not displayed when other channels are displaying recordings for the same time period).

I didn't think it needed much planning and my father and I spent about 5 hours running cables and setting it up.

Here are my impressions:Installation: If you can set up a computer, you can do this. Basically it is connecting the cameras with long cables to the DVR and power supplies. The DVR is then connected to your monitor or tv. VGA connection recommended for highest viewing video (not recording). Mounting the cameras and running the cables is no easy task and you want to get it right so plan ahead. It is a two day project for my house. I have not connected to the internet yet so no comment on that. I found the menus for setting up the DVR itself very easy and I had no problems navigating just using the supplied remote. The more you play with it the more comfortable you become. Even the owner's manual is informative and user friendly.Video quality:  There is a big difference between what you see live and what you see on a recording which is played back. The day live view is great although the wide-angle lens limits detail and is not great for all purposes. The night view is grainy but adequate. The recorded video when played back is much less impressive and lacks clarity. At night it is pixelated and hard to see any details. I am still playing with frame rates and resolution.Features: I think it is pretty user-friendly with adequate features. I am still trying to see how effective the motion sensing is so I can't comment yet. The DVR is compact and is noiseless, but the bright red flashing hard drive light is annoying at night, but I can tape that over. It is pretty easy to set desired parameters for each individual camera. You can search for an individual recorded event by date and time easily, but it has a what I consider a slow \"fast forward\" capability. The quality of the components are what you would expect for the price.Conclusion: Good value. Adequate for a basic security system with many features, but not high end and mediocre recorded video IMHO. The important issue is that just the sight of video cameras on a property is a deterrent to evil-doerFollow-up: After spending some time with this system I have to say I am pretty pleased with it. I think the folks at Swann gave this a lot of thought and came up with a good consumer product at a fair price. The motion detection feature is excellent and I was able to get better resolution on the recordings. It may not be an HD recording, but it is satisfactory for the price.

At David's advice, I ordered the system and at the same time ordered 100 foot runs which we used.  My electrician put additional motion lights up and mounted two cameras.  The picture quality is very good; I still need to test the night vision recording for quality.  The menu driven setup is fairly intuitive.

We'll install another camera, and figure out how to connect wirelessly once we have the system running the way we want.

The picture quality is very good for inexpensive cameras, and the DVR functions perfectly all the way down to motion sensing and outside communication.

Everything needed for installation was in the box, and the instructions were easy to follow.  I would recommend planning out where each camera will go and how to run the wires before you begin drilling holes in your house.Installing the 8 cameras took me about 4 hours total.I would also recommend having a dedicated monitor or HD TV connected to the DVR at all times - it makes making some changes much easier.My only minor complaint was with the manual - it really jumps around from one issue to another.  It would be helpful to have a more logical flow to the instructions on setting up the DVR.  I also had to call because I couldn't get the motion detection to record properly - they did answer the phone and the support tech was great.  He explained I needed to set up a schedule for recording (not mentioned in the manual).The Network installation was easy (but this is what I do) so I may be biased.The Adroid APP works great!  It is fun to see what the kids are up to when we are away.  It is also nice to know where our boys are playing outside without worrying.The Night vision is really good for a home system.  We have decent ambient light from street lights and security lights around the house.  However, one camera is in the dark and it still can detect and see someone from 40-50 ft away.  It may not be admissible in court but the video is good enough on that camera in the dark.I would recommend spending the money for the 8 camera system - even if you don't need all 8 installed you will have a spare or two.For some reason the internet based viewer is sort of grainy to view but it is acceptable.Finally, plan ahead, know your local laws on where cameras can be placed, and you should have no issues.", "Date": "November 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "works well", "Author": "DLK \"Okiezeke\"", "ReviewID": "R2XDCO6AT5Q3T9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this system for over 6 mos. and have had no problems.

Cables are not too thin and not too thick but do note that the point where the cables split to power and video are very delicate and tear easily, I suggest putting electrical tape over these weak areas before running any wires. This however will happen with any camera cable, its not a quality issue with these cables. All cameras came working, and all infared bulbs work unlike some other brands. We only are having an issue with one of the cameras and thats only at night (for some reason the night vision on this camera is way too bright regardless of what you set brightness to) but this is a minor issue (UPDATE: 6/4/2012 We found out that it was because it was pointing at our pool and reflecting the IR light back into the camera lense...fixed by adjusting camera angle or moving camera farther away from the pool). Camera mounts and cameras are very durable, made of heavy black steel with adjustable sun shields. All cameras colors were right on for the most part, not bad enough to complain at all. Also, the night vision works great up to 30 or 35 feet I'd say, but having motion sensing lights on your house solves this problem anyways...a very little amount of light will make these cameras see very well (even street lights if close enough to your house). What I really love about these cameras is that the mounts can be turned and adjusted in ANY POSITION, no matter where you put the mount, you will always be able to move the camera so so picture is right side up and tilted the correct way! Many other camra mounts fail to achieve this, and are only mountable at certain angle...not these cameras, mount anywhere you want! The DVR hasnt had any problems, works great. Its quiet, runs pretty cool, and setting up remote access was easy with Swann's great customer service via live chat (with the ability to take control of your computer remotely to setup your DVR for you...live chat support avaiable on their website [...]). Was connected to support within 2 minutes (already contacted them 3 times, they have great service...people who said their support sucks probably tried calling them...its the 21st century people, using their chat support is much quicker). *NOTE: You MUST UPDATE the DVR FIRMWARE BEFORE REMOTE ACCESS WILL WORK, the DVR is not updated when you recieve it!!! (Swanns live chat support had the firmware updated for me within 10 minutes) The DVR menus are slick and smooth, and wireless mouses do work on this unit which is nice...the features of this DVR are way above what your paying, well worth it! This product is well worth the money and its upgradeable HDD and ability to add 4 more cameras is perfect. (Havent had problems with DVR resetting randomly like other reviewers said, however there is a setting in the DVR to have it auto reset on a schedule). The DVR (500 GB) will record for 2 weeks with 4 cameras on best quality or 1 week with 8 cameras...when they say above that you get 60 days or whatever, that's on lowest qulity recording, a little misleading but I warned you. It's no problem though as the hard drive is easily taken out and able to be replaced with a higher capacity HDD.

My place is fairly isolated and a good 15 min from any police patrols. A standard security system like ADT offers would do me no good since the intruders would have plenty of time to take off with my stuff and flee into the woods. This system provides a good deterrent to potential thieves. The cameras, while small, are still quite visible from a distance.Setup took me approximately 4.5 hours from opening the box to doing the final checks on the feeds. The supplied 60 foot cords were more than long enough for my mid size two level home. The hardest part of the install was crawling around the attic running the cables. Once connected, the cameras all worked flawlessly.The picture quality during the day is quite good and night views are clear. The box states up to 50' range at night but I would say its more like 30', which is perfectly acceptable for my application. When installing the cameras, be sure to avoid having too much of the wall visible as this will create a bright infrared reflection and greatly diminish the range and brightness of the rest of the view.The manufacturer provides their own mobile viewing applications, however like other reviewers, I had trouble getting this to work. I downloaded IP Cam Viewer and had it setup in under 2 minutes.My one complaint is the lack of Mac support for viewing the feeds on a computer. The manufacturer has provided a plugin that is supposed to allow you to view it with Safari, but I was never able to get anything other than a network error message. I was able to use the provided NetView application as well as Internet Explorer to view the feeds running Windows 7 in Parallels.

The whole system is pretty good.  Initially I was having some difficulty with poor camera performance at night.

I relocated it slightly to move it further from the white surface it was close to and the picture at night was much improved.I finally got a second camera wired up and added and noticed its picture was significantly better than the first camera.  I tweaked the camera settings on the first camera and bingo!  Picture on both was outstanding.Setting up access to the recorder on my network was the easiest I've ever seen.  I've had a lot of wifi cams and helped co-workers with similar DVRs to the Swann unit, but this one was by far the smoothest to set up.  Mobile access is good on my Android phone and I'm very pleased.The ability to set specific areas of the field of view of each camera to detect motion is fantastic.  The \"alarms\" are good, and it definitely emails out screen captures when it detects motion.  I had to set it up to use Gmail (which Swann recommends) as the SMTP server...I was never able to get it to work with my Comcast account.One other useful thing I discovered is that the camera mounts are a perfect match to the threaded portion on most floodlight fixtures.

For the internet setup I had to manually forward the ports on my linksys wireless router wrt54gs.  The router says it has upnp which I enabled - but it just didnt work.  The phone apps work although over wifi at my house its slow.  If you have only one or two camera views up it helps alot and is delayed but works pretty good.  I leave the system on motion all the time.  Its really sensitive - but thats a good thing.  You can mask off visible area and dial down sensitivity which does help.  But inevitably a bug will fly right into the lens at night or a spider will weave webs all over the camera and set it off.  The quality id say looks about 4x better than video quality you see in stores - its pretty good.  Id say you can make out a face mostly at about 6ish feet.  The color for me was very good.  I saw others complaining about having to adjust it.  Mine was perfect and needed no adjustment at all.  The email snap shots are pretty low quality and no way to make better.  Also they may or may not catch person triggering motion.  Nevertheless, still nice to know when the cameras are tripping.  The remote management interface is absolutely awesome.  Its better than managing from the dvr itself. You need good web bandwidth to make it workable - but over wifi at home its very very good.  I can live view and also - check cameras for recordings its super sweet.  I can see when my girlfriend gets home and leaves and when the dog goes outside to go bathroom.

I showed all my friends and they were very impressed.  Overall I really like the fact I can see what is going on around my house.  In the end I think it just makes you feel safer because you realize probably 99.99% of the time your house is boring. Nothing going on.  Also knowing whose in front of your house at night.  You realize its just walkers and people passing through haha nothing to worry about.  Overall - I give very high marks for this system its amazing for the money.  Beware though I inquired into install costs and got quotes of around $2k for camera systems for 4HD installed, or from electrician to wire and estimating 2k plus!!!  It took a long time to do it myself ghetto style - but the cost - ZERO - haha.  I highly recommend buying 150 foot cabling separately.  The included 60 foot cabling is not very long once you realize you have to go up walls and around things to wire up.  I just took excess cabling and wound it up near the camera and tied it up.  Didn't notice much if any quality difference in 60 foot vs 150 feet cabling to the cameras - didn't seem to make much difference.  Good luck with your system.Other details:At times the system gets stuck recording motion when there is none a reboot fixes it. (not often)Also, sometimes the system gets stuck sending email snapshots from a camera where nothing is happening - again a reboot fixes. (not often)On the networking setup:I followed example in manual for gmail - worked perfectly.For internet - as above I mentioned I had to forward ports manually through router - on linksys WRT54GS you just access 192.168.1.1 from your web to get access to the router - also - when fwding ports manually from router - you have to specify IP of DVR - so I configured dvr to be static IP even though my local network is DHCP - I figured worst case I would get a conflict and notice and reset the router - no big deal.  So far no issues whatsoever - set DVR to 192.168.1.7.  I have cox cable internet - they basically give me a static public IP (on a normal account - they might change later but i wont care - ill just redo setup) - if you look up [...] it tells you your public IP.  So after ports are forwarded - you should be able to remotely access the dvr by opening 192.168.1.X:85 (in IE - after following IE setup for security settings mentioned in the manual) where X is what you gave the dvr.  This will open the dvr on your local network.  This should work even if you didn't get your ports forwarded properly I believe.  Next step is to test if you can access the dvr through your public IP - to do this - just supplant 192.168.1.X with your public IP.  If all is well - you will have the web interface come up.  For me this was very slow compared to local network access (via wifi but still a ton faster than public IP).  Also, follow the manually instructions on how to change the security settings so Internet Explorer can run the ActiveX scripts.  If this works - then the phone app SwannView will most likely work for certain - except they use a different port for phone - as long as you forwarded the ports mentioned in the manual you should be fine.  Its helpful to know that if you can access it locally on your net first - it will help to debug the public IP part (this is not explained in the manual).  If your public IP changes then you will have to do deal with the DNS thing - which I didn't bother with - so I can't help there - but it's just another layer over what you will have already setup.  Hope this helps.

It comes with 8 cameras, a 500GB DVR, remote control unit, mouse, and all electrical connectors/wires/plugs required to connect everything. The cameras are perfect size (not too big and not too small) and they provide excellent picture quality during the day and good picture quality to within 15-20 feet with dim lighting at night.There are (4) four ways to manage, view, and/or monitor the DVR: (1) At the console itself. (2) Using the remote control unit (3) Using a computer on your LAN/WAN (with the Swann PC Software installed) (4) Using a Mobile Device such as a Blackberry Smartphone, PDA, etc... I tested all four methods and all worked quite well. The hardest part of the setting this secuirty system up was configuring the router to ensure connectivity using a mobile device over the 3G network or a PC on a WAN. The Swann instructions are not that good - in part because there are so many mobile devices on the market. However, I was able to figure everything out on my own without a call to Swann Customer Support.I documented exactly how to connect a Blackberry 9370 Smartphone to the DVR over the 3G Network but Amazon.com would not allow me to publish the website address of this instruction page as part of my review. Therefore, I can't even tell you the website address to go to.  However, the most important part is ensuring that UPnP is enabled on the DVR itself and that \"Port Forwarding\" is properly configured on your router to process TCP/UDP packets. Swann Customer Support can assist you if you do not have basic networking knowledge (Private IP Address vs Public IP Address, Port IDs, port forwarding, packet types, etc...).The bottom line is that this system does EVERYTHING that it says it does. The Swann instructions are not that good but you should be able to connect everything if you have basic knoweledge of how to connect and operate a standard DVD recorder.

Solution in my case was to set the Airport Extreme to run in \"bridge mode\". (Yes, there are downsides)Next, I had to access the DSL router thru my LAN to find the internal IP. I set the DSL router to pass Upnp.Of course, had to go to [...] to find out the public IP.I can reach the DVR from home or away on PC / Iphone.

I got these because the whole set of four, with DVR, is half the price I paid for each of the Panasonic cams... they also have night vision, but lack pan, tilt and zoom. The Swann cams are very easy to install, set up, and use.  I did not even read the manual at all... it simply worked. I was easily able to view the cams within Internet Explorer and via the client software provided by Swann.  I do not suggest that people even bother installing any software on a PC, just use IE.  I have the system hard wired to my home LAN and that worked just by plugging it in.  I have not yet been able to view the cams from over the internet outside my home, but I plan on getting that up and running next.  I did try to download the viewer on my Blackberry, but Swann does not seem to support my model of BB yet.  There is no sound.  The video is average, but not sharp.  Night vision works a bit, but only in a very limited area.  So far it has only been running one day, so I don't have a lot to say yet.  But I do wish I got the model with 8 cams instead of only 4.  Not to have four more of these model cameras, rather, to add some better/more cams on to the 8 cam DVR.  Definitely worth the price.UPDATE:I am easily able to view the cams on my iPad and also outside my home.  I still believe this is worth the price.  I recently upgraded to a 16 camera professional model DVR though... not because there is anything wrong with this model, rather, because I needed more than 4 cams.  In fact, if anyone wants my old one, minus the hard drive and cameras, I'd be happy to give it to them for FREE.

We figured it was neighborhood kids due to the things that were not stolen -- i.e., one guy left his wallet (containing cash and credit cards) on his front seat but they only took the change in his ashtray.The included instructions were minimal but clear and had plenty of color pictures to guide you thru setting up the cameras (which you really could figure out without the manual.)The first thing I did with this was swap out the 500 GB hardrive that it include with a 2 TB Western Digital Green drive I bought at the local Best Buy.  That was just as easy as opening a desktop computer and swapping out a drive plus, it greatly extends the amount of video you retain before old video gets overwritten.I added 4 more cameras and have the system recording 24/7, except for a weekly automated reboot).  It took about 9 weeks before my initial video was overwritten.It has an on screen menu that allows you to setup up each camera, motion detection, alerts, etc. according to your preferences.  I figured that out without instructions but it would have been nice to have a comprehensive, full color manual that explained things in a little more depth.I did not try connecting this to the Internet and configuring it for smart phone viewing so, I can not speak to the ease or efficiency of that process.  Besides, why would you want the NSA looking at video of your house? :)The most time consuming part of the install, was running the wires from the cameras to the dvr.  I looked up \"how to fish wire\" and \"how to install security cameras\" videos on YouTube and that armed me with enough information to tackle those tasks.This is the first dvr system I have owned/worked with so, I cannot compare it to other systems.

The cameras are kinda cheap and clunky and have the \"convienence store\" quality video, but its a lot cheaper than a IP camera. It would be nice if the cameras were white to match the soffits on 90% of the houses out there but I suppose you can always paint them. The setup within the DVR is clunky as well but it works. I would like to have seen a mobile app that would let you change some of the settings remotely but not yet. The key to remote viewing is to have a uPNP router, so much easier than port forwarding. Swann also offers a free DDNS service which gives you a dedicated domain and IP address. So far the DDNS service has been pretty reliable. The length of the cables are about 60 ft and I bought some longer cables for cameras further away. You can configure each camera individually. I have some cameras with motion detection turned on when I'm away. You can set up active zones for the motion detection so if a car drives by or the dog walks by it wont trigger an alarm. The alarm email function sends a picture of the \"motion \" it detected. The instructions give examples for Gmail accounts but any email provider can be used. The only other thought I can make is that you need to leave yourself plenty of time for running cables. Give yourself at least an hour for each camera and take your time. The DVR should be hidden but accessible so that you can easily make changes to the alarm schedule.I've only had this running for about a week and will update if I get any new information.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "In this day and age, it is good to have the surveillance cameras", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3V1POG1T8HKPW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Product installation went okay, although pulling the wires through the attic crawlspace was hot, dirty work, that would be the same for any wired system.

Swann replaced it with minimal hassle.The video quality is adequate, not thrilling.  Happily for us, the most interesting things it records are the raccoons and skunks and possums and deer who visit in the middle of the night quite regularly, as opposed to porch pirates and burglars.  We did nail a local man who had the bad manners to bring his dog onto the front lawn to do its business.  I posted images from the recording to let him know that we knew, and that took care of the problem.We had some tricky time getting the sensitivity adjusted so the motion sensor does what it should do, instead of reacting to leaves blowing in the breeze.  Spiders sometimes make webs over the camera lights that confuse the sensor.We never did get the Internet connection so that we can see the DVR when away from home.  We think it is the firewall doing what it is supposed to do, which is to keep people out.After some discussion, we set the recognition area to omit monitoring of the street or the neighbor's curb, and monitor only our own yard and driveway.  Our neighbor asked us whether we had caught an image of a suspicious person that he noticed, but we did not.

I've used it for about 10 months now. While reviewing footage I get a blank screen on one or two of the cameras.  There seems to be no rhyme or reason.  The blank outs seem to last for about 30-60 seconds and it happens randomly on different cameras and different times. I also  get blank outs while reviewing on a ffwd or fast rewind but the picture sometimes comes back if I press normal speed.  It's maddening! The fast review only goes up to 16x normal speed which consumes much more time for reviewing (my other security dvr does 32x and offers snapshots which is more efficient).It took a while to figure out how to make programing changes- it is easy to exit without hitting the \"apply\" option (I lost some important recording because of this). The time on the clock seems to wander a minute or so a week but my other dvr does that too. Downloading to thumb drive can only happen in  predetermined segments of time.  I have mine set to 30 minutes but often my \"event\" crosses over 2 segments. Example: I have an event from 10:48 to 11:02 so I have to download one full hour worth (2- 30 min segments) to capture14 minutes on video.  The download time is surprisingly long. 2-3 minutes for each 30 minute batch.One thing I will do differently on my next purchase is upgrade to more memory.

I never had to call them!Update - 9/16/2013  Just found that the DVR was not recording.  Called customer service for Swann, very nice but some communications issues!  Sending unit back for replacement cost me $18 to send back, not happy about that.  Hope the next one lasts more than 2 months.  The problem I have with this unit, is it gave no indication it was not recording.  I have the unit hidden for security issues and without seeing the red HDD light not blinking, you don't know.  I was viewing via the Intranet and nothing alarmed me to the failure.  I just tried to pull up some old video and found it!  Right now I would down grade to 4 stars, if the next one doesn't last I will change it then!", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "easy to use", "Author": "Cynthia Valois", "ReviewID": "RNCWAEFS5KT2T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was the easiest security system I have ever put in!

Swan goes to great lengths a few places to encourage strong passwords, but since the login is via HTTP the credentials are sent in cleartext so they can easily be captured.

The DVR is compact and light weight. It has built in PTZ settings which is convenient. Connected to my Samsung HD TV via VGA cable, and the pictures are nice.  I am not a techie but found this extremely easy to set up.  Easy password setting, camera programming - motion detection etc. On screen displays, use a USB mouse or the remote control. You can customize each camera setting, when you want to record, level of sensitivity, and if you only want to record upon motion detection. I set up email alerts to my smartphone Google account. The email comes with a nice snapshot of whatever caused the motion detection (only selected 2 cameras so as not to get too many emails!). I like that you can select what areas of the camera view you want to allow motion triggered recording.  Nice playback pictures. Works well with Swann smart phone app (android).

Thepicture shows the inside of a car roughly 5-10 ft away. I've used these cameras around my house to catch various wildlife which has been digging up my garden and beyond 15ft you can barely make out the outline of the animal. Human faces are completely indistinguishable from beyond 15ft at night.The cameras at this level are good during the day. I can make out a human face from around 50-60ft. Beyond 65ft it gets a little difficult to see details. We are planning on purchasing several higher level cameras from Swann to cover longer distances. These cameras (the 550's) are only going to be used at the front and back door.The installation was easy enough; the camera have several screws you can loosen to adjust the yawn, pitch and roll of the camera. The rain shield is adjustable forward or backward. The cables are good enough to each several important areas on one side of the house, but I had to order several cable extensions to cover the other side.I find the menu system easy to use, but the searching for \"motion alarm\" can be quite tedious. Any moth which fly in front of the camera will set it off. My event log is usually loaded with 200 events each evening, making it a long time before you actually see what set it off.The HD is small, only 500 meg, I already put in a 2 tera drive to increase the storage.I've yet to set it up on the internet and use the software to view from my phone, but from other reviews I expect it to be suitable for what I need.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "easy set up", "Author": "Diane Rosa", "ReviewID": "R1U7OFSHB99IVK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "easy set up, had difficulty with internet viewing, pic quality good night vision not to good, wish the cameras came in white.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "camera stopped working", "Author": "jesse", "ReviewID": "R3BSATZQQMU4G4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the first day it rained a camera went out and it was a huge job to chance- not happy. need to find out about warranty", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheap, but leaves a lot to be desired", "Author": "arnold haan", "ReviewID": "R3ACOAD115QGZY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Interface is non-intuitive.

You literally just get stuck in settings sub screens.Web interface and RGB interface are very different, and don't need to be.  Major design flaw.The cables that come off the camera, the extension cables they send, as well as the 100 ft and 150 ft cables are CHEAP.  The extended cables don't have the color coding of the packaged cables.  The gauge of the wiring and cheap cheap cheap sheilding make it easy to pull apart and break the cables while wiring the house.  The extended cables will also take you about an hour a piece to unwind, and that's if you're careful.  They wouldn't even take the time to properly spool these 100 and 150 ft cables.  Again - CHEAP.The brackets that hold the cameras have very little flexibility.  Mostly caused by a lack of joints, and or/ joints that are too short to adjust.  The camera sheild actually hits the mounting bracket and limits ability to point the camera.Camera's also suck.  No zoom functionality is a joke.Swann's web site is USELESS for support.  you can read the manual you get in the box, but that's it.  Try looking for a forum or FAQ on their site.
