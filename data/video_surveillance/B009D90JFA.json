{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice Economical DVR but not secure for remote viewing", "Author": "G Man", "ReviewID": "R2KNXUOAHKQI9X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the price, you can't beat this DVR. It works very well and has many nice features. Just add a low cost SATA drive and you have yourself a nice economical video surveillance DVR.If you want to connect your DVR to internet for remote viewing, be very careful were you place your cameras! The DVR comes with three default user accounts that cannot be deleted. I would imagine that the factory has full access to these default accounts. Another flaw is the password length is very weak. Very easy for a hacker to crack, no matter what what combination password you use.Keeping those points in mind, just don't point your cameras at anything you don't want the general public to see and you could still use the remote viewing option safely; or just keep the DVR off the Web and use it for local viewing only.", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect, does what it's supposed to.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3VROYYGHTPK5P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was leary about the price, but my IP camera server died and I needed a low cost replacement. I ordered a 500gb sata drive from Amazon for $47 to go with this. I have four Swann Cameras connected to it.Bottom line is it works and was very easy to set up in terms of the hardware. As far as connecting to my android/setting up remote viewing, I had to resort to a youtube video...it has vonnic 1000 in the title and is easy to find. It walks you through setting up your router. This DVR uses a seperate \"Media\" port setting. The best apps I found for this DVR are IPcam (pro) and MEyePro. They work great.The Manual for this product is the typical Chinglish and largely useless, but fortunately it comes with a mouse and the interface is well designed and easy to navigate.Hardware setup: Easy. Installed hard drive with a few screws, attached cables (included with DVR), attached cameras, booted it up and it worked. Seems like it automatically did a quick (five seconds)drive format, and started recording. It really has alot of features and settings for such an inexpensive machine. I am not using PTZ (panTiltZoom)cameras so cannot speak to that feature.I was concerned about heat given the small size of the case and lack of fans, but after running with the case open for about 7 hours both the drive and the motherboard heatsink were just warm, not hot. Obviously you do not want to put this or any other component (stero, cable box, etc) on a tight space anyway. Since the case is all metal I'd say it probably dissipates heat nicely.On first turning it on it has an annoying alarm/beep system that goes off if you have a disconnected camera. I shut that feature off immediately.If you get it, here is the idiot's guide to getting started, free of Chinglish:1. remove cover and attach hard drive by screwing from the bottom. The four holes align with the bottom of the HDD.2. attach your cameras3. make sure the dvr is where you intend to keep it as the alarms go of when you wiggle the camera cables4. turn it on/plug it in, look at nice color bars for a minute, then right click on screen/camera images anywhere. This gives you the menu, which has a few layers but is easy to use.5. from here you can format the drive, though I think its automatic. Play around with the settings.6. make sure to set the video resolution to its highest (D1) as it defaults to a low res.7. find the \"vonnic 1000\" video on youtube and configure your router for remote viewing8. configure your tablet/phone app9. Enjoy watching your cats party it up while you work!! I have five.I will post a follow up in a few weeks.", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$99.99", "Features": "4 Channel\nStandalone DVR\nNot included HDD\nH.264/120FPS\nChina DVR", "Name": "Vonnic DVR-C1104SEFD Standalone DVR (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31W58LMXhXL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009D90JFA"}}
