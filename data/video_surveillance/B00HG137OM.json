image quality and night vision.Mounted it under an outdoor soffit, above the garage door, tucked in behind a downspout. Used a 1\" hole saw to pass the connectors through and powered it with a D-Link POE: D-Link DWL-P200 Power Over Ethernet AdapterAmazingly, the image maintains brightness, color and clarity when it's almost dark. Switches to b/w infrared beyond that.Works well with Foscam Blue Iris Professional for your PC and the Android or iOS version of IP Cam Viewer Full enabling you to watch feeds from your tablet while you adjust the cameras.If you get the Android app from Amazon, it's available to all of your Android devices without having to pay each time, so we have it on the Kindle Fire, the Samsung Galaxy Tab and our HTC smartphones. With the $4 IP Camera Viewer, you can watch your feeds from anywhere there's internet.This video was captured by Dahua's Pro Surveillance System, which usually comes with the included CD. If not, it's also a free download from the MarsCCTV site.So far, Blue Iris Pro seems to have an easier time sensing motion and recording feeds in a more useful format.Update: We now have 16 of these Dahuas powered by four TP-LINK TL-SF1008P at three homes and a shop, all monitored by Blue Iris Pro. Four of these are also recorded by a 16-channel Dahua NVR: Dahua 16 Channel Vertical NVR It's like a tiny computer with two removable hard drive bays on the front.

It seems the software is supposed to help you find your camera's IP address. But as I learned the cam has a statically assigned IP address on a specific subnet so I don't know what the software does, really.INTERFACE ISSUESI'm a US English speaker and ordered on the US Amazon site but the web interface was in Spanish, with what little is left of my high school Spanish class knowledge and a little help from Google Translate I was able to navigate the menus and change it to ingles (English). The change didn't take effect until I rebooted the camera (possibly at first I missed some of the Spanish goobly-gook telling me to reboot).UNUSUAL TCP/IP SETTINGSThank goodness for some other wonderful Amazon reviewers, I knew the default IP address is a static 192.168.1.108. Since my network is not on that subnet, I found the easiest way to log into the web interface was to temporarily assign my PC any random static IP on that subnet. For example, ip address 192.168.1.163, subnet 255.255.255.0. Once logged into the web interface (admin/admin), I changed the camera's network settings to get an IP from DHCP. It kind of did that, but got the DHCP settings just ONE time and used those settings to then create STATIC IP address and DNS settings. I suppose they did this to alleviate port forwarding problems associated with dynamically changing IP addresses. Bottom line, you are going to be stuck with a static IP whether you like it or not. Choose one within your subnet but outside your DHCP assignment range. UPDATE: A newer firmware version fixed this and you can use real DHCP.POSITIVES* Once all the above minor issues are resolved, quality and reliability is good so far.  --> Update: My two outdoor Dahuas are are surviving like a champ through the Ohio Winter, which has reached 20 year record lows this year (-15F).* The camera appears to be future-proof with IPv6.* POE is nice.* The frame rate stays consistent around 15fps at the highest resolution (1.3 megapixel) even with multiple machines connected and streaming* Blue Iris PC software easily connects and works perfectly (Blue Iris is awesome).* The popular Android app IP Cam Viewer works with this camera too (a little unreliable but it may be the app)* Viewing video with VLC works great with rtsp://theusername:thepassword@192.168.xx.xx:554/cam/realmonitor. I found this to be extremely important since the camera's web interface doesn't show any video in Firefox or Chrome and the IE ActiveX component it tries to install is rejected by Windows 8 (IE 10). There may be some way to get it to install but using VLC is good enough for me. Because the web interface just showed a picture of a camera and a circle with a line through it, I thought I had a broken camera until a half hour later when I found out the correct URL and tried VLC. [UPDATE: Installing Quicktime enables the live stream in Firefox]* Default automatic video settings seem good to me. For the more picky, there are lots of tweaking options in the interface.SUMMARYInitial setup is not for the faint of heart. If you are a network expert you will be fine. If you are kind of a network novice like me then expect a couple hours of fussing and cursing. If you are average Joe web browser and email user then you can forget ever getting this camera to work. Once things are configured and working this is actually a really nice camera (compared to the unreliable Foscams I have used before stepping up to this one).Note that to power this camera, you will need to purchase a POE injector, POE switch, or DC adapter. What comes in the box is not enough to get up and running.", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Caught a burglar in the act!", "Author": "Chris Wilson", "ReviewID": "R2S994X1WN4EE0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price this camera is great.  If you want good picture quality more than 40 feet away, select a higher resolution camera but this camera knocks the socks off of any analog camera out there with picture quality and dusk picture quality. This one is good enough to read text from a license plate from about 30 feet away, so its a great camera for a front or back door or carport.I installed this camera because I work from home and my neighborhood sees most of its crime during the work hours of the weekdays.  I keep an eye on my front door and carport with this camera because I sometimes cant get to the door to see who is there.  I use blue iris software to monitor my cameras (and record motion events).  Blue iris also allows me to setup motion alerts from the camera.I installed the camera in my carport and within 3 weeks, I caught a burglar in the act of stealing my wheelbarrow and gardening tools out of my carport (some items left outside from my weekend project of cleaning out my garage).  The suspect pulled up into my carport (triggered my BI motion chime) and I went out to confront him and scared him off quickly.  I called 911 and looked back at the video for a suspect and vehicle description.  I was pleasantly surprised that i could easily read the license plate and accurately describe the suspect to 911.  It allowed me to also share the information with our neighborhood crime watch and share his photo with everyone.  The police officer was really impressed with the quality and says he never sees quality this good when reviewing footage of crimes.  He wanted this setup for his own house.  This camera allowed me to catch someone red handed and it avoided me from having to replace $150 of gardening equipment, (so it paid for itself essentially).", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Price Point Solution", "Author": "Reds55", "ReviewID": "R3QS7GHIWOV6FL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been searching for IP cameras that provided a great picture and was accessesable with multiple wireless product(iPad, iPhone, Android Phone...etc).OverviewCamera has a 3.6mm lens.  The camera can be powered locally by a adapter or you can power it vi POE and a POE Switch.  The picture quality is very good.  It provides dual streams.  This is important because it allows you to access the camera from any device while recording it at the highest resolution.  I use stream 1 for recording to a Dahua NVR and access the camera on that stream on an iPad.  I access stream 2 with an android phone.  Took me a while to find the right settings with the internet connection.I have several cameras at a bar facility.  The owner has several different locations with bars.  These cameras allow him to view what he needs using either his phone(Android) or his iPad.I setup the cameras on different http ports.  I started at port 7005.  If you are going to use IP Camera Lite(app for Apple and Android) you will want to use the RTSP options.  For the RTSP port, the default is 554 IF IF the http port is set to 80.  IF you change that HTTP port, you simply add 2000 to get the RTSP port.  So in my setup my HTTP port is 7005, my RTSP port is 9005.  I then setup the router to do port forwarding.Any questions just email me and I will be happy to answer if I can.", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's all in Chinese.", "Author": "Woody", "ReviewID": "R44HJEYD8YF3N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera was shipped from China and I received it in 5 business days. Living on the West Coast probably shortened the shipping time. The paper instructions and CD contents were in Chinese. I saw one file on the CD that was in English which said Setup so I ran that. It installed the client, which I wasn't interested in using, but all the menus and buttons on the Client were in Chinese. I also found a PDF file on the CD but it was in Chinese. I logged into my router and saw the IP the camera was using so I connected to the camera with Internet Explorer and Firefox but  the interface was all in Chinese. I clicked on everything to see if I per chance it would change the interface to use English but I had no luck. I did see the place for the IP info and changed the port 80 to another one but it wouldn't let me. Every time I changed the port it went back to 80. Maybe it would have helped if that menu was in English.I re-packaged the camera and requested a return. Amazon came back with a message that a return needs the sellers approval and I may have to wait up to 48 hours. What a nightmare this has all been! I just requested the return this morning so I will update this post once I find out the outcome.Update:Not long after I posted the above, Amazon emailed me instructions to print the returning mailing label so I assume the seller approved the return. I don't think I should of had to pay the International US Postal shipping back to China for the camera since this was not my fault but the camera is on it's way back. It cost me $22 to ship it which was the cheapest rate. If they had sent me the English version in the first place then all of this could have been avoided. Now I am wondering on how long before my credit card is refunded the amount I paid for the camera.", "Date": "April 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Obnoxious setup process, but very capable high performing camera", "Author": "RainyNW", "ReviewID": "R2SCCAZWJYL3DI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Set up:This camera has a default IP address of 192.168.1.108 and does not use DHCP by default. It also provides no clear indication that the device is powered on (rather than some clicking and brief flashing of IR LED's), which made identifying a bad ethernet cable a big time drain. I am a mac user, so I simply put something on the same subnet to access the camera. You are better off doing this anyway, as the included CD is a mini-CD (does not work in any modern drive worth speaking of) and is a maze of vaguely named compressed files.Once configured for your network, just hop on its web interface (login and password are both \"admin\"), and configure the camera this way. There is even a plug in for Mac OSX Safari, which is great.For those people on dynamic IP addresses (most of us), it also has built in support for various dynamic ip services. All of them appear to be pay only, but this would be good for folks with vacation properties or residences who want to run stand alone camera systems without any extra computers/equipment.One big important thing to note: *No power source is in box*. You can grab just about any old 12V wall wart with a barrel plug and plug it into the split out power connection, but I can't see this being very practical unless you are wanting to splice in some DC wiring in parallel. Instead, the Power over Ethernet (PoE) option is probably your best bet. Pick up an 802.3af injector or a PoE switch and you will be just fine.Camera quality (Day):While I am not an expert on low end security cameras, I can tell you that you will not be disappointed. It just might be the top performing camera in this price range. For day time use, it has great color, very clear resolution, and dynamic range. I can make out the sky and shadowed areas on the ground, without anything washing out. It is a great 1.3MP camera.Camera quality (Night):Okay, wow. Not only did these LEDs light up my entire backyard (about an 1/8 of an acre area), but i could see rain drops when it was raining, bugs flying around at night, airplanes at cruise in the distant sky, and *STARLIGHT*. While not 100% noise free, it was nothing overpowering and enough to get some great resolution to where you could probably read a license plate in pitch black.Events:The camera supports motion events. You get 4 event categories, and each one has its own areas configured on the camera. This way you can reduce sensitivity on moving trees, increase sensitivity in an area that typically has no motion, etc.Events can send emails, however, it does not appear to send attachments with these emails. The event video can be configured to upload onto an FTP server though. I turned on the FTP service on my always-on mac in the house, and it uploads files on each event trigger. Unfortunately, the video format is in .dav and I have not figured out a way to open this just yet.There is also the ability to configure timed events and recording, and perhaps one of these could be configured as a webcam that automatically uploads an image somewhere on the internet. Although you may need some creativity to set one up.Integration:It appears that this integrates well with DVR software and hardware, however, I do not have such a setup.Neat trick for free mobile viewing:This camera allows connections via RTSP (RTSP://), which works great with free programs like VLC (also a free download on iPhone). I liked it better than viewing it in the browser.

I would highly recommend using an NVR to centralize your security system. For some reason (maybe I overlooked something) the SMTP (email) portion of the unit will not send alerts but my Blue Iris box will do so without issue.For the price, these are quality outdoor day/night vision cameras. I can see faces and detail in day and night.Installing these were easy as I used POE to provide power and data over a single run of CAT6 cable.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really difficult to bring into VeraLite", "Author": "agiac", "ReviewID": "RY0L5Y8348UNE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "PHENOMENAL Camera, but almost impossible to bring into VeraLite by myself.

Extensive documentation on the CD that came with it, as well as online.  Being too anxious to get it working, I ignored the docs and simply set my PC to 192.168.1.150, connected the camera to a PoE jack, and then connected to the camera at http://192.168.1.108  I first tried https, before realizing that it might be http.  I wish that it had been https (secure).  Maybe it is an option is the settings.  I check later.  In any case, it was easy to set up and the video quality is very good.  Based on this initial experience, I give it 4 stars.  If it is this good after it it mounted outside, I'll give it five (I hope not less).

There were a ton of english mistakes, as it was obviously written by someone in China with a basic grasp of English. I had to return it because there is no way I'm only using a really old version of IE and all the controls on it barely worked.
