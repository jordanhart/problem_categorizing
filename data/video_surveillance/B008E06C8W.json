It refuses to work, even after a few calls to tech support and even after Amazon sent out a second alarm system (this is the review of the replacement unit I was sent, see my other review for the initial unit)The replacement unit came with the same problem that the initial unit had, it is basically a design flaw that no matter how many you are sent the problem won't go away. The \"keypad\" is a piece of hard plastic and you have to press into it to register a key press. Unfortunately, it can't really tell which button is being pressed. When you try to disarm the system if thinks you want to program the unit, which is a problem as the alarm then goes off, which is especially annoying if you are the first one up and are hoping that your 4 year old will sleep in.In the end I returned the system and went with a Skylink alarm system from Amazon and absolutely love it. The Skylink has real buttons and the setup and programming was incredibly easy. Plus you can arm and disarm it and it works!", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do Not Buy!", "Author": "Somebody \"Somebody\"", "ReviewID": "R3EQFIOQMQAJUG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Very displeased, UNHAPPY, FALSE ADVERTISING ...
