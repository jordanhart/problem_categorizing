I would recommend this item to anyone, and in fact I am buying more today in order to install my fourth camera. I need to monitor my workshop to determine if the cats are going in this winter. They have a cat door and cat houses inside the workshop with heated pads. I rescued a tomcat in the spring and my three original cats are staying out all night sometimes. I can monitor to see that they are safe and warm without going outdoors to check the barn. In regard to this cable, initially I bought this roll and more to monitor the barn entrance, main driveway, and Halloween Display that I put up every year. So far I could not be more pleased.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very weak contacts, broke during instalation, doesn't worth it", "Author": "DSh", "ReviewID": "RLFEUTTCP1L73", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Just lost my money. The picture showed for a minute, then started blinking. Tried to improve the contact and it completely broke. Luckily it was only one of the cables that I installed for my cameras. Used a reserved cable from another company, which was much more solid and worked right away. I will cut this one and remove from the trace once I have a chance. Just lost my time and money.BNC broke inside somewhere near connectors very soon after installation. RCA never worked. I don't think I can cut the end of the cable and attach a new connector, doesn't worth it at all.", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "good cord", "Author": "Hunter", "ReviewID": "RK6RRHOM7LPRO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "good cord but the connections could be better.
