Haven't installed it permanently yet.  Do have it working on a temp basis.Pros:Easy to connect including LAN/internet.Has connection for ext alarm.IR vision at night has a long range.Cons:Mouse TOO sensitive.  Very hard to select individual keys on the virtual keyboard.Interface could benefit from some changes.  Samsung's interface is much better.Motion sensing.  Doesn't work too well.  Detects movement => 5ft from defined area.Manual leaves out a lot of what I'd call important informationTech support.Noticed several times the DVR looses connection to mouse and remote.Switching between color and night time monochrome switches a lot sooner than I'd like to see.Submitted an on-line request for tech support.  Received a response saying it was being transfered to someone else.  Haven't heard anything further.  Have submitted a 2nd request for addition info but is too soon to receive a response.  Only info on the ext alarm is you can set for NO or NC and nothing else (what are voltage and current limits?).  There is a block on the back for 8 sensors but nothing in the manual as to what these sensors are or intended for.The lights on the front of the DVR are a distraction and leads one to have to hide the DVR to keep it from being detected.  This is especially true for the blinking bright red light when the DVR is recording.  Sitting on the shelves with a half doz other black pieces of equipment, the DVR stand out like a sore thumb.On the supplied cameras, I'm not fond of the all plastic design.  Samsung's cameras on a sim priced system are much nicer with having a metal ball and socket mount.Lots of programing capabilities for recording, scheduling and playback.  For searching for playback, you can select time and date.  For recording, you can set the HDD to write over the oldest recording when it gets full, FIFO style.No problems hooking up to internet or connecting to my computer.Will have to wait and see if, when tech support gets back to me.Edit:The system has now been installed.  It's been a couple weeks sine I wrote my initial comments.  As far as tech support goes, 2 stars at most and that's being generous.  After the initial request for support, as I mentioned prior, who ever they handed off my first request to, they have never responded.  Have since requested help a second time, to date there has never been a response from Lorex.One of the questions asked is what kind of sensors are supported.  There are connections for 8 sensors.  I've asked this 3 times and have yet to receive an intelligent answer.At this point I'm going to have to write off the motion detection feature.  The zones you can set up for detecting is all but useless and with the restricted times the motion is to be detected appearing not to work.What a shame for what appears to be a decent piece of equipment turning sour because the support is so poor.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good Quality", "Author": "Kyle", "ReviewID": "RH5HX4SDZI0EF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very good home surveillance system.  Comes with 8 cameras.  While they are not HD cameras, the quality is very good I have to say.  The system itself is easy to setup, the hardest part is getting the wires run through the attic and in place, but obviously that has nothing to do with the actual product itself.  For the cost, the camera is of very good quality.  The iOS App is very handy.  It's not the faster, but overall good quality, even better than some systems that are several times the cost.  My only concern is the hard drive, when doing continuous recording, is not large enough.  You do have the option of upgrading yourself to 2TB hard drive, which will set you back about a hundred bucks.  Very satisfied with the product though, its of good quality.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$615.99", "Features": "8 channel 960h DVR - Real time recording 30fps per channel: 8ch @ full 960H (960 x 480), 16ch @ 480x240\n1 TB DVR HDD - Instant Mobile Viewing on compatible Smart Phones & Tablets\n8 cameras included - Super Resolution Recording\nFree app in apple store, google play, remote connectivity for windows and Mac\nNight vision range up to 130ft (40m) in ambient lighting & up to 90ft (28m) away in total darkness 3", "Name": "Lorex Lh1896 8 Channel 960h Cameras with 1tb DVR Remote Viewing Security Cameras System", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-X3mUkP5L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00F0OMPKO"}}
