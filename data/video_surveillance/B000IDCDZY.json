{"Reviews": [{"Title": "So So", "Author": "xder345 \"xder345\"", "ReviewID": "R2VALDDJD4K87A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was looking for a mount for the baby monitor video camera and this seemed to fit the bill.  It has a lot of mounting options, several extension tube lengths included, so it was easy to get the correct position for the monitor.  It's made with some heavy duty metal, so it feels solid......except for the ballhead it comes with.  It seems like it should work well, but it's the worst, most finicky ballhead I've ever used.  Granted, it was cheap, but getting it to stay in one spot was troublesome.  I should have gone with a GorillaPod or something and mounted the camera directly to the crib rail.  Once you have the ballhead tightened up enough to keep everything in place, do NOT touch it, as any slight bump seems to knock the ballhead loose again.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Title":

It actually exceeded my expectations. I know it's just a simple mounting bracket, but I was actually expecting something much 'chincier' and I wasn't sure if it would even be tall enough. So when it arrived and was a good solid metal and the perfect height you can't help but appreciate when things go your way.I used the Videosecu Camera Mounting Bracket to mount my iPad on a tripod.

It can work which warrants a couple of stars in my book, but not the way you might expect.The main feature of a universal camera mount is the ball joint. This unit does not provide a secure nor easilly adjustable position for an iPad. I can't fathom using this for a ceiling mount as it purports to be useful for. And if it were to be mounted on a desk top or wall, you should not expect this to be easily adjustable. It takes a fair amount of patience and fiddling around to get the unit set the way you want.Here is what I think you might expect that this product lacks:No finished surface on the shaft nor any O-ring against which the ball would rotate if it could be tightened against one or the other. The ball may not be round as well.No compression threads on the shaft or the cylinder that contain the ball to provide an adjustable pressure on the ball, both components you would expect in a ball joint.No secure connection between the wheel you would expect to use to tighten the screw of the mount into a camera or Nootle iPad Tripod Mount. You have to tighten it by turning the shaft or the iPad mount to secure them together.Instead, the designer provides a side thumb screw that requires you to push the cylinder down on the shaft and then tighten to \"lock\" it in place. The plastic wheel on this mount provides no purpose except a stop for the screw.When you think you have it adjusted and secured, if you move it, it immediately becomes loose and can't even support the weight of the screw, much less an iPad. They may as well have skipped the ball joint and given you two heads, a 90 degree and a 180 degree mount.

Neither set screw is designed to touch the sphere.

So first make sure that the smaller allen wrench set screw (2.5mm) is sufficiently backed-off before tightening the thumbscrew.

I figured that I could work around the item's shortcomings.  I had to do so.I formatted this review on my screen.  It may not appear that way on yours.This mount's design concept is adequate.  It is poorly implemented.  Here is why.1)  The ball did not have a smooth surface.  This means that if it was clamped on a ridge point it could slip  down the slope on either side of the ridge into the adjacent valley.  It did so multiple times as I tried  to lock it into place.  This of course destroyed any lock of the ball that I had set.2)  The  locking mechanism relies on the thumb screw contacting a sloped portion of the shaft at 90 degrees  that allows the 360 degree rotation of the mount.  This would have worked well had two things existed in  the design and manufacture of the device.  a)  The tip of the thumb screw was flat as in the tip of a  typical bolt. It should have been round or cone shaped.  b) The flat tip of the thumb screw did NOT come  in contact with the sloped surface of the shaft.  It contacted the largest diameter of the shaft at a  point just above the sloped surface. This made it impossible for the thumb screw to lift the shaft upwards  against the bottom of the ball.  Conversely it made it impossible for the mechanism to pull the collar  downward against the top of the ball so that the bottom of the ball was clamped against the top of the  shaft.3)  I was surprised to find that the collar was not steel.4)  I was shocked to find the threads of the thumb screw stripped after heavy finger torquing while attempting  to get the locking mechanism to actually lock the ball and then hold that lock.  (see comments above for  the reasons for the failure to lock).What I did to fix the problems...1)  I abraded the surface of the ball to remove the ridge/valley irregularities in its surface.2)  I was lucky to be able to replace the thumb screw with a regular bolt. Amazed was I that the collar's  threads were intact enough to hold -- it not being steel. That says something bad about the thumb screw.3)  I carefully and with large expenditure of time and a few metal fragments in my finger tip, rounded the  tip of the replacement bolt.All told I spent about 2 hours bringing this product into a functional condition.You have been warned.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU HAVE THE TIME AND WILL TO DEAL WITH ITS SHORTCOMINGS!One additional note...  The workmanship present in the mount that I received was so shoddy that I am inclinedto suspect that it may be a counterfeit. I have no way to prove or support my suspicion.

Using strong magnets, I was able to secure the mount inside the project box without using screws - the magnets I used (neodymium, from inside an old hard drive) were able hold the mount in place, right through the side of the box.
