For my application outdoors facing southwest at predominantly concrete driveway and road my camera suffered what most of the FI8905W cameras do in bright sun light and that is they flash rapidly between light and dark which made the camera useless to me.  I returned that camera to Amazon.  After looking at the foscam forums I saw that many others had my exact same problem and the only solution anyone had was to purchase the same camera but this time from AVACOMTECH.  I don't know what AVACOMTECH does to modify the camera, but whatever it is I placed the new camera in the exact same location as the first and have not had a single issue with the brightness changing.  With the original camera I had a problem by mid-day on day one.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "works great", "Author": "RobertJ", "ReviewID": "R1C2SAFW2VDKU4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had no problems installing or operating this camera and it works great.
