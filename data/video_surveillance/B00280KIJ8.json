VOLTAGE AND CURRENT ALLOWED FOR SECURITY CAMERA APPLICATIONS. I BELIEVE THAT THE WIRE SIZE WITH ONLY THREE CONDUCTORS INSIDE AND OUTER JACKET INSULATION IS INFERIOR TO AMERICAN MADE WIRE AND IS VERY FRAGILE TO HANDLE. IT IS VERY PRONE TO DAMAGE BECAUSE OF IT'S CONSTRUCTION AND MINISCULE SIZE. WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE FACTS THAT MOST OF THESE INSTALLATIONS FOR C.C.T.V. CAMERAS ARE GOING TO BE OUTDOOR INSTALLATIONS AND THEREFORE THE WIRING WILL BE EXPOSED TO THE SUN'S UV RAYS AND OTHER WEATHER RELATED FACTORS, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY COULD NOT MAKE THESE CABLE SETS A LITTLE MORE HEAVY DUTY AND PLACING THE WIRING INTO A PROTECTIVE BARRIER LIKE CONDUIT OR PLASTIC TUBING SHOULD NOT BE NECESSARY. ALSO THE WIRE SETS ARE PACKAGED IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT TAKES QUITE A LENGTHY TIME TO UNTANGLE THE WIRES FOR PROPER INSTALLATION PURPOSES INITIALLY. ONE MUST BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN INSTALLING THIS WIRING ON THE EXTERIOR OF BUILDINGS MAKING SURE THAT THE WIRE BENDS ARE NOT TOO SHARP OF A RADIUS AND ALSO EXTREME CAUTION MUST BE USED WHEN CABLE STAPLING OR OTHERWISE SECURING THIS WIRING. IT IS A GOOD QUALITY PRODUCT AS FAR AS PICTURE RESOLUTION IS CONCERNED, BUT SURELY IT IS THE BARE BONES MINIMUM IN QUALITY WIRE AND LEAVES A WHOLE LOT TO BE DESIRED.
