{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A quality product that works as advertised", "Author": "Karl Keller", "ReviewID": "R1S53G3JO495WG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Since receiving this product five days ago, I've put the pen thru its paces and with the exception of one issue (see below), everything works as advertised.PROs:  - This is a very nice feeling pen  - It's a little bigger (as in thickness) than the pens I'm normally used to but not to the point of feeling awkward in the hand.  - The picture quality is good considering the size of the pen and believe is great considering the cost and size of the pen  - The video is a little hazier than I would have liked but still considering everything is very good  - The audio was clear and didn't have any problems understanding conversationsCONs:  - My biggest complaint is the instructions on how to set the time and date (#7) were very confusing and I haven't been able to get it changed so far.  This is the ONLY reason I didn't give the pen a rating of 5.  If I'm able to figure this issue out and actually be able to make the changes I will post an update and would have no problem changing my rating to a 5.  - This is a little nit picky but the grammar isn't the best and could be improved.  Not a show stopper to purchasing the pen by any means but it made reading some of the instructions a little choppy.  - Not a Con per se, but make sure that whatever is behind the pen is not shiny or reflective as the light when it blinks can be seen, especially in dim or dark conditions  One note of caution, be aware of what the laws are where you are when you choose to use the pen when not everyone knows they're being videotaped/recorded.  In some locations, it's legal to record an event when only one of the parties present knows while other locations (States), require ALL parties to be told that they're being videotaped/recorded.  Overall... I really like this product and would recommend anyone looking for something like this. If I can change the time and date this pen would be home run.  Until I can figure out how to do that, it's a triple.============================UPDATE: June 5, 2013  After failing to figure out how to set the time and date I finally sent an email to Adfilic asking for some help.  They were awesome in responding to my question.  I believe that any response in less than 24 hours is great... well, I got mine in less than 2 hours.  Customer Service, not to mention the answer to my question, has changed my review from a 4 to a 5!!!  I've cut and pasted the response I got regarding how to change the time and date.  I'm sure most other people were able to figure it out by themselves but for those that are instruction-challenged like me, here you are:\"To change the time and date, you first have to connect the USB cable to both the pen and computer. Once you've done that a USB hard drive will appear in your computer. In the hard drive you will find a text file labeled as time. Open it and type in the year, month, day, time then click save under the file tab. Close it and unplug the USB cable and the date and time should be changed.\"", "Date": "June 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fun \"toy\" actually is a great little camera!", "Author": "Tom Cat", "ReviewID": "R3O5SXP81N7NJN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Does it match the video you take with a dedicated hand held device?

The lightweight and stylish form is one of a kind and blows the competition because this one just is obviously better crafted and of higher quality.This Spy Pen Camera even has a tiny dvr recorder that supports 16gb SD card I have and was easier than any other to use. I do not recommend you drop it but as a matter of fact this little gadget fell out of my child's hand and to my surprise did not break. That is obviously a plus I did not expect but can live with.has multiple functionsAnother thing is after I use the video camcorder, I playback the footage on my laptop and since I love to use it for still images, the images are all very crisp and clear plus the video is even better with the quality in picture and sound.I am glad I set eyes on this Spy pen camera and appreciate the fact that it has way surpassed my initial expectations and has delivered considerably more that I could imagine-could you believe that it includes the usb cable also which without would have cost me a long trip to the mall. I'm starting to love this spy pen camera and actually have it on me all day because of it's easy portability and discrete nature.If you're on the fence or simply undecided on purchasing a spy pen camera then I sincerely believe your worries are over with this one; it's compact, lightweight, easy to handle, discrete, durable and low price are what makes it stand out above and beyond the competition. Last but not least, I feel comfort that if for some reason it stopped working I can get a refund.

I've filed numerous complaints with the facility and the Long Term Care Ombudsman, but the staff lie to cover up their poor performance and nothing changes.I had a bit of trouble understanding how to get the device into \"standby\" mode, so I emailed the seller.  He was extremely helpful and polite, answering my emails within minutes.  He sent me a quick-start guide that shows exactly, step-by-step, how to charge the unit, set the time and use it.  I'm not the most tech-savvy person, but these directions were simple and easy to follow.My first pictures were a bit blurry, but I think that's because I was trying to focus on something too close.  The pictures turned out much better at a distance of 12 inches or more.  The video was very clear.  I don't think the quality is quite what I've come to think of as high definition, but it's certainly more than adequate for my needs.  I wouldn't expect it to look like something recorded with an expensive movie camera and studio lighting.  Aiming the device is slightly challenging, but I believe it just takes a bit of practice.A note to consider:  be sure you're aware of the laws in the state where you're planning to use this item.  I know that my state doesn't allow audio recording unless one party is aware of being recorded.  That works for us, because mom and I will be the ones using the device.

When it arrived, I went to set it up, but was concerned cause I have three computers (Windows 2002 XP, Vista, and Windows 7) and the box said it required 2000 XP.  Well I tried it but it did not work - booo.  The light came on, but I got an error message on all three of my computers.  I thought it was the operating system, so I wrote to the seller to find out if there was a software upgrade for it.  The seller was super helpful and gave me some tips which I tried.  Then had more questions, so I wrote again and they gave me more info, both times responding pretty quickly to my surprise.  Here's some info that other buyers should know:- The pen DOES WORK on newer PC operating systems, including Windows 7.- Make sure the mini-SD memory card is pushed all the way in the slot.  Mine was not in all the way and it went in at least 1/16\" more and made a click/snap sound.- Plug it into the USB port on the BACK of the computer, instead of one in the front (I'd heard this regarding other USB attachments because apparently the front USB ports have a lower charge - I don't know what's up with that and it doesn't make any sense to me since those are more convenient, but whatever).- Make sure a light comes on.  If not, press the button at the top (duh, felt stupid about missing that one).- If a light still doesn't come on, it might be a defective cable.  The cable is fine if a red or green light comes on.- Red light means it's charging.  The first time you plug the pen into your computer, you have to download some software and you can do that when the battery is charging.  It doesn't have to be fully charged (green light) to download it.- If you check the SD card, plug it in the back USB port, the light comes on (meaning the cable is fine), but you get an error message saying, \"USB Device Not Recognized\" - then unfortunately, the pen is most likely broken or defective.Since I work in quality control, I know that defective items are a normal part of the manufacturing process.  I read some reviews here that people thought the item itself was horrible because it didn't work, but honestly they just got a bad one.  If I got a damaged item from Target or Walmart, I wouldn't call it a rip off, I'd exchange for one that works.  So that's what I did.  But I notice that when people buy stuff online, it's like they feel personally attacked or something.  Geez, just let the seller know - afterall, they can't test every single item they sell.So, after doing the things I listed above, I told the seller about the error message.  They understood the problem immediately and confirmed the pen was probably defective and unable to recognize the SD card.  They apologized and said they'd send me a new pen right away.  It was probably the easiest and best experience I've had with an online seller.Happy Ending:  I got my new pen within a week and it worked right off the bat.  It really is a neat little toy and my nephew and I had a lot of fun pretending to be spies.  The quality of the video and audio was surprisingly good for such a tiny camera hole, so calling it a \"toy\" doesn't do it justice.  It's a fun item and I'm very happy with it, and especially how great the seller was about everything.", "Date": "September 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great back to school gift", "Author": "Pete", "ReviewID": "R33AQWAPLDYPL0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This spy pen is really cool.

The 8GB free SD card that comes with the pen is also a great added bonus for extra recording minutes.Overall I highly recommend this spy pen if you are looking for a fun gadget to play around with or if you are a serious spy then this spy pen is definitely for you!", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Secret Agent Man", "Author": "Mike \"Mike\"", "ReviewID": "R6TF9J3LWBZ9Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This thing is awesome! I mean, I'm sitting here typing this, giggling to myself and I'm darn-near 57 yrs old-! I took it out of the box, quickly charged it and within an hour ran out to meet some friends at happy hour.

But I just can't believe that I can do things now that 007 couldn't do back in the late 60's! This great.Anyway, I do have a pointer. When the unit arrived, I noticed that the memory card wasn't quite seated in all the way in. I pushed it in about 1/16\" until it seated and then was able to access the time settings on my computer.I can imagine folks not noticing this and sending the unit back to the seller thinking it's non-functional.

All ready to get things going I dove into getting this camera cranked up... but the instructions didn't deliver what I had hoped for.  Taking pictures was fine, but getting the video figured out took a little work as my interpretation of what was written just didn't produce results for recording.  So, I contacted the seller and they were quick to respond to my inquiry and assist, which was very nice.Hopefully they will redo the instructions soon, or post improved directions online with a link in one of their follow up \"tips\" emails that they send after purchase.For those that get the same instructions I got, here is what I found was needed to get the pen to take pics and record:Once the unit is on in Camera mode:To take picture, press top button once quickly, then release (as the instructions say)To shut off, press until 3 green blinks followed by red blink, then release (likewise, as instructions say)To record in video (when on and in camera mode), press top button until you see the first green blink, release button immediately (green light will continue to blink for total of 3 times, but there will be NO red blink), light just goes dark, but video is now recording. (Instructions indicate the light will blink slowly while recording, but my light didn't blink at all)To shut off video, press top button until you see a green blink followed by a red blinkIf the instructions had been better written and saved a little aggravation I would have given this a 5 star rating since I love using this little rascal.  So handy to be able to carry around a video camera in your pocket totally discreetly and with such a light weight.  You never know when you might want to document something on a casual basis.  Oh, and the quality of the pics and video is pretty good as long as you have reasonable lighting and don't move around too much, just as with any camera.

It provides a great quality digital video recorder and comes with a free 8gb SD card, which this pen can hold up to 16gbs. Unfortunately, Most Spy Pens don't provide the SD card for saving and capturing the moments your taking. However, this Spy Pen does!Charging light is on, plugged into computer with the USB cord.The hidden camera gives you a great viewing of the video seen on the computer, after you record. The pen takes a great length of 320 minutes of video footage and you can save up to 48,000 photos on this pen when using a 16 gb SD micro card. The format is AVI which is perfect for everyone who wants to share their videos and pictures right away. One thing, you won't have any problem setting this Spy Pen up! I was easily able to spy on my family without them evening noticing, and connecting it to my laptop with the USB cord( included).The footage was wonderful and It really can take everything heard around the room and mentioned when I was spying. After attaching it to your computer or taking the SD card and placing it into a reader,  you'll be able to share these videos and photos with others on your favorite social networks and through email.The manual you receive is easy to read and simple to setting your Spy CamPen up. The USB cord also acts as the charger, so once your pen is losing power you just plug it in your computer's USB slot and it's charging again.This pen has been given pretty good ratings all the time by everyone who uses it. It is top of the line and not your child's toy! You will be impressed with this product and with my full honesty, you won't be disappointed! I really think it's fun and a creative techy gadget that everyone should enjoy!This absolutely changed my opinion to small cameras being functional as a real life camera. You can see a full viewing of the recording and no flashing light to give the person beside you a strange look.
