{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good picture quality, lots of features and options", "Author": "J. Green", "ReviewID": "R3U7T4OWYDMGJM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very nice and complete home or small business security system.  I have the 8 camera package but I notice it also comes with just 4 (which would have been enough for my home).  The 500GP hard drive DVR unit needs to be located in a central place since the cameras are hard-wired and will need to radiate out from there.  The cables for the cameras are about 50' long, and are included with them.  I think I would have preferred wireless, which would be much easier to set up, but that would probably be more expensive.  The DVR can be connected to a computer monitor or HD television and comes with a mouse which makes it easy to use.Setup wasn't difficult using just the color manual, but there are also online videos if needed.  Cameras can be set up to either record during certain hours or use the default motion detection feature.  You can even set it up to email you when motion is detected.  This might be a very useful feature for a business but turned out not to be useful for the cameras I set up at home, as I was getting too many emails.  There is also an app for the iPhone that allows you to view the cameras and a cable is included to connect it to your router, but I didn't try it.  But overall, the computer interface is very easy to use.The cameras are very good and I was impressed with the quality of the picture - even better than the Defender Digital Wireless DVR Security System I already have been using.  Picture is in color during the day and the nighttime vision looks like b&w.;  But since it is not wireless you need to put some thought into where you'll be locating everything and where to run the cables.  But for the price, this is a very good and quality security system.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great for night, long recording time, remote viewing", "Author": "Flaherty", "ReviewID": "R13NA133K56KD7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm opening up a small specialized car dealership and this came in extremely handy. We tested it out last night and the night recording was very good. The eight cameras cover enough of the small property to scare away potential thieves and vandals, as well as proving us with 24/7 peace of mind by being able to check on the lot anytime. Set up took a couple of hours because we read everything and made sure that everything was 100% the way we wanted it. At this price, I was impressed with the quality and do not think you can get a better system for anywhere near this price. The recordings are actually better that at the large dealership one of our team was working at, so we are completely happy and like the fact that we can upgrade individual components as the technology gets better.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "This Swann set + a computer or HD TV is all you need for home surveillance!", "Author": "Patrick Regan \"Patrick Regan\"", "ReviewID": "R3UF1FMO9Y3W23", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Swann SWDVK-825558 DVR and camera set is a very powerful set of surveillance equipment. The set, which I was able to set up in 45 minutes or so, can connect to a HDTV or an old style PC VGA monitor or can be connected to a router and be watched on your flat screen PC or Mac. I set the Swann up to run on my HDTV (a Visio) and encountered no problems. The DVR is programmed to only record when movement is noticed by default. After I set up the cameras, I noticed that when I passed my hand in front of one, its image on the TV screen flashed an icon indicating that movement had been detected making it easy to see when the DVR was recording. The Swann is set up to email you whenever movement it detected, so, even when you are away from your house, you can be aware of what is going on there. The cameras, (8 of them come with this set) are powerful enough to make details clear. They also are capable of recording in color. I found the user interface of DVR software to be easy and intuitive to use, especially with the mouse that comes with the system. I definitely recommend this home surveillance kit to anyone who would like to have better security at their house.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good and fairly easy to set up video security system", "Author": "Alain B. Burrese \"Author, Speaker, Mediator, ...", "ReviewID": "R12ZUYAY49QU2W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Swan SWDVK-825558-US 8-Channel DVR and 8 x 540 TVL Cameras is a great video home security system.  It is packaged in three units, and I believe you can purchase separately. These include the Swan Advanced Security System 8 Channel Digital Video Recorder and two packages of the Swan Pro-510 Security Cameras with IR Cut Filter.The DVR has a 500GB Hard Drive, HDMI cable, power adapter, remote control, software CD, USB mouse, Ethernet cable, Theft Deterrent Stickers and the operating instructions. The box of cameras includes 4 cameras, 4 extension cables (around 60 feet long), 4 wall plugs/screws. 1 power adapter with 4 way power splitter, 4 more security stickers, and the operating manual. (Since I got 8 cameras, there were two of these four pack boxes.) There are also videos to help you set up on the Swann website if you have trouble with setting up from the manual.  The manual is pretty clear, but could be simpler and I think the videos are a nice feature if you can go on-line and watch them. (Note, the videos I watched were for a different model, but close enough.)The cameras are very easy to connect to the DVR and the DVR connects to monitors or television. For best picture, connect to a HD television. A key here is selecting a central place for your DVR and monitor. Because you then have to run the cables to the cameras from this position. (You will also need an outlet for the DVR and an outlet for each set of four cameras.)The most difficult thing for this setup is installing the cameras.  Not that they are that difficult, but you do need to determine where you want to place them, and if you mount them you must use a drill (three holes) and use the mounting screws and anchors (if needed), as well as hiding the cables or securing them out of the way. I have not determined just where I want the cameras and how to run the cables so they are least obtrusive, so mine are not permanently fixed yet.The picture is clear both night and day, and I was surprised at the clarity with the night vision. You can view and record up to all 8 cameras. You can hook the included mouse to the DVR and use it to help you set everything up on the screen of your monitor or TV.There are a variety of features that are explained in the manual and in he on-line videos. You will have to learn to record, playback, search, use the motion detector feature, send e-mail alerts, etc. None of these are that complicated.This system has the capability for remote viewing if you download the app to your smart phone or tablet, but I have not done that, so I can't comment on this feature.Overall, this is a very good video security system for the home or small business. The limitations are only with the length of the camera cables (I'm not sure if they make wireless DVR/Camera systems, but that would be great, but probably much more expensive.) and the size of the hard drive, although 500GB will hold quite a bit. (The box says 15 days of recording, but I have not tried it out to max the hard drive out to test it.) Some homes and small businesses won't need all 8 cameras, but it is nice to have that capability and have the extras in case one breaks or fails.  Very good and fairly easy to set up video security system.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "An Absolutely Fantastic, Easy to Set Up and Use Security System", "Author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "ReviewID": "R2DC7PPXS12EQV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Swann Advanced Security System is a great system! They say DIY \"easy installation\" and they are not kidding. Out of the box, I had two cameras connected, the software installed on my laptop, and was watching myself and another room of the house in 30 minutes. It's really that easy. If I was in a small apartment or office I could have had myself fully secured in another hour at most, with cameras on my door and others in my office, waiting room or living room (unless I wanted to run the camera cables through the wall, which would require some drilling). How can you beat that?They even provided an Ethernet cable to connect the DVR to the router, though be warned it's a bit short. so I used a spare I had instead. But that is not much of a complaint when all is said and done (I just have too many things close to my router already but you might have no problem with the cable provided). The DVR also comes with a remote control (and batteries) and a mouse. The cord for the mouse is, once again, a bit short, but you can use a wireless mouse by plugging the receiver into the USB port meant for the mouse.The computer interface is well designed and the instructions (see below) provide step by step directions for choosing the settings that will work best for you (including things like resolution and frame rate). The images on my laptop were very clear. I had the opportunity to test the cameras in the dark. In my library, with very limited ambient light, the books on my shelves showed up so brightly I could read the titles. Taking a camera into a bathroom and closing the door made the images seem as bright as if there was a light shining in there. It is truly amazing how well these cameras work in the dark.I have not permanently installed any of the cameras because I will have to decide where to put them (I have eight available). They are easy to attach, using three screws apiece. I am thinking about hiring a local electrician or seeing what Swann would charge for installation because of having to run the camera cables.The cables that come with the cameras are about 50-60 feet long, which should provide some flexibility with regards placement of the cameras. I could easily place the DVR in my living room and cover most of the house, if not all of it. You can set up one camera, plugging it directly into the DVR or you can use a splitter (provided) to hook up cameras in groups of four, up to eight total on this DVR. The process is very simple and takes seconds. The cameras themselves can be angled by loosening any of three screws, adjusting, and re-tightening the screws. The cameras seem very sturdy.The DVR is 500GB, enough for 15 days of continuous recording and you can extend that by setting your cameras to record only when they detect movement. You can also copy footage in AVI format (click this option in settings) onto your computer hard drive, or back it up using a flash drive. Using an app you can monitor your system via cell phone (Android or iPhone) or 3G or 4G enabled tablet (Android or iPad) so you can check things out when you're not at home. I have not been able to test out the app yet but I am waiting for my Samsung Android replacement for my old Samsung Windows phone (which is supported by NOBODY) and will be able to play around with it then. I will also download the app to my tablet (again, will update my review).The instructions are easy to follow (there is a book in English and a booklet in Spanish). The booklet is 59 pages long  but don't be intimidated. It is very well illustrated (in color), the explanations are clearly stated, and best yet it has a handy table of contents (I was able to flip right to the section on installing the DVR on a PC).After the section on connecting the DVR the instruction book is divided into two main sections, Basic Setup and Advanced Configuration explaining \"professional grade capabilities\" that are completely optional. The instructions that came with the cameras are also easy to follow and I had no problem connecting the cameras. I was very impressed, given how poorly some instructions are written these days. You won't have any problem here, I assure you.I am very excited about the Advanced Security System and I cannot wait to test out its full capabilities. I am in a master's program studying cybersecurity, so I have become very security conscious (including physical security). I would recommend the Swann Advanced Security System to anyone wishing to protect their home or business and I will certainly recommend it to a local doctor who asked me for information about just this sort of thing a couple of weeks ago.(As an added note, they provide a bunch of little stickers to put up on your windows and doors. Between what came with the DVR and the cameras, I can put one on each door and window.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$549.99", "Features": "Set & forget by recording continuously from 8 channels for 15 days+ onto a massive 500GB hard drive, even longer with motion detection\nSave time & have peace of mind by easily locating incident video, then transfer to external storage via USB, eSATA or network\nSetting up remote viewing has never been easier with Swann's 'My DVR' customizable network configuration\nSurveillance in the palm of your hand with live viewing on 3G/4G-enabled Smartphones & tablets including iPhone, iPad, Android devices, BlackBerry devices and more*, and remote notification via email", "Name": "Swann SWDVK-825558-US 8-Channel DVR and 8 x 540 TVL Cameras (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41k7jYt0cpL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DGE4WV0"}}
