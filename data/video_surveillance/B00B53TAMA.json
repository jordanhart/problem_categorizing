{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Defective Dahua Product", "Author": "ayoub yaacoub", "ReviewID": "R1GBSMPCV2D5MM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am a CCTV system integrators.  I purchased a number of these units for a hospital project. We purchased 32 channels DVR, several 32 channel hybrid 960, one 32 channel hybrid D1, and one 16 Channel NVR 5series.I was initially impressed with this product.  Dahua family of products can be accessed from the same Software platform. We looked at Demos online, and asked all the right questions about the product; all checked out, until the day we deployed 6 of these DVR\u2019s and one the NVR unit.Below are my finding:1. Dahua does NOT allow you direct hardware/firmware support. You have to get your firmware updates from a Dahua re-seller, and if you are buying from amazon, good luck knowing your reseller. Assume you know your reseller; chances are he a small margin with no interest in after sale support. It has been a total struggle for us to get firmware upgrade.2. Hybrid DVR Settings are not stable, upon power loss, settings do change, and that's not good. Unfortunately The way you learn about setting changes is when you go to playback records. You realize that the DVR record settings have changed..and  you basically have no records of an important event.3. The CMS software/platform has an amazing GUI. the Smart PSS is a great software but when it comes to playback it is a total hit and miss especially if you are trying to perform Playback for more than 4 cameras at the same times. The software has major issues downloading events for playback, and as it does it hangs, so you have to keep on trying over and over.4.Dahua makes another software platform called PSS. PSS is limited to playback of 4 cameras at the same time, yet it support 32 channels hardware.5. When using Dahua smart PSS for live viewing, you can drag your DVR or site icon and drop it into the live viewing grid and the software live stream all the cameras. If you have 18 cameras on the system, only 16 will stream. 17 and 18 will not automatically load. You need to manually logon into each camera beyond camera 16.5. Password security is a joke.

It is 700+ pages of uncategorized Q&A.; I posted my issues; they were never published and dahua never wrote back to me.7. I contacted my reseller for support, and my issues are beyond their technical capabilities. The generic answer, the new generation product will not have this issue. Basically go upgrade a 3 months old product.Overall this product is ahead of its time and competitions in features and innovation, WHEN it works. It has not proven to me that it works. In my professional opinion, the entire product line is not mature and it is being release in beta stages. Furthermore, the company is not interested in any kind of after sale support.We will try to get these issues fixed, but I am not optimistic. My feelings are that we will have to eat the cost, cut our losses, and move on to another product.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00B53TAMA"}}
