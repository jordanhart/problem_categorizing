The problem with those is that they use hearing aid batteries which run down quickly and cost nearly $10 to replace.

Fraz Ahmed", "ReviewID": "R568TRZOAV8U4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There's only so much you can expect from a stand-alone wireless door alarm device. Is it loud enough to wake you and your neighborhood. Yes, That it is. and just judging from the intensity and volume, it can be quite the deterrent. The alarm is easy enough to install, though the keypad being only 4 buttons only leaves you with enough combinations, but in the nick of things it should prove to be enough. Its easy enough to set up, the magnet can be screwed or stuck on with included double sided tape. However it also depends on what kind of door jam and border you have. My door jam had a rounded bezel at the edge which meant i had to either stick it on the rounded edge which wasn't very stable, or stick it a little farther away where it was flatter, only problem is then it wouldn't work because the magnet has to be less than half an inch from the edge of the alarm.Aside from those issues, the alarm does what it's supposed to. that is make a very loud noise. It has delayed alarm settings which gives you 45 sec from when you arm it, and enough time to leave the house. and 30 seconds when you re-enter to punch in the code before it goes off. So simple enough interface, works in instant mode as well, for when you're at home. and someone enters, the alarm goes of instantly with no delay. This instant mode can be switched to a door chime mode as well. but it is really loud even in door chime mode, and it does not come with a volume adjuster.Being standalone battery operated, the battery is rated to last a few months before it needs replacement. it will begin flashing when its running low. Also its small form factor allows it to be placed anywhere. I would recommended placing the alarm at an odd place where it would still work when the door is opened, but not be in the usual place where anyone can see or expect it easily.For those who cant afford a security subscription service, this works quite well as a basic deterrence. Within seconds of a break in it will blast a sound around 120db waking anyone in the vicinity, especially if its an apartment building, leaving the intruder no choice but to flee immediately. And that could be the difference.UPDATE: I've used this device for 2 years now, and only replaced the battery once very recently.

The door knob we have is a handle/latch type knob.  Due to the type of mechanism involved with the dead bolt, when the door is opened from the inside, the deadbolt will open as well.  This is not ideal when you have a 1 year old who can reach the door handle and run out to the street in seconds.  It took me just a few minutes to install.  I opted for the double sided tape because we live in military family housing and will have to pay for \"damaging\" the door.The chime is pretty loud, I can hear it all over the house although it might be difficult if you had a second floor or are in the shower.  The alarm is no joke, nearly scared me to death!  It will be great to keep pesky housing maintenance people out of my home when i'm not there.  Definitely loud enough to scare away an intruder.The lid to the battery compartment does require a tiny screw driver to open and close.  This is great because if an intruder comes in and wants to just remove the batteries he can't.  He'd pretty much have to smash it to turn it off.I also like that the magnet for the alarm can be on either side of the main unit.", "Date": "January 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent for the money", "Author": "Derek A. Wade \"Derek A. Coach Wade\"", "ReviewID": "R2RSEDXZ54469S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let's be honest, this isn't an ADT monitored alarm system. It's a simple deterrent for the novice thief. I've read some truly ridiculous complaints about this thing.I got mine as part of a home security kit including three window alarms. Each item works flawlessly as designed.If there is molding around the door, the sensor or the magnet will be at a strange angle. This has no affect on operation. It's purely aesthetic. I simply mounted the alarm unit to the door itself and the magnet is on the door frame (molding).Yes, a thief could yank this off the door, smash it on the ground, and make off with your TV. However, you are completely overlooking that the thief has no way of knowing what type of alarm system you have. When he hears the alarm go off, all he's going to be thinking is, \"Oh no!\" He has no way of knowing whether or not your alarm is monitored. (ProTip: run a search for 'monitored alarm sign' here on Amazon. You'll find signs ranging from $3.95 to $20 that will indicate that your home alarm is monitored. When the siren goes off, the thief is not going to hang around to discover that your sign is lying!)Some people have also complained about the thirty second disarm time \"Giving the burglar time to find and destroy the alarm.\" Thirty seconds is the industry standard for such alarm modules, and odds are once he hears the reminder beep, he's going to be hightailing it, especially if he thinks the alarm is being monitored.I had the alarm unpackaged, code set, and installed within ten minutes. It took me longer to find a screwdriver to get into the battery compartment. (The battery compartment is sealed to prevent a thief from yanking out the batteries to silence the alarm.)Let's be honest, folks, alarm systems will only deter the average thief. An expert homebreaker will be in and out of your house in a few minutes, bypassing or ignoring even the best alarms. But that's not what we're trying to do here.

You can't set, and leave thru the door.If you set it to alarm, and away, it goes off on a countdown.  You can set, and leave thru the door.But...In my usage, it is installed inside her room.  If it were installed outside the room, it could easily be disabled by someone with bad intentions.From inside her room, I set the alarm to away, enter the code to arm the alarm, open the door, exit close the door.  If an intruder were to open the door, it makes a beep.  It then goes to a 45 second countdown before the alarm goes off.  The intruder has a window to disable the alarm.  You could easily crush this with your boot, drop it in water, muffle it possibly.  Either way, if someone knows of this alarm, or can think quickly, it will never go off.The other reason this isn't for me - say I want to enter her room to check on her while she is sleeping, while it's armed.  I open the door, close the door, press the disarm code.  Pressing these buttons is pretty loud and wakes her up and anyone in a room nearby.What I have learned is I need an alarm that goes off in my bedroom or wherever I happen to be in the house.This review isn't critical of the product, just merely stating I bought the wrong produce for my needs.

I can hear the alarm in any part of the house, but it doesn't pierce my ears, so maybe it's the setting my husband put it on.(Update: we have it on CHIME mode.  With that mode, it is loud but not piercing.  Also, with the chime mode which is on the right side of the unit, you don't have to set and reset the alarm code.  If you open the door, alarm chime goes off, but then it stops.  It just lets you know when somebody is going through the door.  If you set it on ALARM mode, you will have to set the code and unset it each time if you don't want it going off, so I suggest you use this if you want it as a burlgar alarm and the chime mode if you simply want to know if the door is being opened.

I came on here fully prepared to give this product a 5 star rating, but then I read the review by Daryl Gates, who makes an excellent point! This alarm makes a loud beep when the door has been opened on \"away\" mode, which is meant to alert to the owner that you have 30 seconds to put in the code before the alarm goes off. However, if someone were breaking in, that would alert them that there was an alarm on the door and, it being a small plastic product, it could very easily be removed and completely disabled before the 30 seconds was up and the alarm sounded. TOO BAD. Otherwise, this product is leaps and bounds better than the last door alarm that we had and would definitely wake us up out of a dead sleep if someone were to break into our house in the middle of the night. When it is on \"home\" mode, it goes off the second the door is opened, and therefore I'm still very pleased with my purchase. I'm much more worried about the safety of my family than the security of my belongings, so if it were on \"away\" mode, that would mean we were all gone and my family would be safe from anyone with bad intentions. (Besides, we usually leave through the garage door - on which we use one of the more basic GE door alarms, so leaving it on \"home\" mode 100% of the time, is a perfectly reasonable option for us.)

The holes for the screws in the unit are too small for most homeowner on-hand screws, and I didn't want to drill out the openings in the plastic more.

I would recommend it to a friend.  The only con, which I attribute justifiably to the price, are that there is no intermittent beeping of the alarm when you open the door during an \"away\" setting.  That is, when you come home, and the alarm is armed on away, usually you unlock the door and open it, and you hear a slow, metronomic beeping to help you remember that the alarm is armed.  Then after a period of time, if not disarmed, the real alarm would go off.  This alarm does not have that feature.  But that is a minor thing, and for the price, I don't think it's a big deal.

I like that it comes with double backing tape also because the screws for the magnet were too long for my door frame. It was pretty easy to set up and install but the only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because the alarm and the magnet have to be super close to work. Most door frames have ridges which made it a little tricky to set up without the alarm pad being literally right up along the edge of the door.
