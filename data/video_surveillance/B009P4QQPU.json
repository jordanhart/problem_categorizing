{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Image But Cannot See in the Dark", "Author": "Augsburg57", "ReviewID": "R3F05SS1068NG4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is very small and unobtrusive.  The base is only about 4 inches in diameter and the camera dome is no more than 3 inches tall.  The image is pretty good, definitely better than the 720p bullet camera I have from Q-See.The camera comes with no printed directions, but does include a CD disk with a manual.  There's lots of info. on Q-See's website, but it is very poorly organized and its hard to tell what is current info.  Much of the following, I figured out on my own.  For example, inexplicably, the manual does not tell you to remove the dome to adjust the orientation of the camera.I had no problems getting the image right side up (like another reviewer did).  If you did have a problem, log on to the camera as described below and there are settings to reverse or mirror the image.  The lens is a fairly wide angle, so plan on using the camera for subjects fairly close (it works best with subjects 10 to 25 feet or so, and not 60+ feet away).To adjust the orientation of the camera, you will need to remove the dome by unscrewing the three hex head screws (accessible from the exterior dome side of the camera).  Careful, the screw's threads strip VERY easily.  You will want to remove the dome to mount the camera to a surface and play with orientation after it is mounted in place.The camera has a microSD slot, which I have not used.Unlike with many bullet cameras, there is no IR on this dome camera.  This means you can see at night - but only with the right lighting conditions.  I first tried the camera aimed out to the street (30 to 50 feet away) to keep an eye on my parked car (which sits under an LED street light) - but I found that was too far away and that anyone walking around the car at night was too backlit at that distance to make out clearly.  I then installed the camera on the soffit of my front porch aimed at my front door - which is about 10 feet away.  I do have an overhead porch light on at night.  In this location, the camera works great, maintaining a good color image, even at night.I have the camera connected (with another) to a Netgear ProSafe POE switch (model GS108PE), which then connects to my network (Apple Airport Extreme, 1st Gen.).  I record with a Q-See QC808 NVR, also connected to the network.The camera has a firmware update (available on Q-See's website) to correct connectivity problems with Macs.  You can log directly onto the camera to make the update and change settings using a browser - Safari and Bonjour in my case.  With a Mac, to see your Bonjour devices, go to Safari Preferences, Bookmarks, check \"Include Bonjour\" under \"Bookmarks Bar\"  You will see Bonjour in your Bookmarks Bar and can click to see the camera listed under Webpages.  My cameras shown up this way under the TCZ# that is printed on a sticker on the camera.  Use the camera's default password \"admin\" to log on to the camera the first time.  Q-See has detailed instructions on the firmware update on their website.", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good picture quality for security", "Author": "greenmantis", "ReviewID": "RESP504C0TE1M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Mounting the camera was the camera and configurations were moderately difficult. It took me about 4 hours to get the camera set up. Once that was done, I was satisfied with the result. I mounted the camera under the overhang of my front door. With the wide view angle, I am able to rotate the camera and get a good view of my doorstep, then also rotate back to get a good view of my mailbox and driveway. The best quality setting isn't quite good enough for me to get license plates in my driveway, but is good enough to make out heads/faces of people on my doorstep. I've been trying to get this to work with the IP Cam Viewer app for iOS, but still haven't figured that out yet. I'll update if I get it figured out.", "Date": "May 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good if you spend some time with it.", "Author": "J.

I just have a hard time seeing the value in a network IP based camera vs a CCTV one. CCTV cameras are pretty inexpensive, as are CCTV dvrs and or cards to turn your PC into a CCTV dvr, it seems like that is the cheaper and more flexible route than using IP cameras which seem to always carry a premium because they require the additional networking electronics.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera is good, but the Mac software is bad", "Author": "TT", "ReviewID": "R22HHDPLFJC365", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Instead of reviewing the installation of the camera, I'm going to review its ability to work with Mac systems.  As you can imagine, this camera is better supported under Windows that other operating systems.  If there's any support for Linux, I can't find it.Mac OS X versions 10.6 and higher are supported.  I have 10.6.8.  I couldn't find the install CD for some reason, so I just went to the qsee.com web site to download the latest version.  Frankly, this is what everone should be doing normally, anyway.There are two versions of the software.  The first, called PSS, is the full version for OS X 10.6 and 10.7 only.  Alternatively, you can use the \"mini\" version.  The mini version is required for OS X 10.8.  One problem with the full version is that it's actually an X Window app in disguise.  As such, you also need to install XQuartz.  The odd thing is that Mac OS X already comes with an X Window library, called X11.app.  XQuartz is actually the same thing as X11.app, so you shouldn't need to install XQuartz if you already have the default X Windows support.  However, I could not get PSS to start with just the default X11.app.  I had to install the XQuartz software, so now I have two different versions of X11 on my system.The mini version does not require X11, but it does have some limitations.  The QSee web site said that these limitations should be fixed in an update that should have been available by now.  There's no sign of it, however.The software is really bad.  The fonts are barely legible, which is ridiculous problem to have.  Because the full verison uses X11, it obviously is just a Unix application recompiled for the Mac, but the user interface is bad no matter what operating system you're using.  The mini version is a native Mac application, but it also has a bad interface.  What's odd is that since it's really an X Window application, then where is the Linux version?The video stream has two problems.  First, while receiving video, both of my CPU cores are pegged at 100% utilitization.  This is stupid.  Second, the camera uses 1MB/second of bandwidth, regardless as to whether the video quality is \"high\" or \"low\".  What that means is that the camera always stream high-quality video, but it's the software that downgrades it.  This is dumb, because the whole point behind lowering the video quality is to lower the network usage.Another problem with the software is that it could not find my camera on the network.  I had to look up the IP address in my router's DHCP list, and then type in that address into the PSS software.This camera is not a pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) camera.  You cannot remotely aim the camera or zoom in/out.  You have to disassemble the dome with a small allen wrench and manually tilt the camera lens.  This is also how you access the SD card slot.  You cannot pan the camera at all -- you have to choose the direction when you install the camera.  So choose wisely.", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Why can't it be wireless", "Author": "Mark Taylor \"markdtaylor\"", "ReviewID": "R1VVSFHZ709BI7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was very excite to receive this camera as we have had kids tagging our neighbors fence.
