I use IP Cam viewer on android and the RTSP stream above, I think the stream is too large and the picture greys out alot. until i find a way to get the h264 stream I think it will continue to look this way. from time to time i can see the picture clearly, about every 3 to 5 seconds.On a wired computer the rtsp stream is in real time and clear", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00HM41ULU"}}
