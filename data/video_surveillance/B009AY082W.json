Setup was pretty simple and it works well with my email account, it's a decent camera with a decent web interface that does what it's supposed to do and works reliably, supports modern features and multiple users can be configured with different access levels.The pen and tilt moves almost silently, and are quick and precise. The LEDs on the rear panels can be disabled to be less conspicuous, in a nice touch.I really love these cameras so far. They are good budget priced cameras and other cameras with an image that's no better and software that's much worse are priced much higher. It's a great balance of modern features and decent quality.", "Date": "October 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "It works great and easy for setup", "Author": "gosh p.", "ReviewID": "R6GT2QQTJWOZ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This IP camera works just as hoped it would. It took just a few minutes to get it running and connected to my wireless network. Once that was done, controlling the camera from my laptop, phone, and tablet was very easy. I can move the camera to different locations in my house, and within seconds of plugging it in, it is back on my wireless network and visible from my computer and other devices.I have used this mostly for monitoring my 2-year-old daughter, who just transitioned from a crib to a toddler bed. We initially wanted to keep an eye on her due to her newly discovered ability to get out of bed. That is no longer a problem, but we still keep the camera in her room for piece of mind.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "awesome for the money", "Author": "Freedom", "ReviewID": "R3831XM5RNMRJG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this camera for an experiment, for the money and features it had to offer it seemed like a no brainer, after comparing it to similarcameras in its price range and reading several reviews it has proven to be a wise choice, the camera is very easy to set up, and provides a veryclear picture, the user interface leaves a little to be desired, and the audio will not work for some reason, but audio is illegal to use in securitysurveilance in many states anyhow, dollar for dollar , I would recomend this camera , it moves very smooth and almost silently, would be nice if theyimprove the interface so that you can choose limits on auto scan movement, but I have yet to find a low end IP camera that does,  and zoom again wouldbe a valued upgrade to it's performance, but is only available in more expensive cameras as well,  try one, you should be pleased with it's performanceand appearance,", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "The camera has a very wide field of view.

So this was easily mounted, no experience needed, and offered fast set up.This tilts up and down and the image is crystal.  I set it up to use on my iPad from a front window that's actually above my cabinets.  I can view who drives up, it works in real time and offers motion detection.My concern was how it would 'read\" at night or in low light but it has night vision capabilities and we got some great images.  I tried this both with Safari and with Firefox on my desktop, phone, iPad...all worked well for me.I have not tried this in the office as I got it for personal use; It would work equally as well above a register or to keep an eye on things as it is compact and the images are as clear as a more expensive model I got years ago.Camera provided by Polaroid; the review is my honest and unbiased opinion", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "A tremendous advantage to the safety of your home or office", "Author": "Grady Harp", "ReviewID": "REQK94N5JG6OE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The many features of this surveillance camera made by Polaroid make the price of the object seem impossibly low! This is an easy to install and very easy to access if you have Wi-Fi available and acts not only as a protective device for your place of installation but the messages it transmits can be picked up and monitored from a distance with the aid of a computer, laptop, iPad, iPhone or other android devices.The design of the camera device is compact and goes unnoticed as it scans 270 degrees with real-time audio and video streaming recording and still image capture. When daylight turns dark it automatically switches modes. The connectivity between the camera and your PC or mobile unit is secure. The motion detection is adjustable in order to send a signal to whatever device you have it programmed \u2013 meaning that while away form your home or office, you will be alerted to suspicious activity. You can adjust the sensitivity settings to be compatible to your workplace.For security at home or while way, this smart and well-designed device is top of the line.

The web server on the camera repeatedly prompts for a userid for any operation, but will not accept the default userid provided in the instructions - unless it is typed in three times in a row. It looks like you can provide any old userid three times in a row and it will let you in to the site. Clicking on any page within the site prompts for userid once again. Looks like you can also hit \"cancel\" when prompted for a userid and still get in! Once in though, I couldn't get a video feed with either VLC on IE or Google Chrome or the Server Push Mode. That makes this thing pretty much useless to me. I'm sending it back.Update: I skipped using IE and went to a Chrome browser, using the userid \"admin\" rather than the specified \"Admin\".

Btw, the manual reads like a 5 year old wrote them, spelling errors in every paragraph which really makes you feel confident about the product. This will be going back.*Update. Just got of the phone with their tech support. After 45 minutes of waiting, they realized that they haven't tested the product on the TWO most recent Mac OS systems...thus they have no idea if it actually works on Macs.
