using Wirecast and Ustream Producer. The only way you could possibly use this with Wirecast and expect good A/V sync is when using only these cameras and running the audio into the cam via it's mic jack thus making the A/V sync stream run simultaneously. Don't get me wrong the camera is great! The P/T/Z is amazing and if you don't mind the delay, which JVC says is about 1-5 sec (3sec with direct for me) then it makes a perfect monitoring cam. Wish I could use it but for Wirecast and Ustream Producer there is no way! Retailers should be mentioning this in their specifications to avoid lots of returns. I was your Guinea Pig.

Moran", "ReviewID": "R1O4QIW8XV2EJC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my difficulties with this camera, mainly because I use a Mac because I hate Windows. I thought JVC was Mac user friendly but not with this camera setup. I can access the camera with Safari but still can't manage files because I'm having trouble making an ethernet connection running Parallels. Maybe tomorrow after my Windows Guy appointment. The reason I bought this was not for streaming, it was the ability to control by wifi and record up to four cameras on SD cards from my ipad in 1920X1080p 30fps. Then, take that footage into Premiere Pro, sync the clips and edit using multicam. Four cameras, four tripods, a field recorder and an ipad and if I wanted a  hand held unit, or additional static units, I could do that too and still put cymbals on my knees. Add up the cost to do that wired. Plus, the camera operator(s) is not part of the show, or the wedding or whatever. Also, take along a wireless router and a power source or sources and you can almost set up anywhere and be ready without the cumbersome reconnection process to join all cameras to a new network.

For anything else, it is terrible.It is advertised as a \"live streaming camera,\" but contains no software to do any such thing.  Instead they ask you to use \"ustream.tv\" to stream the video, which runs in a flash app on the website while you get to watch ads.The only problem with ustream.tv and this camera is that it doesn't work.  On IE8, IE9, and IE10 it cannot even detect the video camera driver at all.  On Chrome, it doesn't work at all.  On Firefox, surprisingly, it worked fine for video.  Unfortunately, it never was able to detect the audio driver.If you only want to stream video (no audio) and you are willing to use Firefox, you might be able to take advantage of this camera.  Otherwise, it is a joke.  Oh, and Ustream producer, which they recommend, does not work with the camera at all.By the way, when I first installed the software, it told me there was an update an redirected me to this page: [...] , which is entirely in Japanese.
