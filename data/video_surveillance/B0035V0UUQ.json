I relied on them (the ratings) and I admit I did not closely read the \"Product Description\" before I made my purchase, but come on! My expectations were not that high considering the price, but this thing is pure junk. The video is fine as long as the cameras and receiver are right next to each other. Any more than a few feet apart (as in three feet), even indoors, the video is so bad that it's useless. Signal interference?? I have no nearby neighbors, and turning off every other wireless device in my home made no difference. Claims of \"interference\" is their cover for an inferior product. As they say in their own description: \"If you need a clear and stable image, do not purchase the wireless video camera\". I agree. If you want to completely waste your money on a useless unusable product, by all means buy this one. I give it -5 stars.

These go for about 65' then it fades pretty fast, REMEMBER a 9Volt battery will only run one of these for about 15 minutes \"at best\" so you need the external DC power that's included, ALL IN ALL I'm very happy with what I've got, they'll work just fine for my purposes.

There is little interface if they cameras are close to the receiver and much more interface when the cameras are far away from the receiver. I would only recommend buying these if you plan to set up the cameras close (10 feet) to the receiver or little blockage between the cameras and the receiver. If you need constant perfect image then I would recommend something else.Two more things I must add:1) When the 2 cameras are installed, you only get 1 camera's image at a time, but they switch back and forth. If you order more cameras, it will be 1 image at time, round-robin style.2) The power cords on these are short (~3 feet). I wanted to install them on the outside of my house, but can't seem to find the right power extender cable online.
