{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing Undetectable hidden security camera with wonderful fidelity", "Author": "C. Anderson \"Boot and Hair Crazy\"", "ReviewID": "R36WO2MW4TYE38", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought these on a whim as the security company I had installing my home security system had no motion detector cameras that looked remotely real and they were nearly $200 each and I needed three. I was nervous that the image would be poor and that they would be poorly made. I was pleasantly surprised and the installation technicians loved using these. The picture quality exceeds some of my Swann cameras in both complete darkness and during the day. At night and in low light the top part of the motion detector does emit a soft red glow but the motion detectors I had in place had a red light that came on and off. I would definitely recommend these items if you want unobtrusive inside monitoring cameras and don't need motion detectors where you place these. I would buy again. A great product at a very reasonable price.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Okay - but not very good performance!", "Author": "DFW Data Services (Corey Bryant)", "ReviewID": "R2231FFHMDXB9V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm not very happy with the performance on this model.  The picture is kind of blury (hard to make out faces at 10ft or beyond), and it seems to skip frames really badly, even after adjusting the DVR framerates.  Even on the master stream, it's choppy - which is very annoying.  Someone can walk by at a brisk walk and you might only see their back for a couple of frames.  Upon taking it apart, it was missing screws that attach the camera board to the body of the MD, and the other screws were loose.  Poor workmanship.  The IR feature does do pretty decent at night, though the blury picture immediately cancels that out.We have 7 other hidden cameras inside of faux motion detectors and we get much better results with those, which sell under model number HIPIR60 here on Amazon.  The HIPIR60 model does NOT have Infrared Lighting!  It does, however have a nice sized fogged window that you can mount any aftermarket IR unit in, or you can mount an external IR unit next to it.  The picture on this model is super!  It's a 620TVL Sony Super HAD CCD II which is a much newer cam than the GW brand.  I realize it's a bit of work to mount the IR unit inside of these, but being an IT guy at the office - that is the kind of stuff I enjoy doing.", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "OK", "Author": "R.

When it's a bit dark you can see a slight red glow on the unit from the infra red light.The image quality is not as good as I hoped.  It's possible there is not much difference between the 600 TVL and lower TVL versions of this unit.The mounting and construction is adequate, but not robust.", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "good camera for the money", "Author": "Gee Dee", "ReviewID": "R1KW6WHLGOZYV0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The installation was easy. I put this up in the corner of a common use kitchen. If you use conduit it has to be 3/4's. I bought half inch and the bnc connector barely fit through. I managed to get it through but the display on the camera screen was bad. The wires cannot be pinched at all. I used 3/4 conduit and worked perfect. The angle from the top corner covered the entire kitchen. The night vision worked ok as well. This is not a $200 camera. For the price paid is well worth it. I can highly recommend this camera for the price paid.", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great little camera.", "Author": "Anthony A", "ReviewID": "R3FMWRG5WWFP49", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Same size as your average motion sensor.
