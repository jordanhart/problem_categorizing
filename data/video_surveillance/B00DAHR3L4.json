{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Kills your home WiFi", "Author": "PatrickD", "ReviewID": "R22KKEXI6FRA1R", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This system runs on 2.4 GHz band for it's wireless camera connectivity, and it can not be set to a specific channel frequency (unlike most WiFi routers), as it is built to change automatically, for security purposes. If you have devices that rely on this same frequency (most non-N wireless networks, cordless phones, cell phones/tablets, laptops, etc.) save yourself the headache.The security system will still work perfectly, but your local network will be dead from the conflict in wireless traffic from the security system.It's too bad, because it is really a nice system and all the features I wanted, and at a competitive price.If you have an all 802.11n (5.x GHz) network, you will have no problems with having this system together with your network, and would consider this package to be one of the best.I'm going to return this, and get a different model that is wired. I was avoiding the wired model to save on installation and cabling, but the 5-6 hours I spent troubleshooting and trying to get all the wireless networks to play well, I could have fully installed a hardwire system.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DAHR3L4"}}
