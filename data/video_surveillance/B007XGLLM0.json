If you just want a basic, easy to install CCTV system this is great. Its as easy as mount the cameras with 3 screws, plug the cameras into the cables, run the wires to the unit and plug them in. Its easier than the average surround sound system.the night vision is OK, works well in darkness up to about 10 feet; the images are black & white though. The overall image quality is OK, if someone is within about 15 feet the image is clear enough to recognize a stranger by the photo.  Past 30 feet you'd have a hard time distingushing between Jessica Simpson and Hillary Clinton. When you attempt to 'zoom' the image it gets very grainy, so forget that idea. The field of view is fairly narrow, so if you are using it in a small space (10x10 room) the view is limited.Overall, its a breeze to put in and use, just dont expect the best image quality. if youre a small business or a homeowner, its fine though.UPDATE 2/13: here we are less then 18 months later and the system is not working properly. First, one camera developed issues with the image and rolling lines. Then a second camera did the same thing. Now the images freeze on the screen every few minutes for 30-45 seconds and it stops recording while this happens. I tried to contact Zmoto with no luck. For being less then 18 months old and only used inside a climate controlled store, I am disappointed.

I've seen a lot of bad reviews for Zmodo DVR's on other websites from people that don't know anything about CCTV IR based camera systems...I own 2 of these DVR systems, in my experience they are the best.  For years I struggled with PCI based DVR solutions, (SAMS club specials to) they ALL SUCK.  The software for all PCI based cards is the same Chinese garbage. No support, no updates, short operational life.Out of the box the Zmodo systems work very well and without hassle.  Couple of points to this...#1 Camera quality, for the price you can't expect the best.  The most important feature here is the DVR and these are worth the price (- cameras).  These don't have much range, they are too small you really need to tailor cameras to your environment.  Buy a larger one for distance visibility at night.  Do your research.  You can't expect these to see a license plate 15\" away.#2 To improve image quality use coax and not the dual cables provided.  Lot of quality loss in these but it isn't practical for companies to sell these with large coax bundles shipping would eat you.Only complaint I have is the manual is bad engrish.Regarding the actual DVR, it's fairly easy to use, the interface isn't the best but it is better than other systems.  The IE software is like all IE software, its buggy.  This one isn't compatible with mac but you can use vMEye on your iPhone to view it remotely.  There are other options for Mac, I don't ding the DVR for bad third party integration.  DVR should be standalone and work on its own anyway.  The newer model is mac compatible.  As for upgrades, there are non, but its pretty rock solid as is.  Would be nice to be able to shell into it to play with the linux build on it.  Again I wouldn't ding this product for the lack of upgrades when you compare it to the rest of the low end DVR market.Lastly support.  I had some issues with the last one I ordered missing parts and having a mixing issue (maybe woot issue).  The support was very surprising.  I hadn't needed it before.  Make sure you call the US support, don't email or use web chat it goes to China.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "For the price paid.....THIS UNIT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!", "Author": "JosephN", "ReviewID": "R2S9JX71G9P5EQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This system packs a massive load of value for the price paid. If you're looking for a basic camera system with decent camera images, then this is what you're looking for. By no means is it a commercial level feature packed system that can produce \"High Definition Images\". It cannot see fine detail, but produces usable images to see mischef around your property or business. For example, if you want to know which neighbor is messing with your car or who's dog took a crap on your lawn, you can probably identify someone you've seen before. The closer you can get a subject to these cameras the more detail you can see.INITIAL IMPRESSIONS:The DVR looked exactly as I intended. It was a good size and included a Western Digital 500GB Green Drive with a very recent manufacturing date. The cameras were smaller than I thought. No problem with that. All metal construction. Looked perfect for my installation. Everything was packed well in China!!INSTALLATION:I had already wired up my house with Siamese RG59/power cabling. I used no crimp BNC connectors and cut off the power plugs that were on the supplied bundles of camera cables. I spliced the plugs to the power cabling at the camera end and DVR. (Note: I used crimp caps with a little corrosion compound for the connections outside) If you're going to do this make sure you dont damage the conductors while stripping. Use the proper strippers and crimpers!!  The supplied power wire is very delicate (looked like 30awg wire). I mounted the cameras on the underside of my roof soffits. I won't get into much detail on that. Every application is different. I can say the supplied brackets worked out well. I had to mess with the cheap ball socket to get the camera to hold the position I wanted.  I'll try to post a picture of how I mounted them.POWER UP:I had everything connected including an old CRT monitor I had laying around. Everything worked and I was up and running with images on my screen. I adjusted all the cameras. A lot of back and forth, up and down. I got a workout. I started clicking around the menus. I've never used any other CCTV DVR before but I found no problems figuring out the menus. The included instructions were not that great. I just used them for reference. If you struggle with any type of menu system, you're probably have difficulty. I use all different types of menu structures for the type of work I do so I didn't have any trouble. I found it very intuitive.NETWORK SETUP:I am not a network setup expert. If you know nothing about networks, have someone else set it up for you. The instructions are not very good for someone who doesn't know what an IP address is. Once I figured out what IP address my router gave to the DVR I was up and running on another networked PC in my home. It did take a little tweaking of the settings within Internet Explorer to get it to work. Make sure it prompts you for unsigned Active X. The Zmodo website has information on this. There are also videos on youtube on this subject. For some reason, it only works on IE. I can't get access on Firefox, Opera, or any wireless device in my home. I need to consult with someone else on that. My router also opened up the ports I needed automatically because it had that feature. There is a setting in the DVR that you need to enable for that to work. I did get remote access on my Android phone with the IP Cam app. You need to know what INTERNET IP address you are by going to whatismyip or log into your router. Because I don't have a static IP, I need to use the DNS Service suggested in the information supplied. I won't go into this. It's too complicated and like I said, I'm not an expert. I can figure it out but can't explain it very well. I know it will work once I get it all set up.OTHER COMMENTS:I setup basic stuff like time/date, recording, motion, without issue. It may take a little messing with different settings to figure out how it all works. I'm very happy with the features of this DVR. I like how you can search for specific camera recording with motion marks. This way you don't need to watch hours of video. You can go right to where it saw motion. You can fast forward or manually go back. I've read other reviews of comparable DVR's in which you can't do that. A definite plus!! I'm still discovering other features the more I mess with it. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase. Amazon currently has the best price. It was delivered without issue as usual.***If you're not interested in remote access or home network access, this system will still work great. You can view everything from a monitor connected to the DVR and use the included laser mouse. You'll be up and running and love it!!I hope this in depth review helps others decide what system to buy.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Be warned - remote feature is very hard to set up!", "Author": "Adriana", "ReviewID": "RBPDWNE6HYOYV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you are looking for a basic surveillance system, this one will do just fine. The picture is OK, not crystal clear but good enough. I love the motion detection, night vision, and snap shots via email that you can set to receive in 1-10 min intervals. As to the installation ... If you have no IT background, you can probably still get through the basic installation fine. However, if you are going to try to set up the remote viewing feature, be warned that the instructions are not clear, and the pictures included with the instructions are not readable at all. Yes, you can call the tech support, but prepare for a LONG hold (and only during business hours - no weekends, no evenings). I was on hold for 67 minutes and spent another 1.5 hrs on the phone with the tech who helped me with the remote and iPhone set up. I thought to myself: this is a person who does it for a living, and it took him 1.5 hrs to set it up, how is someone like me without any IT background supposed to do that? The tech I spoke to admitted that the instructions are written very poorly and impossible to understand for a layperson. The set up still has some glitches even after the tech call, so I need to call again and go through another waste of a couple hours, but at least all the basics are installed now. So, if you have IT knowledge (or know someone who does) or a lot of patience and time, you should be ok. Otherwise, this will likely be a very frustrating experience.", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beats anything at Sam's or Costco. Great Value!", "Author": "Charles B. Firth \"Chuck\"", "ReviewID": "R2WJY3TUXIN2YH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have looked at the 4 channel security systems at Sam's club for years. For $219.27 with free Prime shipping and no sales tax, this just cannot be beat. I should add that I did not receive the DVR in the listing, PKD-DK4216. Instead they sent me what must be a newer model, the H9114V. It is much cooler looking and does not have any front panel controls, just a clean shiny black panel. The features are accessed using the remote or using the included optical mouse, both work great. Very sleek looking. Note: It is smaller than the photo makes it look as well, not VCR sized as expected, but only about 11\" wide and 1 12\" tall.This thing has a 500 gig Western Digital hard drive pre-instaled in it. That used to be an $80 value on its own. All I had to do was connect cameras and plug it into power and a VGA monitor to make it work. I also changed the default password. All cameras work great, not HD, but I think the images are very good. (I was used to a cheap wireless camera system I had before which was very grainy.) My property is pitch black at night, so the night view is fairly limited with just a spot on the ground and some tree branches visible. A person would have to walk right up to the camera and look at it to be seen with any detail. But if we had street lights or security lights I am sure it would be much better. Daylight is great.So, I connected the cameras, mouse, monitor, power and turned it on and up popped four images. Nice. Then I took it all apart and started routing the cables. A half inch or smaller boring bit is all you need if you are going through walls like I did, since you can fish the power and video connectors through the hole individually.The cables are way longer than I needed since I was just putting this in a 20x20 outbuilding. Lots of extra cable.So I got it all installed and then I hooked up the Ethernet cable... Ahhhh... sweet. Note: I am configured through a Ethernet switch (actually a wireless access point which also has wired ports) which connects to my wired router (Netgear dual with wireless turned off). You do not need to be connected directly to a router port, you can go through a switch. I tried looking at the manual to do the configuration and got bored with that and just found myself going out to Google. That is how I found the Zmodo knowledge-base. [...]I was able to find out everything I needed at the above web site. I was able to get all the correct network settings installed by starting with this page: [...] That told me how to get the default settings via DHCP. Later you need to change this to Static as per the instructions (adding 20 to the last two IP digits, in my case 25 + 20 = 45). Be sure to read all the sublinks about setting up IE with the correct Activex settings, setting up port forwarding in your router (they even had screen shots of all the most popular router setup software, including my own) and use the port checker link to check the port settings and get the external address as well, Port checker here: [...] Remote settings: [...]Then I found another page for the iPhone: [...]Note: I am NOT a network expert. In fact, I am pretty illiterate about network stuff. I just searched and followed directions. I am however very computer literate (used to the jargon) and that helped me fill in some blanks which might have confused, say, my wife.Now I can remote view all four cameras from either my PC via IE or on my iPhone. The iPhone app Zviewer is awesome. It even works over ATT 4G. I am leaving on a vacation next week and it will be very cool to pull out my phone and see four realtime views of my property from 1000 miles away -- and without dealing with messy web cam stuff and Windows/PC software. And don't forget... this thing is recording the video as well. You can rewind and see what has happened in the past as well. it's stand alone. In fact, the unit comes with a computer CD and I have no idea what it is for. I think it is for backing up settings or something to your PC via the unit's USB port.I can't wait to dig into some of the more esoteric features of the DVR setup software -- maybe get a motorized camera, mess with the motion detection...there is a lot of stuff in this thing.

After doing research for a couple of hours and reading reviews, I thought this would be a good product to go with.When I had first opened this product, I was skeptical because some pieces had been missing. For example you are not given a VGA cable even though it requires VGA output to display the channels. There are no screws provided to mount the camera's while they decided to give you the plates to attach the cameras to. Furthermore upon hooking up the camera I had noticed that one was not functioning. This was already a bad start as not only did the company who made this decide to be cheap and not give you the VGA cable, but one of the 4 cameras was already faulty. Needless to say I decided to keep on setting up giving the product a chance.I am disappointing to say that the night vision on the camera is horrible as you cannot see a single thing in the dark. The field of vision is extremely limited and small meaning that if you are expecting to see the front of your residence it will require all four cameras positioned very far back. Let's just say you won't be able to even recognize who is walking around if they decide to vandalize something. Not only that but the camera's would turn on and off by itself from time to time when recording. I found this out when I was reviewing the video log.The menu's for the device are really slow and the playback settings are even worse because the fastest setting you can set for the playback is 16x. This entails to fast forwarding half a minute a second which means if you are attempting to review 1-3 hour videos you will be there for a very long time. Honestly browsing the menus are extremely frustrating because it feels like running today's applications on a Pentium 1.When it came time to put this product to good use it failed me as my car was vandalized a second time two weeks later. At the most crucial moment when I needed the surveillance most, the camera's turned on and off throughout the night. There is no way that they were disconnected as they were hidden on the roof of the home. The night vision didn't help because it doesn't actually work (You can't see anything let alone recognize anything).Needless to say, save your hard earned money and find a different surveillance product.Had this product actually worked, I would have been able to catch the culprit who vandalized my vehicle but unfortunately not only did it fail but it costed me dearly.I will never buy from Zmodo ever again and would suggest everyone who reads this to stay away.Very disappointed!!", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sorry company to deal with", "Author": "ErnestJ", "ReviewID": "R1CIBSJ8SA6KPM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought the this Zmodo system several weeks ago.

I contacted them and told them I wanted the cameras that was to be included with the system since they had a higher resolution.

Overall, I am very happy with the purchase, especially considering the price.  The cameras work great in color or black & white night vision.  The resolution is fine to recognize someone within 20 feet or so.  It would be hard to recognize the face from farther away, but for this price camera system you can't expect that.  As other reviewers suggest, you could just buy a higher resolution camera for 1 or more channels if needed.  Also as others noted, the camera mounts are cheaply made and the weakest link.  However, I got them all to work by loosening them and then quickly tightening them after I had them aimed correctly.  It looks like they use a standard screw base, so you could just purchase better mounts somewhere.The software that comes with the DVR is much more powerful and with more options than I suspected from reading the other reviews.  The interface is a bit clunky to navigate and the documentation is very poor, but I was able to figure it out fairly easily just by going through the various software menus. One nice feature is that you can point and click on a transparent, square block interface which is overlaid on the image projected by each camera.  By selecting individual squares you can mask out portions on a camera's field of view that you don't want the system to detect motion in.  This was very helpful for a camera in our kids room, where we wanted the motion detection triggered if anyone enters or leaves the room, but not if the kids move around in their beds. I just masked out the field of view covering the beds.I recommend this system to anyone looking for a cost effective, basic system with lots of features.", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Save your money for a better system.

I expected it to have minimal options, low resolution etc.  I read a few other negative reviews, but figured I would take my chances.It was not terribly easy to setup, but it was possible.  I was not pleased with the cameras.  They do not run the cable through the base, but you have to mount the camera to your house, and drill a separate hole to run the cables.  Somebody can literally walk up behind your camera and unplug it.  The screws were also really cheap and strip out very easily.  As for networking, I have basic IT knowledge.  I had a relative help with the mobile surveillance setup (this is the most difficult part).  After setup though, I do expect a product to work properly.  This system FAILED miserably!  The grass is reddish/pink, the reds are green, the colors are all messed up!  I plugged in another camera from a different manufacturer, to find that the colors were true, and it was the cameras themselves rather than the DV-R unit.  Even adjusting the color settings just made other colors off, even when I was able to make the grass appear as green.  I was also having trouble with the remote monitoring.  So that's when tech support came in...  It took me less than 5 minutes to get through to someone, and they spoke great English!According to their rep, the color problem on the cameras is a \"known problem with no solution\".  He explained they are cheap cameras, and I would need to upgrade them in order to correct thisissue.  He also had me download another app (KMeye) in the android market for remote viewing(using HTC Evo 4g).. This did not correct the problem.  Seems that only channel 1 will update on the mobile app.  So knowing now that this is such a low quality product, I am thankful Amazon has a great return policy.  I'm only out a little for shipping.  I payed the extra cash, and went with the Costco system for 299.  Well worth the extra money.  8 channels, better interface, and much better cameras!

PATTERSON", "ReviewID": "R1WMAPV7WX3T62", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After reading the good and the bad reviews on this, I bit the bullet and ordered one for our community clubhouse.  I've had experience with a couple of \"$700+ DVR\" analog systems and the medium spectrum, but not this low end realm.Unboxing - The shipping box arrived in good shape from Amazon.  The inside product box was sealed.  However, the DVR was not well protected inside its box.  There wasn't any protective wrap on it and it was free to bounce around a couple of inches.  There was one missing screw on the back of the cover.  My guess is that it was taken out to have the hard drive installed at a second location.  It was sloppy packaging.  There was also a remote control and CD/literature/power supply under the cardboard platform.  These were fine.The cameras, cables and camera power adapter were in a 2nd box within the product box.  They were OK.Cameras - They are small, almost palm sized.  The mounts are very weak, but do the job.  They can be easily ripped off a wall or tampered with, so mount them where they are hard to get.  All that said, the images are very good.  Not terribly wide angle, so keep that in mind,  The IRs (infrared emitters) work, but don't have much dispersion.  They cameras work very well in medium to low light, before the IRs turn on.  The colors on these were accurate.Cables - 60 feet each.  They are low end, but work.  Be wary of placing them near other electrical wires/devices as they can pick up interference.DVR - Overall good.  The recording quality (set at high) is on par with much more expensive units.  The interface is a bit clunky for my tastes, but does the job - read the manual, you'll need it.  Some things (like the motion detection grid) work opposite the way you'd think it would.  Where you set the blue blocking squares is where it records.  It's counter-intuitive to me and opposite of most higher end systems.  You have some control over image brightness and color, but this one works fine as-is.  The motion detection is decent, but I had to choose low sensitivity on the outdoor cameras.  The H.264 compression is good with small file sizes.  File exporting to thumb drive works, but be sure to have their player software installed on the PC you play it on,  I'm not sure why their version of H.264 is different from everything else.  Still, it works.  I'll try their export to AVI later.  I'm sure it's a weird codec, too.  I have yet to have an internet connection at the clubhouse, so I can't speak to that - yet.Summary - Would I buy this again?  Yes.  For under $200 with installed HD, it's a great little unit.  It's probably not a long-distance runner, but who knows.  If you are smart about placing your cameras, it should work just fine.  If you place them high and 20 feet away, you will be disappointed.  Keep them relatively low and near the area you're watching - if possible.  Analog SD video is what it is.  Even if the cameras get damaged or tampered with, they are cheapies.

I'm paid to figure things out and then find a simple way to explain them so other people can use them without really having to figure them out. I have no tech aversion whatsoever. I like a challenge. I'm not only comfortable setting up my home network, I've written User Guides for others to do so.Here's what you're getting: a $200 DVR with an operating system and 4 cameras.What that means:It's cheap. Everything's plastic. The components are likely bottom of the ladder garbage. The DVR and remote don't weigh .5LB combined.It's made in China.It's poorly documented. Like, Mad-Libs bad.The operating system/menu functions/on-screen navigation are vague and confusing.Want to manage this from your PC or view it on your iPhone/iPad? You better know what you're doing when it comes to your router configuration.Help and support is understaffed and sometimes conflicting information is scattered all over the place.My story:I took a chance on this. I hooked it up and configured. All was well for about 10 days (never did get the iPhone/iPad thing working, but I was going to revisit that when I had more time). Then, the DVR started beeping incessantly (which started in the middle of the night, as these things inevitably do). The cause was a hard disk error (uh oh). I rebooted. I power cycled. I tried reformatting the hard disk twice. No luck.I went to the Zmodo website and used the \"Call me\" link for Tech Support to call me when they were available. I was quoted a 95 minute response time. 285 minutes later, my phone rang. The agent suggested I tried reformatting. When I told him I'd done that twice, he had me pull the voltage specs from the power adapter. According to the agent, the power adapter that I have (the one that ships with the product) is insufficient to provide ample power to the DVR to allow it to complete the reformatting process. They're sending me a different power adaptor.Now I enter their RMA queue and we'll see where that goes.So, back to my original point. A high-quality, four camera system is going to run you $1200, minimum. This costs $200. From the materials, to the specs, to the usability, to the documentation, to the support - it's NOT high quality in any way.I'll post an update after I run the RMA gauntlet. This is what you get for $200. Maybe the power adaptor is all I need. I hope so.

It appears that by default the DVR will default to DHCP but you'll want to change it to a static IP in order to use the NAT.Apparently you can only use Internet Explorer on windows to view the DVR and you need to change the Active X security settings in order for it to install it's app. Follow these instructions [...]Here's a list of which ZMODO dvr's work with a mac[...]If you want Email alerts you will need to setup a SMTP server account.

The only downside to this was that it was text via a different number each time.  It would have been good if it was the same number so I could set a distinct tone for it.  My best advice, if you do not know anything in regards to IP setup and configuring a network, your best bet is to get someone who does.

Comes well packaged both inside and out. Cameras are individually packaged in foam sleeves and individually boxed. The receiver unit comes in its own box and is packaged in a liberal amount of bubble material. The remote control, instruction manual & I assume instructional mini-DVD are all in a bag with the receiver.The wires for the cameras are by no means top of the line but as long as you're careful, you'll be fine. I read a LOT of reviews about people having issues with stapling the wires to the walls, but I have 3 out of 4 cameras mounted and no issues with the staples. The camera bases aren't the best, they take some finagling to get right, but they work well enough that you shouldn't have to worry about the camera flopping around like a wet noodle.I purchased the advanced (24 IR LED) kit and I am impressed with the cameras ability to illuminate at night; no football stadium lighting here but good enough to cover my entire back patio and even can see the light on the ground from my 2nd floor mounted camera aimed at my cars. Image quality on screen is par, but playback quality is much less, people are discernable but don't expect this to be full HD like the movies. Night time image quality is what you should expect from a $200 camera system.The equipment is simple to install, easy to use, and while the manual has some broken english it is legible to anybody who understands english. So far I've only had one HDD error which was resolved by powering down the unit and powering back up. I've been constantly recording for 3 days now with zero issues.I highly recommend this product over the $600 Lorex system if you need something quick and simple. However, not having wireless cameras is a pain in the ass as I have had to tuck 60 feet of wiring under my baseboards and what not. Aside from that though, this system does everything I could want it to do. But if you live in anything bigger than an apartment, go ahead and buy longer cables for the cameras. My 800 sq ft townhouse is too big for one of the sets of wires to reach from upstairs to the receiver.Also the receiver pictured is not what I received. Mine is much sleeker with no buttons and only 2 red LEDs on the front indicating power and HDD recording. I would have to say that since some of the other reviews there has been a large number of improvements to this system. But if you're looking for high quality images and HD playback, go with a better system.

I don't know if this is a problem, or if I just can't figure out the setting, again, language barrier.  The other thing is that I'd like is to have more control from the iphone app, like being able to see the videos that've been recorded not just live.Compared to other products, I think it's a steal, I was surprised that the HDD was a Western Digital and not some off brand.

You will need to set everything out to make sure you have what you need in the way screwdrivers, drills and such.The cameras are good quality but not super distance cameras.  Paired with the DVR for the price you can't go wrong with the system.  You can swap out cameras if you want a higher res or more detailed oriented camera, just remember you are purchasing a lower priced system under $400.00 here.  These are good basic cameras.I suggest using Coax video cables to get a better image quality out of the system.  The included wiring is a bit on the cheap side and not really worth the time and effort needed for installation.  Make sure you reread the installation guide and look over the parts as you set up the system because it looks like a 3rd grade Chinese interpreter wrote the manual.  Poor grammar and all sorts of odd guideline sentences.  Had to reread many sections a few times to really understand the steps involved.Call US Support for issues.  I believe from other reviews the chat and email is sent to China which just exacerbates the issues you may have if they develop.  When you go to setup the DVR make sure you have a non Mac system for install, it's not Mac compatible but they have an app that you can use on your iphone for remote viewing.

Second the cameras really suck and are not as advertised. The night vision works only about 10' away so anything farther away is not viewable. The camera also has a small/narrow view angle roughly about 38 degrees. I really was expecting better cameras sine the technical specs indicate much higher specs than real word (see specs below).

If you have no IT background, you can probably still get through the basic installation fine.

Yes, you can call the tech support, but prepare for a LONG hold (and only during business hours - no weekends, no evenings).

I thought to myself: this is a person who does it for a living, and it took him 1.5 hrs to set it up, how is someone like me without any IT background supposed to do that? The tech I spoke to admitted that the instructions are written very poorly and impossible to understand for a layperson. The set up still has some glitches even after the tech call, so I need to call again and go through another waste of a couple hours, but at least all the basics are installed now.

It blew out the DVR and my security system was down.  I called a repair person and he quoted me $415.00 for a new 4 channel DVR and 1 dome camera.  I told him to hold off and I went on Amazon and checked for the least expensive system and found this one.  I own a small business and like most money is tight.  I paid around $195.00 delivered and it was here with standard shipping in about 3 days (that is awesome in itself).  Once the system came in I had a tech savvy friend drop by and he installed the new camera and the DVR in about 45 minutes.  It works perfectly and the resolution on the new cameras is better than the old system (3 years old) by far.  I was warned by the first technician that I called not to buy \"cheap\" stuff but I rolled the dice knowing that Amazon has always treated me good with their refund policies (there was a 30 day refund policy on this particular item).  In addition, I love the mouse that came with the system because I can zoom in on one camera with the click of the mouse or click again and see all four.

On the box they come it says 30 ft. But you can't even see 2 ft with them in complet darkness. So if youre getting these for the IR, move on to one that has more leds.The motion sensing is great. I have them set to low sensitivity and one that is like 40 ft from the street still goes on when a car goes by. I'm yet to hoop them up to the Internet because my modem is pretty far from where I've set them up , so that's another drawback, still trying to figure out a solution.", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "I am glad I got this", "Author": "tyrel", "ReviewID": "R1IYWMRXD6HGQK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "when I got it it was great now I can see what is happening around my house and see who is around and whats going on and it still works overall works great", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty good.", "Author": "Jean Genest", "ReviewID": "R2P3DDRVEK7F2G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought and installed this a couple weeks ago and have not had any problems.Everything was easy to set up and plug in.

While these are all valid factors, they didn't influence my rating and following review since I do not need the remote viewing feature nor will I need to link it to my network/router, etc -This review is for the folks (like me) that just want to be able to monitor/record interior/exterior areas of their house, business, etc with the ability to review the recorded footage at a later time should something get vandalized, stolen, etc. during the night, over the weekend, or for monitoring who's coming and going at the door, porch, mailbox -  You get the idea.I'm not an IT person, don't have an extensive background in computers or the surveillance industry - However, like most people I can use a PC, DVR, Smartphone and update my Facebook status without relying on help from a digital/tech savvy 10 year old -  so if that's you too, relax. -  Anyone that knows the difference between a pair of pliers and a crescent wrench will have no problems setting this up for basic monitoring/recording. It's like hanging up Christmas lights for me by now, as this is system #5 on a new property. After doing a temp set up using previous hardware already in place this is my take on this unit that will hopefully help out some folks and assist them in determining if it's right for their house and needs.This system is easy to set up, it delivers an okay and acceptable image and is ideal for the homeowner or small business owner. (again I'm referring to only the installation of the cameras & hooking up to your TV or computer monitor and recording/reviewing footage with the included DVR - NOT THE REMOTE ACCESS - WIFI - NETWORK/INTERNET Capabilities) -While this system is marketed as a indoor and OUTDOOR system,  it's definitely not designed with an emphasis on the outdoors, longevity wise, as the elements of even living in cookie cutter suburbia will reduce the lives of the cameras and wiring substantially from my experience with similar units. I've installed 4 surveillance systems on my home over the past 20 years and I was not that impressed with the quality of the wiring and the fact that the camera and power connectors aren't hardwired into the camera (you connect the camera to it's video and power cable at the mounting spot as opposed to just a single wire that is hardwired right into the camera and then powered by the monitor inside your home) - That is an automatic drawback.BNC and a power cable at the camera location? Exterior? Aside from the highly noticeable red and yellow plastic connectors that scream attention to themselves, this type of setup is a disaster in the elements - Within a few months rest assured that the sun, exposure to wind, rain and just the elements will have these frayed & destroyed - One could build a 'makeshift' box to protect the connectors, but that's more time and aggravation. I learned the hard way with an identical setup and know that this is a recipe for a camera failure a few months down the road - Even if you're mounting under eaves or in a place that isn't directly exposed to sun, wind, etc - You have to deal with securing and concealing the wiring. Depending on your house, it may or may not be that big of an issue - For this house, it is an issue since my eaves are not that high, and if one wanted they could just rip the camera and wiring off quite easily.IMAGE: Not bad. Okay and well within an acceptable quality range for the price. Night vision is fairly good - Remember, these aren't going to be able to read plates in pitch black night from 100 feet away - It does a good enough job at close range, but ambient light from a porch light, street light, etc improves it - In all fairness the image quality is good for what you're paying for. Don't have unrealistic expectations that it's going to capture crystal clear images from great distances - But it will catch a good image of a person in your driveway within 20 feet or so in near dark conditions.IMAGE SIZE - That left me unimpressed - I felt as if the cameras are all zoomed in - The best way to describe it: Imagine a mid 1990's camcorder on max zoom on a person or object from a considerable distance - Basically the aspect ratio is not wide enough for my needs - (older bullet IR cameras I am replacing had 3x the width) These are great for smaller/confined areas (like the porch, a door, gate) but forget a wide area - The image is good but too 'close' -Wiring/cables: Like others,  I did find them to be rather thin - Which wouldn't be an issue if I was using them indoors - These wires definitely wouldn't survive one summer without degrading under the hot sun. If you can install them where they won't be exposed to the sun for long periods you should be fine, but for anyone that needs to run them in areas where they will get a lot of exposure - I'd be leery -DVR: It's great and easy to configure - No problems with that - Remote and mouse all work as described - No issues there.PROS: Inexpensive and quick set up - For the money it is a good deal if it fits your needs - Basically something that you can install quickly and have up and running and won't loose sleep over if you can't take it with you if you move.CONS: BNC and Power connectors at the camera; BAD for exterior application - Makes it vulnerable to the elements, calls attention to itself and is one more thing you have to secure and (if needed) conceal.Mounts are standard cheap metal mounts that do the job - Screws are almost a bad joke - Plan on using decent ones if you want it to stay in place - The supplied screws are about as durable as scotch tape on a hot stove -In closing - After testing the cameras, DVR and reviewing footage from day/night recording I'm not all that impressed. I'm not unhappy, but I thought that the camera image quality was identical to something from 15 years ago - Not 2014. They're great for now, don't get me wrong, but I foresee them fizzling/dying out in 6-12 months.  Had I made the mistake of permanently mounting them, running the cable through eaves, attics and crawlspaces, well I'd keep it and make the best of them - But I'm relieved  I only did a temporary set up for testing and evaluation.I WOULD KEEP THEM and do a full permanent installation if the cameras were hardwired with video/power cable - The deal breaker is the ridiculous BNC and power cable plug at the mounting location that one must plug into the camera. Had these been hardwired, I'd be content to keep them - I can deal with everything else, pro/con but from experience, the BNC and power plug at the camera is a no go for me. Other than that, I see no other negatives worthy of noting - I just feel this is better suited for indoors with the way it's video and power line is set up - Thin wire + Connectors at the camera makes this a dud for my house.Now of course that's just my evaluation based upon the set up at my house - Do your homework and get an idea of where you will mount these and note how much wire will have to be ran and secured - They may be ideal or impractical - It all depends on your needs and where you install them.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "pretty good camera set up", "Author": "dolrgn7one", "ReviewID": "RGP1P5Y1FMK79", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The only draw back to this system was getting it set up to view over the internet...the directions were very weak..but once I got in contact with the company the people worked very well to get it working properly....make sure you call and get live assistance from the computer site.

Set-up DVR motion sensing recording with little effort. I only have two complaints:First, the video quality is not the greatest; so, from a distance, you might not be able to make out a face, but if you have a sensitive area, like a front door, and you cannot mount the camera close you can always upgrade that camera. The cameras included get very good face shots out to about fifteen-twenty feet in light (if you know the person maybe out to twenty five to thirty feet), at night I'd say five-ten feet (if you know the person I'd say maybe out to fifteen to twenty max).Second, the interface and configuration options while connected over your network do not come close to what you can do hooking a monitor and mouse up to the DVR directly. This sucks because if you hide your DVR, as you should for security purposes, you have to dig it out, unlock it, whatever, in order to hook a monitor and mouse up to it to do whatever administrative tasks you need to do. It is not the end of the world, but it would be much better if the network interface allowed complete control.I would buy another for a second house or business.Update: Back up the cameras with motion sensing lights for night time use. I had my Jeep broken into and my motorcycle stolen, which were both caught on camera at night in my driveway. The video was not clear enough to see faces in either case (the thief's face that broke into the Jeep was about ten feet from the camera and it was not clear enough to give 100% mugshot surety). You can see what is happening, what clothes people are wearing and even their ethnicity, but detail is not that good (i.e. you will not get a good mugshot at all).I would still buy this setup again -- but if I need very good clarity at night in a certain area I would add light or upgrade that camera. I am adding wireless, motion sensing lights to the system and now will be able to see everything at night. I also ordered motion sensing alerts to the driveway, so if someone goes into that area it will sound a signal to a portable, remote alarm.

So I went through the remote set up instructions with painstaking attention to detail. I got the ports on my router forwarded and confirmed they were open. I got the right IP address settings, set up the DDNS redirect and none of my mobile devices would connect to the thing. What finally worked is I deleted all of the usernames on the device and replaced them with lowercase options and simple 4-digit passcodes. Then I discovered that within the app settings on your mobile device you need to be connecting to the remote/mobile port (usually 7050) which I had either overlooked or was not documented.Finally, I got the thing working.

I used this camera system to find out who was vandalizing my property and then I purchased the Maxam Stungun with Light and Sheath (another great buy from Amazon) and I took care of biness or as white people say, \"business.\"  Let me tell my story.I had just gotten back from the Church's Chicken here in Birmingham.  I had gotten myself the grape drank with extra crispy fried chicken.  Seeing way too many brothers in the restaurant, I had decided to go back to the pad to eat that up.  Oh, I nearly forgot, I also ordered a biscuit.  Anyway, I come back home and like 5 minutes into my meal, I hear a knock at my door.  I open the door and not a soul was there.  I was just about to turn around and walk back inside, when I look down and see Jehovah Witness fliers all over the place.  It was like someone had just thrown them at the house and ran away.  I spent like a good 8.5 minutes cleaning that crap up.  And boy, I was pissed as hell.  The next day it happened again and it repeated for the next four weeks, occurring at different times.  I then ordered this surveillance system, and got the rush shipping.  At 4:36 PM on December 8, 2012, I got him on footage.  I watched him on the video play-back, he was just about as wide as he was tall, a fat little loser.  He had one of those 90's style headphones on, probably gay.  He had a container of French fries in his right pocket, casually grabbing a fistful and putting them in his mouth, including his hand.  Like, he literally put his entire hand in his mouth.  Then he had the pamphlets in his other pockets, he grabbed those and flung them at my door.  Then like the fat, gay, jolly SOB he is he went running down the street.  In total, I had set up 87 cameras on my street, so I could identify which house he lived in.  It turns out, he lives right next to me.  Like literally 8 steps from my front door.  Next day I went to his house and talked to his mama.  I had the video footage saved on my computer and the stungun in my pocket, you know just in case this mother-bitch started getting antsy.  She said that he is a disrespectful juvenile. So I decided to help out because we all gotta clean the streets up.  I called the police and told them that he is an animal abuser (I made it up, I had to find something to put this kid in jail).  Anyway, the po-po came and took care of it and his mother was so happy to get rid of her punk-ass son.  I am now happy to call her my fianc\u00e9, but I ain't ever going to consider this child my son.So, all-in-all, this product put a juvenile delinquent behind bars and got me a girl.  Get this product, you ain't gonna regret it.  My girl and I are scheduled to get married in June, but my mama said she will not come.  I spent all of her retirement money on this system, I think that's why she won't come and why she continues to leave voicemails on my iPhone that say, \"I have fallen and I can't get up,\" just to annoy the hell out of me.  I mean, she is lying, because in the history of America, nobody with a cane has ever fallen down.  I decided to buy an oven to test the temperature resistance of this item.  NOTE: It will melt at 786.2 degrees Farenheit.  If anyone needs melted scrap metal, I will give you a deal.I am satisfied.", "Date": "April 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "OK", "Author": "Charles", "ReviewID": "R6XH380ZDF6B1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "So I bought this system but with 8 cameras.

The hard drive is supposed to be only motion activated i can't get to just record from motion. also you can't go to a specific time when looking through you have to fast forwarded so long and bogus next time i will be looking for a much better one.

Instead I opted for a QSEE 720P camera system with 1 TB DVR. The cost was about 2.5x more but here is the advantages (and I am not advocating for QSEE over ZMODO). First off if you are going to spend the time running the wires and installing the cameras then spending more for better is a no brainer. The QSEE 720p cameras have a wider angle, super clear picture and excellent night vision. I found the ZMOMO system had very low quality made 60ft pnc cables while the QSEE system had 100ft quality POE ethernet cable (Power over ethernet) so still only a single line run to each camera. The Zmodo dvr interface was ancient comared to the QSEE dvr. The QSEE system I bought came with 4 720p cameras (which appear to be rebranded Dahua IPC-HFW2100 cameras which run $150 apiece). I paid $499 for the QSEE system and have had it running for about a month with no issues even in sub zero weather.Running the cable for any system will take a lot of time but 720p is such an upgrade over the tvl cameras its shouldn't even be a decision. I give this system 2 stars based on cost. Having cameras will deter people but having usable video at longer distances is not possible without better cameras. The plus about the POE systems is that if you want to upgrade the wiring is in place. You cant upgade to good cameras with the bnc wiring without replacing it.Bottom line is if its within your budget go with a 720p system or better (better being 1080p cameras). Doing the wiring for any system is a task. It took me two hours to run all the cable and set up two cameras outside (planning ahead is key). I bought a keystone wall plate and couplers to connect everything so the installation was clean (and the wiring is already there to connect the other cameras). My installation I would consider on the easier side just based on where I located the dvr and the run to the attic. Again the install is a one time task but will take time so make sure the system you buy will meet your expectations in the end.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "not what I expected", "Author": "Thomas W Moore", "ReviewID": "R1XFYFW66BNP6C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The instructions were hard to understand and so small they were hard to read I thought the system was wireless and it isn'tI guess it would be ok if you don't mind a bunch of wires coming into your house.", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "beware! not a complete kit", "Author": "spend too much here!", "ReviewID": "R6KPMLEW687UD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i ordered this kit and now am spending another 100 dollars to get a hard drive for the dvr. sure would have been nice to know the kit doesnt come complete. in my opinion that is a way to scam me out of more money. i believe i will be returning this set and going with a different brand. very disappointing.", "Date": "April 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Christmas gift", "Author": "Alice White", "ReviewID": "R2ZHIU495MZMI9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am not sure about the quality and dependability of this product yet.

The system itself performs as its supposed to: it will record and capture video and you can access it on the network to look at a live view.But consider this: this is a reactive approach to security. If someone steals your valuables and you have it recorded on video, what then? You can turn it into the police, but unless they have a crystal clear image of the individual(s) and that person is a known criminal in their system or you can identify them, then you are SOL. In other words, file an insurance claim and hope for the best, because the police can't do anything.Did you know that video surveillance isn't admissible in court as evidence unless it can be identified by a witness? That means you had to either be watching them steal your valuables on your phone while this was happening or someone at the location of the crime witnessed the act while the video was recording and can testify to the matter. This system will really offer you 0 value unless you intend to use it to monitor employee behavior. I would highly recommend investing in an alarm service or video monitoring service, or hiring a consultant to provide details on how to make your home or office more secure (such as adding lighting or building a fence).
