Can hear what is going on in area, easy to use with android phone, iPad and computer.Cons,I've sent an email to company for the firmware update, two weeks no reply.( that changed to very rapid responses)The instruction manuals are generic to cover multiple products.I have not seen where you can put an sd card.( you must unscrew the front of the camera to get to it, still a con)If I can get the function to be able to talk both ways i would upgrade this to a five star.  I have two now in my home and the video is great.Third update.  The response time to emails has been incredible. Just a few hours for them to respond to emails.  Plus they showed what was needed to talk through the camera,with great illustrations.I  highly recommend getting this camera if you need a few cameras and want to actually see  what your looking at.  They are worth every penny.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "returned after hours of frustration", "Author": "Jerry D.

Unhook and mount (several times) could not get a picture. No on line help, don't answer e-mails, no phone number for tech help.  Will buy a cheaper system soon.  Glad Amazon does returns.", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00ELFI5B6"}}
