{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works great", "Author": "Jon", "ReviewID": "R1FG0I4U980QS5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace one of the swann cameras I have that came with a dvr package. I wanted one like this because it's white, small, and has a much wider angle. The wide angle was important to me. I mounted this on the roof of my front porch and I can see everything now. With the old camera I could only see about half. I already had the wires run and hole drilled for the camera, so switching out my old ones for this was simple. The plugs are standard bnc and normal power cable. The picture quality on these is better than the ones I had but not by much. I don't really blame the camera though since it's probably the DVR that's the bottle neck now. I'll be ordering more.Edit: I just got a second one in and installed it. No real difference in performance compared to the other one. Everything is ok with it. However I have noticed the night operation isn't the best. My first one is under an always lit porch and is good, the second on the driveway which is very dark at night. If it is pointing to a pitch black area, you get some of the IR/lens reflection going on and night vision is maybe 20 ft at best. This isn't a deal breaker for me but if you need night vision in general with a security camera system, look in to motion sensor lights or IR flood lights. For security, motion sensor lights would be good to have anyways. There are solar powered ones if you don't want to run wires.", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "24ir 700tvl dome", "Author": "donald treull", "ReviewID": "R1NV07QN6EFAN2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Not  all that good of a camera.

I had to order a separate power supply and when it finally arrived, I found that 1 of the cameras had defective IR LED's. Had to return. Other camera has nice color and good night time vision. The only drawback, and maybe this is normal for these types of cameras, is the camera makes a very audible click sound when switching from day to night mode and back. Could draw attention to it if in the right situation.", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GA7TX4Q"}}
