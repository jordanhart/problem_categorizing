Boy am I glad I did that!!! After 2 days, a new router, and 6 hours of reading all I could get to work was the local viewing on my LAN. 1st problem was that I have Verizon FIOS and the router they provide is trash. It would not let me forward my ports so I could gain access to the DVR from a remote internet connection. So I purchased a new ASUS router. After the new router was installed I was able to get connected on my mobile device, I phone 5, as well as on my local network. Still no remote internet connection. I searched Q-see.com and read everything I could find even searching Google. Nothing helped, I followed everything in could find to get a domain set up and still couldn't get remote access. Now to the 2nd problem, DVR set up instructions. What a disaster and how confusing. Once I called Q-see and talked with a wonderful technical support person, her name was Faith by the way, she had me up and running in minutes. Come to find out, everything sent with the system including the manuals are wrong. Even the software they send you to monitor the DVR has misleading information in it. All in all the system is wonderful. The customer support is wonderful, if you don't mind waiting to get through. But I must warn anyone looking to get this system on the internet to monitor remotely. Don't waste your time with the instructions, once you get the dvr and cameras plugged in, plug the network in and then call them. Hopefully you get someone as knowledgeable as Faith. The technical support will have you running in no time. Hope this helps anyone else from having the same issues I had.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Gary Ward", "ReviewID": "RFY6MYECOYA5H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I like the cameras and the ease of hooking them up .

I had to rewire system to work from rca cords to get screen to work long enough to get into system and reset screen setting to lower res to work on my monitor. Now one week into use the hard drive has froze 3 diff times in a week. keeps my screen locked onto old pictures until i reboot dvr. Amazon is sending a replacement but i would not buy this one again and if this new unit does the same i will be sending all of it back. It would not be fun to take down 8 camera's 1000 feet of wires and 2 days worth of work becouse of cheap china junk. No where in discription does it say comes with wires for camera so i ordered 8 150 foot cords only to have cords in the box Buyer beware of this unit. will keep fingers crossed that the new hard drive does not freeze up also.UPDATE: replacement unit arrived as i was only going to swith out hard drives as the one i bought freezes all the time. I hook up new hard drive only to have it in constant spin mode once its powered up it makes a loud spinning noise like a  bad hard drive in search mode.

They are remarkably similar, with a few key differences.Cameras:The cameras for both the Q-See and the Defender are virtually the same. They are shaped the same, are about the same size, and the plastic weather shield hood over each camera slides forwards and backwards on both brands. Their night time viewing distance looks to be virtually the same. You can mount one of these cameras to your garage and see people walking on sidewalks and driving by in the street in the middle of the night, no light needed. If you happen to have a porch light on, this extends the night time viewing distance even further, providing some light for the cameras to pick up on.Both brands of cameras have color video for the daytime, and grey scale black and white for night. The only difference I've seen with this between the two brands in the Defender cameras work very distinctly in either color or black and white. You can even see the cameras switch into black and white mode when the daylight gets too low. The Q-See on the other hand seems to work in both black and white and color, all at the same time. When testing out the lighting, I was able to get the cameras to focus on dark objects very close up in low light, and the camera started viewing it in the night vision gray scale, while other areas of the room that more more brightly lit, still showed in full color. It was a very interesting effect.While the colors and hues are adjustable on both brands of systems, I think the brightness that comes through on the Q-See system is a bit better. On a dark grey rainy day, the Q-See cameras seem to show everything as bright an sunny, giving you even more clarity. My Defender system tends to see the gloomy rainy days as being the same as dusk, and instead of brightening the view, they instead switch into the grey scale night vision mode.Cables:Both brands of security systems use the same types of cables. It's actually two cables that are seamed together into one, but then split into two again and each end. These cables provide the video signal and also the power to the cameras. So there's no need to run extension cables out to where your cameras are located. These cables provide all the power you need. They are shielded to protect against the weather, and work very well. If you are in need of especially long cables, there are spools of longer cable that can be bought separately. I've seen these cables come as long as 500 feet in length.Software:The software is the biggest difference when comparing the Q-See and the Defender systems. The program to run everything is installed right onto the DVR that comes with the systems. While I found the actual use of the software with the Defender systems a bit easier to navigate, the depth of settings and options with the Q-See software is more extensive. Defender software is more set-up-and-go, while Q-See software is more about picking just the right settings for your needs. I found it took more time to navigate and learn the Q-See software, but I was able to personalize more settings with it as well, over the Defender.Conclusion:The Defender and the Q-See systems both have their strengths. While I like the more user friendly software of the Defender brand systems, I like the brightness in low-light settings of the Q-See cameras a bit more. Both have great viewing during the day, and both do well when working in night vision. But the low light visibility with the Q-See (that time between day and night) is a bit better than with the Defender system. So either system you'll be happy with, since they both work extremely well. But if your looking for the simplest and most user friendly software, you might find the Defender software easier to learn. If you want to have the best video footage possible, for all lighting conditions, this Q-See system is a great choice.", "Date": "June 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Top 5 reasons why this system is an excellent choice", "Author": "Lincoln", "ReviewID": "R3C4XK92NAH270", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a truly excellent home surveillance system with some modern features that are difficult to find on another system at a similar price.First, the H.264 compression is excellent.  This is one of the most compact video compressions available - meaning that it creates a very small video file while still keeping high quality.  You can view these H.264 videos in .mp4 format on any PC or Mac and most smartphones (iPhone, Android).  Smaller files means faster streaming and lower data transfer when I view the videos from my phone.Second, the cameras are daylight and infrared for night vision recording.  The advertised distance is 75 feet of night vision. In my own system, I can easily and clearly see the perimeter of my home up to the fence - which is about 40 feet at the furthest distance.  Also this Q-see infrared shoots in color, while many other system are only night vision black and white.  Don't be put off by the 480p advertised resolution (same as TV).  The cameras are crystal clear and even the night vision is amazing.Third, this system has it's own DVR and processor. Think of it like a stand-alone computer that runs this whole security system. For the price, this is a great deal.  Most other similar priced systems will stream to your PC, so your PC must be on and online for the cameras to record.  I prefer Q-see's setup because I have installed the DVR unit in a closet and can forget about it unless I have a security threat.  I don't have to worry about having the computer off and missing video recordings.  The DVR takes a standard VGA monitor cable. But using a monitor is not necessary since the DVR streams online as well.Fourth, a 500GB hard drive is included - which give me space for 500 hours of recording time at the highest resolution, up to 10,000 hours for the lowest.  500 hours is nearly 3 full weeks of recording time!  And after the hard drive is full, the system will automatically start saving over the oldest video recordings.  Having a hard drive included is great because I can use the system right out of the box.  And since this system is stand-alone. I am not filling up hard drive space on my PC.* I've uploaded a chart that shows the different video settings and how many hours of recording each will give you.And #5 is the apps that are available on iOS (iPhone, iPad), Android and even Kindle.  With a cellular connection or even an internet connection, you can view the live feed from your home, or watch saved recordings.  Up to 20 different users can access your DVR using wireless devices, so you can give permission to family, babysitters or anyone.More thoughts: This Q-see systems uses 8 cameras that must be individually wired to the DVR unit. Yes, a wireless wi-fi setup would be much more convenient, but when it comes to home security, I trust wires much more than wireless. So for me the extra time spent in installation is well worth the peace of mind - knowing that my system will rarely ever stop recording.  Even if the internet connection into my house goes down this system is still running and recording on the DVR.  The only thing that will stop this system from running is a full power loss to the house - which again I have already overcome by adding a battery backup: APC BE550G Back-UPS ES 8 Outlet 550VA 120V.  All-in-all, this system is very dependable and intelligently designed.  Wi-fi cameras may be trendy but not nearly as reliable as this system.Installation:  I have built home computers in the past, replaced parts, etc. but I am in not an expert in hardware. Installation with the Q-see was more complicated that booting up a PC or Mac and installing Windows (because the menu are a bit dated looking and there are a number of options to set), but no where near as complex as building a barebones computer.  Most of my time was spend drilling holes in the walls and running cables. It took me just over 3 hours to do it all. From there on out, it took less than 30 minutes - and was as easy as plugging everything in, booting up the system, and following the Quick Start booklet instruction to set the date/time and your video resolution.All in all, this is one great system that gives you a lot of important features at a very attractive price.  If you are looking for a basic video surveillance system for your home, office, garage, etc, this is definitely worth considering.", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy to set up physically, hard to set up for internet - still, a useful surveillance system for the home or small business", "Author": "N. Andersen", "ReviewID": "R1J4TOYNA2VD1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Q-See 8-Channel Surveillance system is a very useful tool for monitoring your home and small business remotely, and for recording video of what goes on even when you're there.It's easy to set up physically. It comes with everything you need to screw the eight cameras into the wall or ceiling, wherever you like. Each camera comes with a 50 foot cable - and they have to each be physically plugged in to the DVR and into a power cord near to the DVR. That means that if you use them outdoors, you will likely need to drill a hole in the wall so you can run the cables outside. You'll also need to think about where to place the cables strategically. Of course, you can buy additional cable from Q-See if you need to run the wires further. The DVR itself is easy to set up - you'll need to plug it in, though, to a monitor or a television. If you plug it into a monitor you'll need to pick up a VGA cable. If you plug it into a television, you'll need to pick up a BNC to RGA adapter and an RGA video cord. This unit won't connect via HDMI - which makes sense given that the cameras are standard definition.Once you've hooked it all up, you need to set it up. First you set up the DVR, and then hook it up to the network so you can view things remotely. You need to have it plugged in via Ethernet first, and then it takes some time checking the manuals and making sure that your port is open. It took me quite a while, but I finally got it working and it works fine.  As far as I can tell it's going to be different for each system, so anything I figured out would likely not be more helpful than the instruction manual that comes with this. The interface is a bit clunky but it does the trick - and it is pretty cool to be able to see my house when I'm away. There's even an app for the iPhone, that you can set up and view things there.The image quality is fine - it's actually better than I thought. I see surveillance images in the local library and in various gas stations, and this looks a lot crisper than that. It is standard definition - but it's not fuzzy. You can even set it up to do night vision, up to 75', which is pretty fantastic and gives a good sense of security late at night. You can check what's going on without going outside - and, I imagine, that would have been great when we still had babies (and babysitters).This is a pretty good surveillance set up at a reasonable price. It's easy to set up, even if there's a bit of a learning curve when it comes to setting it up for remote viewing. The images look good.

I have never had an entire security camera system before.  Considering all the horror stories from other systems, I was a little wary of setting up the electronics - port forwarding and all that.  Have no fear.  I had it up and running within a few hours.Getting the cameras to work was no problem.  Just plug everything in.  You'll need supply your own cable to the TV or monitor.It was the networking part that was a little frustrating.  If you have AT&T; DSL, beware.  My gateway wouldn't let me do the  UPnP thing.  That's really not the fault of Q-See.Instructions on the two poster size sheets of quickstart pages were clear.  I ran into some glitches.  My fault for typing 3777 instead of 37777.  No wonder it wouldn't work.The software for my PC made adding the cameras automatic.  I suggest doing that instead of going through the browser.  I couldn't connect straight through the browsers.Kindle Fire has three apps that are variations of Q-See.  I picked Q-See QC View HD.  That was perfect for my needs.The images are clear whether I see them on my TV, remotely through my monitor or on my Kindle Fire.  Night vision is excellent.  I am amazed at the details I could see, even across my courtyard in the dark.The biggest drawback I see to the system is the wiring.  That's where I think a wireless system might be better, although I heard clarity suffers.  Eight cameras means eight wires, eight holes through the walls; and we have to attempt to make them all reach within 50 feet of the DVR, which needs ethernet access to the modem.The good thing about the wires is they come directly out the back of the camera.  That way, they can go through the wall behind the camera.  No way can a thief just cut it.We only have to set it up once.  After the wiring and port forwarding are done, just sit back and relax.

It includes 8 cameras and a 500 G DVR than can be accessed either through the home network  or remotely via the internet on a remote PC, tablet or a smartphone. Wires are included.  You can also download specific clips in a USB dongle or an external drive if you need it.As a first time installer it is very helpful to download their full manual and watch some online tutorial videos for setting up the cam.  There will be some learning curve.You get three boxes.  One box houses the DVR, with the remote, the mouse and power supply. It also provides you an ethernet cable to plug your DVR directly to your router.  The other two boxes are identical, 4 cameras on each box, with 4 wires, a power supply and a 4-way splitter so you can hook up all 4 cameras in one power supply.This model doesn't have an HDMI outlet so I chose VGA connection to my TV.  They recommend 19 inch and above, it is recommended to have a big screen so if you are looking at multiple cameras at the same time, it won't be too small to see what is going on.  There are two USB outlets, on the back is for the mouse and the front outlet is for backing up or copying a clip on a USB dongle.  Make sure your the drive you are copying to is formatted FAT32.After hooking up the cameras to the DVR, it is easier  to have another person adjusting the camera while another look at the screen.  That way you don't have to go back and forth, climbing up and climbing down to look at the monitor to see where you are aiming.To gain access to all the function of the DVR, you need to login first.  Login and password will be admin and admin the first time you login, then you can change it later to whatever you want.Video quality is not hi-def but good enough at VGA quality.  The night vision feature is amazing.  Once it gets dark, it switches automatically to night vision.  It will be mostly black and white but it is very clear to see what is going on.  If you look at the camera, you will see the red LEDs on. Hopefully when would be thief or vandals see them, they would stop and move on.I set it up to record when it detect motion.  You can schedule each cam when to start recording.  You can have them record only at night or when you are on vacation, or you can have them record 24/7.  If you look at the screen, you can monitor live feed even when it is not recording.Monitoring remotely with a PC or smartphone would require more technical tinkering with the software.  But you will have the manual and online sources to help you.  It may vary depending on the type of router and setup you have. I have an older WRT160N, but it connected right away using UPNP without any problem.Overall, I am very pleased with this camera system.

My husband had no trouble setting up the cameras and networking them. The picture quality is pretty good, not perfect, but enough if you are using it to monitor children on the other end of the house or your home when you are not there.My only real complaint about this product is the software. The software on the DVR is ok - it takes some getting used to - the different areas should be labeled more clearly so you can find what you want, but it's not that bad. The real problem is the software for iOS. One of the main reason I got this was because you could monitor your cameras from your iPhone or iPad.Unfortunately the iOS apps are complete crap. They crash constantly, and half of the functions do not even work. For example, taking a photo doesn't work. It DID work for my husband on his iPhone4 until he upgraded to iOS 6 and then he couldn't even do it any more.  On the iPhone you can only watch 4 cameras at a time, understandably because of the screen size, but the quality isn't quite as nice as if you are watching it from the monitor hooked up to the DVR. iPad can show all cameras, but it crashes quite a bit.But, honestly, for the price I got this for (it was a daily deal) and aside from the iOS app problems - this works wonderfully.

This is my first DVR video system. I spent several days stringing wires through my insulation filled attic before actually powering up the system.  Included with the system is a DVD and quick start guides that don't contain everything needed for setup.  The installation guide shows a HDMI port that my unit does not have but I didn't realize that until after I bought a HDMI cable long enough to reach our TV.  Q-See has lots of online resources and their customer support was very helpful, always answering emails promptly. Even with these resources I got so frustrated that I called Amazon about a return but that wasn't practical due to the installed wiring. One of the issues I encountered involved the remote control that must be activated to function but no activation instructions in the user manual that I had to download because there wasn't one with the system.  Getting the port forwarding and IP addresses set up took a while and a lot of help.  After all this, the DVR started setting off false alarms and locking accounts every day. Numerous emails to Q-See (first Faith, then Mike and finally Jose) resolved the issue as TIVO remote control interference.  The channel down selection on a TIVO remote control will activate the DVR login. Several down selections, such as when paging down the TIVO guide, activates the DVR account lock and warning beeps that add up to a continuous squeal until all the login attempts have run their course.  Our TIVO unit and the DVR are a couple yards apart but on the same side of the room.  Q-See says there is no way to change the DVR IR function and we want to control both the TIVO and DVR from our recliners so we can either be careful with the TIVO channel down selection or retrain our fingers to always channel up.

Some reviewers of their other DVRs complained about difficult setup. We haven't found anything very puzzling. The smartphone interface could be better but it's not bad. The cameras stand out and their presence alone makes our house look well protected.", "Date": "October 23, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008YQR8IY"}}
