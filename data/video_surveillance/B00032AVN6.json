{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Extremely simple, effective, and VERY loud alarm system", "Author": "E. Kim", "ReviewID": "RY99SFN3ETJTI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I live in an apartment and wanted to add an inexpensive alarm system that could serve as a deterrent to intruders.  I know that this GE system cannot substitute for a centralized alarm system in which authorities/police are immediately notified, but I felt that the activation of a loud alarm could scare off an unsuspecting burglar and was far better than not having any alarm system.  It could also serve to wake you up at night as soon as a window or door is opened, giving you precious seconds to call 911, freak out, pray, reach for your 9mm, etc.  (I mean this jokingly, but nevertheless, it is better than waking up to an intruder by your bedside.)The main door unit is extremely easy to set up.  You unscrew the back and install 3 AAA batteries and program a 4 digit code.  You can also set the device to serve as a simple door chime, instead of an alarm if you desire.  You mount the door device and its accompanying magnetic sensor to the door frame and to the door.  The kit includes double-sided tape and the sensors have openings for you to use a woodscrew.  I just chose to use some double-sided Velcro tape but obviously, it would be better to screw the sensors in directly.Once you activate the alarm, you have 45 seconds to leave your apt/home.  When you want to enter your armed home, you open your door, and then are given 30 seconds to punch in your alarm before it is triggered.  This alarm is very loud, and I believe will at least startle most unsuspecting burglars and also potentially wake up your neighbors.The kit also includes 3 very simple window alarm and sensor pairs.  These are very easy to set up as they only have an on/off switch (besides the battery test switch).  You simply attach the sensor pairs to the windows and flip the switch to on.  If you want to open your window, you have to flip the switch to off, then open.  These are really just deterrents, but I believe effective.  In theory, an extremely relaxed, prepared burglar could just open your windows, study the device, and realize that he had to just flip the switch off.  While the door alarm is very loud, the window alarms are not nearly that loud and perhaps just acceptable.Again, if you live in an apartment without any alarm system presently, this system is infinitely better than not having anything.  The alarm is so shockingly loud, that I sleep better at night knowing that I would be notified the very first moment an intruder enters (minus the 30 second \"grace period\" for the alarm to trigger).  This can be a part of a more comprehensive security plan, which could include stronger door/window locks, lighting, signs of alarm system, alarm, guard dogs, self-defense education, TASER, pepperspray, tactical flashlight, firearms, etc.  You must tailor a security system to your own specific needs, budget, practical concerns, etc.", "Date": "February 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Door and Window alarms are very audible and effective.", "Author": "Marmalade", "ReviewID": "R3R22UYMUXGC6E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading the reviews posted here, I was actually surprised at the loudness of the 3 window alarms.  Perhaps the batteries were fresh, because all of the window and the door alarms I received are piercingly loud at 120-decibels.  The kits I received did come with all the necessary screws and double-sided tape to install the door and window alarms.  But, I used double-sided Velcro tape (as recommended by a reviewer) and this has worked like a charm!  Using chime mode, the kits have been very effective alert systems for toddlers in the house.  Also, if strategically placed, a burglar won't be able to see the window alarm attached to the frame.  It would be nice if the chime made a double set of 'ding-dong' sounds instead of a single set, but this is the only mild complaint I have about chime mode.  Also, the door system is pretty effective in alarm mode.  The alarm will continue to pierce even if the door is closed after being opened, so the only way to turn off the sound is to enter your 4-digit code.All in all, more than I expected and I'm extremely satisfied.", "Date": "January 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Just What I Needed", "Author": "LitWit \"Lacey\"", "ReviewID": "RE8QCH75T4IQC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a college student living in a college town apartment complex with a fiance who is gone the majority of the week for work this alarm system allows me to sleep peacefully at night.  As a worrier who is 26 years old I have read one too many accounts of terrible incidents occurring at night.  I am attending a college in the heart of the Midwest and my apartment building is well lit and closer to cornfields than anything anyone would consider a threat.  However, with college gearing up, kids getting rowdy, and a sea of unidentifiable people; one never knows what might happen...better safe than sorry.  This system provided three alerts for windows (of which I have three) and while the alarm sounding is softer than the main sounding you will hear on the door it is more than sufficient for my space.  There is no possible way I would not hear any one of the three if they were triggered.  The alarm sounding on the door is just plain loud...I suspect it would wake the entire apartment complex were it triggered.  There are two setting on the door alarm one is HOME...it is what I set in the evenings before heading to bed.  In the HOME mode the alarm will sound if the door is opened 1/2 inch and it will continue to sound until the door is closed or the code is entered.  The other mode the door offers is the AWAY mode...this is what I set when leaving.  In AWAY mode once door is opened one has 30 seconds to disarm the system before the alarm sounds.  Alarm can only be turned off when code is entered.  The window alarms have a CHIME or ALARM setting on them.  When switched to ALARM the alarm will sound when the window is opened 1/2 inch and continue sounding until the window is closed.  This systems primary function is to act as a deterrent for an intruder.  I would say that 99 out of 100 times the system will do its job at deterring crime.  However, if an intruder is determined or has the knowledge of the system they will know that in HOME mode the alram will cease to sound once the door is closed again...just as the windows will cease when they are once again closed.  In such a case I would argue that the system still buys one precious seconds they need to telephone for help...nothing is perfect.  I would reccommend this system to any young girl living on their own or any parent looking to keep their children safe away from home.", "Date": "August 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "OK, but not great", "Author": "B.

One of our soon-to-be neighbors told us that they saw some random people snooping around the new house at 2:00 a.m. What are the odds that someone at a construction site at 2:00 a.m. has any good intentions? Enter: need for an immediate burglar alarm system. The house is wired for a professional home security system, but we can't activate it yet until more construction is complete. I looked up battery-operated alarm systems and decided to try the GE system kit because of the mostly positive reviews.Overall, I think the system kit will fit most our needs. It's not the fanciest, but it's loud enough to wake up next door neighbors during the night and call attention to our house. I set the door alarm off while testing it out, and my ears were ringing for almost 30 min. As discussed in other reviews, the alarms might not be enough to protect against the more determined burglars, but I think it will ward off most. Plus, when combined with motion-activated floodlights and other defense measures, it becomes just another way to make burglars reconsider their plan.Setting the door alarm code is simple, and installation is easy after reading the instructions. I like the door alarm, but I wish it was not so bulky. The window alarms are not as loud as the door alarm, but they are still pretty loud. After installing the window alarms, I realized that my positioning of them made the \"alarm, chime, off\" label visible to an outsider looking in. I am probably going to run a black sharpie across the label so it won't look as obvious that it's an alarm, and hopefully the burglar won't go right to it.I have not come across any problems with false alarms yet. Hopefully that won't happen because the alarms are not on a timer and will continue to blare unless deactivated. Also, I live 30 mins away and will not know about any alarms going off unless a neighbor or police call me since the alarms are not tied to a phone system. The alarms are not controlled by a central unit, which makes it a little incovenient since I have to turn off all door/window alarms individually before the construction crew arrives. A little inconvenience, however, is still way better than having stuff stolen or the house vandalized.If you go to Youtube and do a search for \"GE Personal Security JascoProducts,\" there should be a professional video and you can see a demonstration of the window alarm. Also, buying this kit on Amazon is a good value. I decided to buy more of these kits, and I saw either the exact same or almost the same GE kit (it had a door alarm and three window alarms) at Lowe's going for $36/each!UPDATE, November 29, 2011: It's been a few months now, and I've since installed a professional home security system. Overall, I am really happy with the GE alarms. Nobody tried to break in (fortunately), so we didn't have any real tests (no false alarms either!). A few things I noticed: First, one of our door alarms would require a few trys before recognizing the disarm code. Second, as previously mentioned in other reviews, it might be hard to install the door alarm if you have non-flat decorative door trim. The only reason I was able to use the door alarms is because I used the blue painters tape to stick the little door alarm magnet at an angle on the door trim, which made the doors pretty unsightly. You should be ok if you can stick a popsicle stick flat against your door trim at the site of the door magnet; otherwise, you may have get creative or consider not getting this product. I removed all the GE alarms after installing the professional security system, but I plan on keeping some for future use and giving others to family and friends.", "Date": "August 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "works as advertised.", "Author": "P.

I will say that I am impressed with how loud the door units are but thats about the only positive comment I can come up with, and thats being generous.The window units are cheesy.  It's disappointing there is no way of permanently mounting the window units. Comes with 2 sided tape (pretty lame).  Although, it's probably a good thing since the window units are more like toys than anything.  If a thief did manage to hear the window unit alarm going off he might laugh so hard that he falls back out the window. So you can always bank on that happening anyways.The door units do not fit securely into the mounting bracket when placed on the door.  There is a flaw in the bracket design that allows to much play where the alarm unit merges with the mounting bracket.  It rattles around like the cheap junk that it is.There should be an indicator LED letting you know if the alarm is actually armed or not for the door units.  The only way to tell if it is armed is by entering in your pass code and then seeing if it beeps once for (armed) or twice for (disarmed).  Otherwise there is no way to tell if it's actually armed.The keypad on the door units if very annoying.  When you press the buttons to arm or disarm the alarm they make an piercing loud beep.

Even though I live in a neighborhood with a very low crime rate, I still like having these alarms.  This device is easy to use, easy to mount, and easy to set up.  It took me all of 10 minutes to have all 4 alarms up and running in my apartment.  I have one on the front door, one on my sliding glass door and the other two on windows.As far as the complaints of it not being loud enough: In my apartment it is plenty loud.  I have set it off on purpose to test it and it was ear shattering!  Now, if you have a 2000-3000sq ft house then maybe I could agree with it not being loud enough depending on where you have it.  In an average size house or apartment though I think it is perfect.I also like the fact that the front door alarm has a code you can enter in (that you choose) when you leave the house to arm/disarm.

Go figure. Anyway, I've started to review the several home monitoring alarm companies but this may take a while to decide so I thought until then I will need at least some basic deterrents for my windows and doors. Here's what I feel so far after receiving these today. I really like the window alarms. They are really loud, install easily, and can be shut off entirely if wanted. Let's face it. All we can hope from an alarm is to scare a potential burglar away with a very loud noise. These will serve that purpose. One thing I wanted to dispute from other reviews here is the notion that window and window frame have to be exactly flush for these to work. Not the case! Yeah, they cant be really off, obviously, but mine are not flush by close to a 1/4 inch and they work fine. Bottom line is that if you are looking for something quick and basic, these will do the trick. After some research on alarm systems I feel it's debatable whether a system monitored by an offsite company really adds any benefit. Your ultimately hoping to scare the intruders into thin king the jig is up and they better split. These, coupled with some alarm signs for the lawn purchased seperately may be all most people need.

Reeves", "ReviewID": "R12Y2C2N1EX3RV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Well, I read all the reviews and decided to give it a shot since it is one of Amazon's best-sellers, though I think that is only because it's cheaper than other sets out there. Anyway, I bought three sets and I put them all up the day they arrived. Here is what I found...1. Sound - the door sensors are far louder than the window sensors, so depending on your needs, this may or may not work for you. The chime and alarm on the window sensors are also about the same volume, unlike the door sensor. The door sensor's volume is significantly louder during the door's alarm than it is for the door chime. In hindsight, if solely based on volume, I would prefer to use door sensors for the windows instead. It's hard to hear the window alarm from the other room if the house isn't dead silent (meaning, if you're watching a football game or playing with the kids.. you may not hear it at all).2. Placement - I chose to use the double-sided tape since I may be moving soon. The double-sided tape works well for most of the sensors if the surface is completely flat or glass. On the painted wood in my doorway, I found it not to be so strong, so I went and bought a stronger adhesive for the doorway. On my windows, the tape stuck very well to the glass and only one of them has fallen down on it's own thus far. The one that fell was in the sun and within a humid room, so my guess is that the sun's heat and room's humidity affected the tape somehow? Other than that, placing them was easy and the instructions on house to do so were simple.3. Practical? - Mmm, only if you understand that this is simply a warning or \"heads up\" that should be supplemented otherwise. I strongly discourage anyone from using this as their sole \"warning\" system of any kind since I have found it to be unreliable so far (see below) however it's a good addition to your home when it works or if you can keep it working somehow. For the sake of testing it out, I played devil's advocate on one in my room and tried to see how easy it is to remove if I were a burglar. Well, these aren't too hard to yank off the windows, and it is foolishly easy to, even accidentally, remove the battery panel where the batteries are located and knock just one battery out..which shuts the entire alarm OFF instantly. Like I said...you'll need a backup. OK, for chime-use only if that is all you need it for, but for burglar-alerts, not so much. However...4. Quality and Performance... Both are lacking. The plastic is cheap and the battery covers on the window sensors can be accidentally removed far too easily. The battery test is also faulty too. They all tested bright green when I first opened the package and the product claims these batteries should last awhile... but a couple of mine lasted no more than a few hours. I had put those two window sensors up in the hall and later one went off, making noises much like that of a toy running out of battery power. Then it just died.. so I tested the other, and the other one's light wouldn't turn green and the sensor wouldn't make noise at all when I opened the window. This was frustrating for me because I tested every single sensor's placement (meaning I made sure it was no more than the designated width apart) before and after installing them - and then I tested them all on alarm and chime mode by opening the doors and windows they were placed upon. Most of them have no gap at all and were working fine earlier! And worse still, the chime function works only sometimes. I have completely opened and closed my doors and windows a few times and if I do it about 5 times in a row, it will make a noise 3 of the five times. And this morning, I thought I had forgotten to set me door alarm because it didn't go off when the door opened, so I put in my code and tried testing it and it still wouldn't go off. So I switched it to \"chime\" and it went off after a try or two, so I went back to \"alarm\" and put in my code...and THEN it worked. So, like I said, great concept and these would be acceptable if they were reliable... Heaven forbid anyone ever comes into our home that shouldn't but I don't feel any sort of confidence in this product knowing this kit might or might not work to alert me.I will give these another day (buying new batteries and going to retest them all) and will write an update as to whether they get worse or better...  major bummer since I really wanted these to be good. And for anyone with kids or loved ones... we all know that a product like this that only works \"sometimes\" isn't good enough. It only takes ONE incident where a chime or alarm doesn't go off to be the difference between knowing if your kid is safely inside or not..

The glass had been broken out of our front door, so that is why I chose this alarm kit.  It consists of 2 window alarms and 1 door/window alarm/chime.  I put 2 of the window alarm devices on the glass on our back door, 1 on the replaced & reinforced glass on our front door, and the door chime on the front door.  Each of the alarms consists of 2 parts: a unit about the size of your thumb and another piece the size of your pinky finger.  You affix the window alarms so that if the glass is broken, a VERY LOUD (120 db) alarm sounds constantly until until you physically place the switch in the \"off\" position.  I use the door alarm/chime as the chime function, since my husband is partially deaf and benefits from the chime to alert him to a customer entering the store.  The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is that I was NOT able to get the door unit to sound with the alarm function.  It may be that I did not wait long enough after I set the password for it to sound.  Using this unit as a chime works better for us than constantly arming and disarming an alarm, so I did not bother to call the ocmpany about instructions to get that function to work.I don't think that this alarm kit is the total answer for detering burglars, but it is a good start.  Prior to buying this kit, I beefed up our door security by installing deadbolts that require a key on both sides rather than the less secure, 1 key variety we previously had.  I also plan to get door security grilles in the near future to provide additional security.  That way, a burglar will have to literally take the door off the hinges to break in.  If they first try to pry the door open and then break the glass, our security alarms will sound and alert neighbors & police while they scare the thief away!", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "got this for my autistic son who kept getting out of the house", "Author": "Jennibutch", "ReviewID": "R1V1ARGSYXAS2V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this because my six year old son is an escape artist.

Note that this alarm system is just that, give you a heads up warning, not to be confused with those call the cops alarm systems, instead this should buy you precious minutes in case something is wrong.Great product, even useful if not for security purposes but to add to a window in case you have kids and want a warning they are opening a not so safe window or door.", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "DO THE JOB", "Author": "Y.

I will say that the alarms are not linked (example: If the window alarm goes off, the door and other window alarms have no idea it is going off, and do not trigger. Thus, the system functions as 4 separate alarms). The set up is easy, with easy directions. If you don't want to pay high fees with alarm companies, this is the next best thing. A wonderful product on amazon! Oh and one last thing...the window alarms all come with batteries but the door alarm does not.

The product is very easy to use and the install is very quick. Just clean the surface with rubbing alcohol, allow it to dry, apply double sided tape to product, double check alignment, and peel & stick each piece. The item is very loud and can easily be heard by the neighbors if you live in a subdivision. While installing the window sensors I tested the alignment a few times and the neighbor kept looking outside. This item is not a real alarm system but is perfect for making you feel better. As long as the alarm is set, they will go off whenever a window or door is open. This gives you a warning and a few extra seconds to call 911, get your gun, bat, knife, or pepper spray. For anyone other than a career criminal the item is loud enough to scare them off.As for the reviewers saying that the alarm doesn't go off for 30-45sec when the door is open needs to adjust the setting to HOME. When its set to home the alarm goes off the second the 1/2\" gap is made. The AWAY mode is when you have 45 seconds to leave and 30 seconds to turn off the alarm when entering the house.I also ordered the door stop alarmsGE 50246 Smart Home Door Stop Alarm for them and those are extremely loud. With these 2 item and making sure they keep all doors, gates and windows locked they feel a lot safer. My in-laws are in their late 60's and still think that people are nice and honest like they used to be. They went from never locking anything and leaving doors and windows open all the time to locking everything. Most crimes are opportunity crimes, keep your doors, windows and gates locked. Don't leave your blinds open showing off your big screen tv, surround sound, gaming systems, computers, cameras, etc......Also do not allow door to door sales people in your home, many are felons and are scoping your place out. My in laws experienced this the day before someone tried to get into their back yard. A guy came by trying to sell a cleaning product and a little while later a lady came by trying to sell the same product. It was after my father in law left (no cars in driveway) and the lady pushed on the door when my mother in law said no and tried to shut the door. When I brought up the door to door sales people she mentioned this to me. She said the lady wanted to see what products my mother in law could use in her home.

It was robbed 2 weeks after I moved (through the fire escape window). The crooks stole thousands of dollars worth of things, but most of all, I felt so violated. I live in an older pre-war building in Queens NY, so I wasn't sure if a real alarm system would be cost-effective, plus I not even sure how long I'll be living there (and you need a landline, which I gave up years ago). With that said I purchased this package because I had the freedom to set my own 4 digit code for the door alarm. I thought this would be a good way to scare off any potential intruders if they broke in through the door or fire escape windows.They were easy to set up, the door alarm was easy to set as well. I originally had it set to the \"chime\" feature, but it was so obnoxiously loud. I knew my neighbors would not be happy with me if they had to hear it every time I came in and out of my apartment. The alarms are very loud as well. My boyfriend \"accidentally\" tested one of the window alarms one afternoon and it was loud enough for people on many floors to hear. I also like the option to set them on/off/chime so I have the freedom to open an alarmed window while I'm home. I feel a lot more comfortable leaving the apartment for long periods of time now that I have these.Learn from my misfortune!

However, when I bought a separate package of window GE window alarms (Comes in a package of 4), they were much louder. Maybe because they had a thin film of plastic under the batteries that you have to pull out before using. The 3 window alarms that came in this Kit did not have a plastic under the batteries. Maybe this is why the sound is a little less piercing, because the batteries are a little older. But don't be mistaken, they still hurt your ears! The main reason I bought this was because I'm going to stay in a one story vacation home in Utah, which is a little ways from the main town, and the pictures of the home showed that there is a glass door opening to the yard for each bedroom. I am planning to take these little door and window alarms with me and mount them to every one of these glass doors and windows in the house. Best advise I can give is to buy clear mounting tape (The kind that you can peel off after which doesn't cause any paint damage). Then you can pretty much adjust these guys to any window sill (new or old, molding or no molding).  I also would NOT recommend using the \"Away\" feature of the bigger alarm when you are at home, because it takes too long to go off when tripped.  A burglar could easily come in the house, take what he needs in 30 seconds, and leave before the alarm goes off. So keep it on \"Home\" when you are home. When I am out of the house, i'll probably put it on \"Away\", so that I can exit the house and still have an alarm activated. Just remember when you have it activated because there is no light that tells you when it is on. And you don't want to make the mistake of going deaf to these very loud alarms. Overall, I am very happy with this system and with the smaller window alarms. I like the fact that you need a screw driver to open the back of the main box in order to program your code. Otherwise, anyone can get there hands on it and reprogram it. I feel much more comfortable heading to this Utah vacation condo. I'm sure many people have copies of keys to this condo, and this will keep the cleaning crew and maintenance people out when I am in the house. Another thing I will do is put a sign \"Beware of Dog\" and \"alarm signs\" on the windows of the house.I'm not sure how long this system will last, but we'll see. It's nice that it only requires 3 AAA batteries (not included) for the main alarm, and 4 small round batteries (included) for the window alarms.", "Date": "April 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "ok", "Author": "shoelover", "ReviewID": "R31MDZ6PYNWBQ3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had hard time to disassemble the door alarm to put battery in.

Crime is very low in our area, and I didn't feel the need to buy an expensive alarm system or to add a service.  These sounded like they would fit my needs well.  I will say that in alarm mode, these little units put out more sound than I thought possible... they do work!  The small units are designed for use with windows, and they're ideal.  They simply stick on with double-sided tape and they're small enough to place out of sight.  A switch allows you to turn them off as necessary, too.The unit with the keypad for use with a door is a bit different.  It's substantially larger and the siren in it is indeed louder, but the keypad function just doesn't cut it for me.  Too often I've turned the unit on instead of off, or the buttons failed to work when I entered the code, and the alarm goes off and is difficult to turn off.  I ended up tearing the unit off the door (which is easy because of the double-stick tape) and smashed it on the floor to shut it up when I couldn't turn it off.  It went into the trash.I did have an extra window monitor, so I placed that on the door.  With the switch, I can set it to act as a doorbell of sorts, chiming when the door is opened.  That's perfect for my needs; more useful to me than the alarm.

I like this system because its not too permanent, and its very easy to hear from anywhere.Window Installation:Window installation was a breeze after a bit of thinking. I couldn't mount them in the typical way because of the molding. However, I was able to very easily mount them on the bottom of the window on the window ledge. I mounted the magnet on the window putting the tape on the side of the magnet (not the back) and mounted the alarm on the window sill with the tape on the back like normal.Door Installation:Had to use a spacer (foarm board) to get the door alarm far enough out to reach the magnet mounted on the molding. The manufacturer does include a kind of mounting gadget that brings it off the door slightly so maybe they could also include a larger one that extends the device farther out. But they can't reasonable include all possible mounting hardware to work with all possible door designs so I don't fault them for that. If you're basically installing a $23 home alarm system yourself, you probably have a little bit of ingenuity and can make it work.To those whose house is too large to hear all the window alarms: If your house is that big, you should probably spend more than $23 on a home alarm system. Like a full featured home security system.I don't mind the deactivation switches on the window alarms. I figure it would take at least 3-5 seconds for a bandit to figure it out which should be enough to get your attention no matter what you are doing. It may not wake your neighbors if you aren't home but it is just stuff that can be replaced, mostly (renter's insurance is a beautiful thing). I'd rather know if someone is in my home while I'm home also in case the burglar is of the dangerous/armed variety.

No one can get up to our windows anyway, so I am not too worried about it.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great system for the money", "Author": "happy shopper", "ReviewID": "RON8XU2UVYEN8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These alarms work really well, are really loud and help me feel secure.  I have bought cheaper versions and I would say it is definitely worth it to spend the extra money for the GE product.  They are very easy to install with the sticky tape they come with.  These will definitely scare someone off, maybe even alert the neighbors, and give you the time and warning you may need to take precautionary measures.  They are also good to keep tabs if you have little ones.

I woke up last night at 4:30 in the morning to the sound of the back door alarm going off and my girlfriend freaking out. Half asleep I reached for my shotgun. With the mix of complete drowsiness, anxiety and adrenaline, I made my way out the bedroom and down our stairs (shotgun in hand). Our stairs are L shaped with a wall about half the way to the top. So I could be walking into a gunshot before I even see anyone. I make it about halfway down and realize this could be the end of mine or another persons life. Once I have a visual of the kitchen to which I am walking in, I see no one. I then approach the back door, which has the alarm and get ready for what's next To my complete pleasure the alarm has just become loose and was at a 45* tilt which made the alarm go off. Thank god.

Whether hearing has been affected remains to be seen. I can't imagine anyone with children or pets wanting this device in their home. If it goes off while you're not there, it seems to me that it could kill your pet with their sensitive hearing.  If an intruder comes into your home, he/she will certainly regret it, and so will you.

I am a licensed master electrician and although I do not install security systems for a living, I am technically inclined. I followed the instructions closely and the system works very well with a few glitches in the programing. The Motion sensors should only activate when they are manually activated when going to bed at night. This should be separate from the doors and windows. If you get up in the middle of the night to get a drink of water the alarm goes off. Also, there should be a delay so that when the motion sensors are activated, you have time to deactivate them prior to the alarm siren. Getting up in the morning I don't have enough time to get across the kitchen to deactivate the system before the siren goes off and I get my ears blasted. I know that the system can be adjusted to eliminate this problem but I cannot get help from GE. When I call their tech support it will not give me a live person to talk with and if you tell it you are a home owner it says to call your professional installer and then hangs up on you. I sent three emails to GE tech support and they never responded. All I need to do is get a simple verbal instruction to set the program since this is not addressed in the instructions. GE simply turns their back on you once they sell you a product. This is not the first time this has happened to me with a GE product. Also, all of the literature with the Simon XT wireless system says that you can use it with  alight module to turn your lights on and off remotely or with the control panel. This cannot be done. Apparently, according to the company that supplies the light modules, GE printed their literature prematurely and after production they found that the modules would not work with the transformer supplied with the system. GE went ahead and sold it anyway and just tells everyone that bought it that it doesn't work and they're just out of luck. Too bad, so sad. Shame on you GE!!! I have disconnected my $500.00 system because it doesn't work properly and I cannot get any technical support for simple programing help.", "Date": "December 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Wireless Term is Misleading - Not Interconnected", "Author": "G.
