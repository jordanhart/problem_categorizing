{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not Bad", "Author": "MICHAEL B.", "ReviewID": "R25200VY0TEQ7P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased these to replace my eight year old Sony CCD bullets. While these are not CCD but CMOS, they are not bad. CCD will always be better but twice the cost. The night vision (BW mode) is very good. The day (color), while accurate in colors, is not to overly saturated. The camera has a nice wide angle lens; however, is not that clear. The grass looks pixelated and does not truly focus all the way. while my three year old Monoprice 600TVL Sony CCD is amazing.  The quality of the camera housing is not bad either. It is aluminum alloy and the camera adjustments on the mount are easy, albeit, not the very best.  Overall it is not a bad choice. But not my first. You have to remember there are only a few CMOS and CCD manufactures and all the companies just rebrand them.", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$299.99", "Features": "700 TV lines, 4.6mm Lens, NTSC format;Both indoor outdoor use\nWith 42IR Leds for night vision up to 100ft.(night vision appears in B&W;, day viewing in color)\nSilver Color, 4 pieces, adjustable stand\nIP66.
