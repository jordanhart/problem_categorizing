{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Ready for Prime Time?", "Author": "MJB", "ReviewID": "R1MCQ431ZKX3QZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The IP302PI looks impressive -- very small and well made. The image is fine and the user interface is acceptable.  There are two concerns that have led to this low rating -- both of which I hope are changed in the near future.First, after having spent many hours trying, I have been unable to add this camera to the other 12 cameras (FOSCAM and TRENDnet) that I am using with Blue Iris -- or several of my iPad apps.Second, security on the TRENDnet cameras appears less robust than Foscam, which is surprising given the controversy over this issue in the past year with TRENDnet.  The glaring security issues from the past have been fixed.  However, one can't change the default administrator username from \"admin\".  Nor can one use special characters in the password. So if I was a hacker looking to break into cameras, I'd target TRENDnet over Foscam.I do hope the problems are resolved, in which case I will be glad to revise the rating and update the review.UPDATEBlue Iris just issued an update and a fix for the IP302PI was included. It is now possible to get the IP302PI's image to work with this software.  I have added one star to the rating as a result (from 2 stars to 3 stars).  However, the camera seems far less impressive than the similarly priced Hikvision 3MP bullet camera now entering the market.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good, only one minor drawback.", "Author": "Michael Lay \"mlay\"", "ReviewID": "R1UZ9FZI3RAJSH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "All in all this is a good camera for home surveillance, better than the Trendnet IP-322 I originally bought.  This one has a wider viewing angle, and is very clear -- good daytime visual.  The night vision is adequate, but not great.  I would guess someone would have to be within 15' of it to be recognizable at night.My only problem with it is that the software that comes with this one is slightly different than the 322.  The way that you set up motion detection is far inferior.  The 322 allowed me to see in real time how much motion things like wind blowing tree branches caused, and set the notification limit accordingly.  This one just makes you choose a level, and even on the lowest setting it is nearly worthless.  On a partly cloudy day or windy day I was getting 100+ notifications over the course of the afternoon.  This was something that was important to me, but now I will have to do without it.  If the 302 had the 322 motion detection setup it would be perfect...", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love the cameras", "Author": "Carlos Midence", "ReviewID": "R1YFQ864WR7PLS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the cameras they work perfectly.
