It's a wireless alarm mechanism that senses motion with the detection unit and triggers an alarm in the receiver.  While billed as a driveway alert device, it's really only limited by your imagination.  If there's somewhere around your house that you need to monitor for movement, this would work reasonably well.  For what I wanted it for, it does what it claims.The motion detector can either be permanently mounted on a surface or clipped into place with the bracket on the back.  The cone-shaped detection range can be adjusted to sense motion at 15 or 30 ft, and runs off of four AA batteries.  It's a little on the heavy side for its size,  so you have to account for that when you decide where to place it.  The alert unit runs off of AC power, and emits a series of beeps (volume is adjustable) when the detector picks up motion.  It's a basic uncomplicated setup and configuration, and it does what it says... detects motion and alerts you.In my case, I work from home and my office is in the basement.  As such, I don't always hear when someone is at the front door.  Given that package delivery services often drop off stuff on our front porch, I like to make sure that I get the package relatively soon so that it doesn't just sit out there.  With this unit, I can set the detector to cover the front porch, and the receiver lets me know when something arrives.  It's a simple solution that works as advertised.Would l change stuff if I could? Sure... a lighter weight would be nice.  Being able to recharge the unit instead of feeding it batteries would be a major plus.

It works sometimes when a car comes up the driveway and then it's wonderful and then it stops working but will go off when a crow flies past but not when a car comes up the driveway.  On the day the farmer came to mow our field, it went off almost continually even though I have it aimed at the driveway and not at the field.  I even hired a handyman to fine tune it thinking I must be doing something wrong but it was still the same - sometimes it works and sometimes not and there's no rhyme or reason to it.  I put it inside a birdhouse to protect it, then took it out, placed it up high, in the middle, down low etc.  It's not hard to set up - quite easy in fact - if only it would work consistently.

Because of this, we have set up our bedroom downstairs in our basement so it's easier to sleep throughout the daylight hours. But as expected, people come to the house during the day (i.e. UPS, USPS, Fed-Ex, friends, neighborer, family, etc). Being downstairs, often he can not hear anyone knock on the door when they show up. Having this unit set up downstairs lets him know when someone has pulled up and is coming up to our porch.Also, his job picks him up for work each evening during shift change (he's in law enforcement and shares a work car with his partner). There is a 15 minute window of time each evening when he can be picked up for work, so he use to stand in the doorway and watch for them to arrive the whole time. Now having this driveway alert system, it lets him know when they are pulling in so he can do other things until it goes off and lets him know they have pulled up.I find the units features work similarly to the same way a motion lights does. The settings can be changed to be more of less sensitive and the volume of the alert is adjustable. We have a lot of animals such as deer and birds always around and tons of pedestrians walking dogs and kids on bikes going by, but we set it up in a location that is typically on trafficked by cars coming in the driveways or someone walking up our driveways to come up our porch. By picking out the location carefully, it keeps everything else from setting off the alarm all day and night.

Though it goes as far as 30 feet (and our driveway is longer), it did alert us the minute a person pulled into our driveway. Before they even get out of their car, we can look out and see who it is. This is great for those occasions when you have company coming and don't want to have to keep getting up to look out the window for their car. What I liked most about this is knowing when my youngest child pulls into the driveway at night. The shortcoming, but not something I was looking for, was it only senses presence - others who want something more comprehensive might want to invest in an outside camera (which we also have since living in the country left us open to a near robbery in the past - foiled by my dogs).This is overall a very good product that is easy to use.

Once the two units have been paired, you have a choice between low and high sensitivity. This is chosen on the remote device before the battery cover is applied. You therefore will need to test the unit in the desired location before closing things up and mounting the remote. The instructions were acceptable.The base unit is configured to work with up to three remotes. It remains paired with the chosen remote even when turned off and on again. However, it does not remember which remotes you've chosen to use through a duty cycle. That is, let's say you have two remotes but only want the base unit to alert you for Remote #1. Perhaps Remote #2 will only be used on certain occasions. You set the unit to alert only for Remote #1, turn the unit off, then on again, and now it is alerting you for both remotes - once again you have to set the unit to Remote #1; this isn't a big deal - just something you need to remember to do.The alert itself is a rather harsh beeping sound. Really, in today's digital audio world, a less harshly charactered beep would be nice as an alternative. While there's a volume dial on one side, I found it to be of little help. Either it's doing nothing at all, or the range of control is minimal. I can't tell. There's a lighting mute switch on the side. All it does is turn off the green LED's that indicate which Remote/s will lead to an alert. The bright blue LED in the center that indicates whether the unit is on stays lit even when the green LEDs are turned off.The remote does not work through glass. I was hopeful that I could mount it in the window near my front door, but that wouldn't work. The unit is water resistant but not waterproof, so mounted outside it will eventually suffer from the exposure. Luckily, I have an overhang that allows for exterior mounting. In my case the unit is set up to alert me if anyone approaches the door. It has done so without fail, with the wireless transmitter successfully reaching my base station through two feet of solid granite and then fifty more feet to the base unit. It's a nice way of knowing if a package has been delivered or if the mail has arrived, as delivery folks don't usually ring the bell.There are some obvious issues if you aim it in such a way that it might see movement from bushes and trees, or if the neighbor's cat walks by. This is a sensitivity issue as well as an aiming issue, so be prepared to realign the unit after you've had a few days of observation as to what works and doesn't work. All necessary mounting hardware is included as are the four AA batteries necessary for the wireless remote.I'm pleased with the overall function but would like to see some improvements:1) the lighting switch on the base unit should turn off the green LEDs and dim the center blue LED.2) the volume knob and related circuitry needs improved specification. Determining the volume setting should not require the alarm to be going off, as it does now. That is, moving the volume knob itself should generate a tone so that you quickly know what the actual alarm volume will be.3) the sensitivity of the remote should be able to be set from the base unit.4) there should be some optional alert tones - something more doorbell-like than a klaxon would be nice.", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good for a motion detector", "Author": "J.

Luu", "ReviewID": "R1NB9CDW35YI5S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been testing this Driveway Alert System for several days now.  Basically this is a remote motion sensor.  It lets out a series of chirps as long as motion is detected.Things I like:1.  Easy to set up.  Receiver and base paired easily.2.  Alarm is nice and loud, but adjustable to a lower volume.3.  Batteries and all mounting hardware is included4.  One base can handle 3 different zones5.  Motion detector works well.  I've tested it out to 50 feet, and it works great.Things I don't like1.  Both base and detector is larger than necessary.  The base is about the size of an Iphone, 3x the thickness.  The detector is a bit bigger2.  Very plastic, almost flimsy construction.  I have serious doubt that the detector would last very long in a fully exposed environment.3.  On windy days, I get false alarms from moving plants and bushes.4.  Although it can handle 3 zones, I can't find extra detectors anywhere.Overall, I find this to be a useful device in it's role as a motion detector.  Nothing fancy, but does it's job well.  It's a bit on the expensive side and I've yet to be able to locate extra motion sensors.", "Date": "May 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "An intruder alert device, but nothing special", "Author": "Paul E.

But don't screw it back right away, as you have to 1.  select whether you want the device to detect up to 15 feet, or 30 feet, and 2.  you have to pair it with the alarm device.  The alarm device can be plugged in to a power source.  To make this more functional, you will probably need to purchase additional sensor units.  And also, the alarm that goes off when motion is detected is not all that loud, though, so I didn't feel that this was anything special.It is possible to hook it up to your home alarm system.This might be useful if you are worried about intruders entering your property.
