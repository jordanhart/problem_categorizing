Lowes sells a faux sprinkler head for $2.97 (item# 314750). However, I notices an actual plastic sprinkler head cost $1.97. I unscrewed the top of the sprinkler head and slid my key in the space between the spring loaded pop-up head and the outside plastic cylinder. You can fit up to 3-4 keys without a key chain. In addition to the price, the faux sprinkler heads don't look real if you are standing above it.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "good idea, little expensive", "Author": "someone special", "ReviewID": "R3JI7XTO2U5Q9B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pretty good looking sprinkler head - at least enough that it wont warrant a second look, especially when surrounded by grass.  If someone were to take a close look, they would be able to tell its not real (no nozzle), so I wouldn't put it in plain sight.  If you live in a cold climate (since they often don't use in-ground sprinklers) or any other area that doesn't normally have in-ground sprinklers, it may look out of place.  There is a keyring attached to the top so when you unscrew the top, the keys come with it.  Pretty roomy inside too - room for more than just keys.  Looks like it will do the job of keeping out water, soil, and insects.  If you bury it flush with the ground, you will need to clear about 1/2 inch of soil to unscrew the cap. If you leave it sticking up a little, make sure it is hidden by plants, and not going to get hit by a mower.As some other reviewers here said, you can buy this for about $2.50 at lowes.  Also, if you want something even more realistic and less than the price here - just buy an actual sprinkler head, close the bottom with a PVC plug and remove the insides.  The only thing missing would be the keyring, but you could glue one on.  It's kind of wierd that a fake sprinkler head would cost more than a working sprinkler head.", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great product", "Author": "C.

TO solve this problem I realized a hidden spare key was needed but I required one other than a fake rock because, at my household, a rock would stick out like a sore thumb.I spotted the fake sprinkler-head and decided to give it a try.The fake sprinkler head is solid black plastic with a screw off top. The length of the false sprinkler head is several inches meaning it easily is pushed into the ground. Once unscrewed there are two key rings on the lid of the false sprinkler head to hold two separate keys. I keep one copy of my house and one of the mail box that way either my nephew can get inside or, if I am on a trip, I can have someone come over to check in on my house and gather my mail.This is a simple item. What you see is what you get. Does a good job of hiding my keys in plain site. Recommended if you need something different than a rock.", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great keyhider or geocache container", "Author": "Mary", "ReviewID": "R1TYNDPIO2FF7C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this as a geocache container.  So far, the logpages have stayed dry, even though this \"sprinkler\" isn't out of the elements at all.  I would have no qualms about using this as a keyholder either.  It's very realistic looking.  Keeps moisture out and have no features that draw your attention towards it.  It will blend right in and appear to be part of the surrounding landscape (as long as sprinklerheads are a part of the surrounding landscape).", "Date": "October 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Key safe", "Author": "T.

The fake rock had the following downsides:A) Looking out of place. There are no other rocks on our patio.B) While the rock looks and feels realistic, it's clearly too light, and there's clearly plastic on the bottom. If you replace the plastic (to close the rock), it unfortunately pokes out.Therefore, this fake sprinkler head was the best choice. It looks inconspicuous, even in its hidden location, and we feel safe enough to place it outdoors in a secret location.", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very \"cutty\" key holder", "Author": "Judymarin \"marinjudy\"", "ReviewID": "R31J350HLV7M5F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had to buy another for a friend after I showed her.
