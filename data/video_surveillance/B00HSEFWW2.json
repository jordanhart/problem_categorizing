I suggest to locate a fan at the top cover of the Dvr in order to avoid overheating the system and prevent burn, this is not only with this Brand but with most of DVR if its going to be installed in a non AC environment such as the one I installed it.", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00HSEFWW2"}}
