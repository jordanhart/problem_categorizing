{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Seems old school, no HDMI. Bad ad.", "Author": "tuned", "ReviewID": "R8INP8SILJHT5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought Home Depot online $399.99.All info is on a mini CD-ROM. You must have something that can play it or you're outta luck there.Video out is BNC connector so you probably will need the BNC male to RCA female for watching video unless you want to deal with heavy old school VGA monitor cable.Not much for audio input.Ad heralds high quality video. Not really. Face it, is you want decent video (especially at entrance, etc) you need to avoid most cmos cameras. Expect to need at least one upgrade camera. You get what you pay for with cameras.A plus is unit is very compact with no external buttons. If an intruder found it they would still have to have an input device (assuming you hide the input). Not even a power switch. If that was a bother then an external one (power strip) would do. This makes me think it would be a stellar automotive security device. If they steal the whole car then a password becomes moot, but if they don't find it they could be on 'Candid Camera' for the cops after the auto is recovered. Home Depot has been JERKing me around for 2 weeks now by phone and emails after telling me return would be no problem to return it. They say no refund issued until unit arrives at their 'warehouse'. Yet they still have not setup a pick up according to UPS. Just giving me a lot of jive double talk. I have lost all respect for Home Depot Online.12/28/2012:  UPS picked the the unit a couple of days after I posted this review HERE and at the HD page.12/30/2012 Home Depot Online email informs me the same review I placed there has been removed. Email says they do not allow criticism of their 'customer service'.1/2013: Finally got refund, took 3 more weeks. They claim they must have it back in 'warehouse' before a refund is processed.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$599.99", "Features": "Easy-to-use system functions just like a computer; View anytime, anywhere with remote viewing via internet, smartphone, and tablet\nReceive email alerts, with photo, when motion is detected on your property; Record over 2 years' worth of footage on the included 500 GB hard drive\nChoose motion-activated recording or H.264 compression to maximize storage space; 480TVL Hi-res cameras provide crisp and detailed video\n24IR LEDs for 75ft automatic night vision; Weather-resistant camera housing provides superior functioning through all types of weather\nAnti-vandal mount; Easily connect to DVR with 65ft cables", "Name": "Defender Connected 4CH H.265 500BG Smart Security DVR with 4 x 480TVL 75ft Night Vision Indoor/Outdoor Cameras - 21020", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41DOBOjhbAL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008PTMDE4"}}
