For its size, it could have its own internal hard drive storage, but you are limited to a microSD!!  Also the quality of the video was terrible, no audio, and the camera lens is a huge bug eye which alerts suspicion!Do not buy!!!", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$599.00", "Features": "Perfect Hidden Camera for Home Security\nThermal Sensor Activates Built-In DVR and Saves Battery Power\n8 Hours of Continuous Record Time / 100 Hours Standby Time\nInfrared camera Can Capture Action In Very Low Light", "Name": "Recluse Black Box Hidden Camera for Home Security", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31Nksr9P-uL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0080ILL66"}}
