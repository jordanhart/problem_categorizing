{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Lasted a few months and quit", "Author": "cat lover \"cat lover\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZOATOE1LH2SL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is a great product for a reasonable price. The picture is clear, the sound is crisp, and it comes with a variety of doorbells. Would be great if there were controls to allow you to move the camera up and down, but otherwise it's great. It did take a little knowledge of wiring on my husband's part to install... not exactly plug-n-play. But I wasn't expecting that either.All in all, I recommend this product. Once installed, it is very easy to use.Follow-up:They have an insert that promises a free gift if you write a review. Turns out the gift is a warranty extension. Giant pain, requires submission on their website with serial number, link to review, etc. I did all of that, which required taking the screen off the mount, pulling wires loose to find the serial number, clicked submit.... and the form reset. After, of course, my husband had finally gotten the monitor remounted. Frustrating.It is a good product, but their website stinks, which doesn't bode well for future support.Follow-up on January 30, 2012:This product barely lasted 6 months. After 3 - 4 months, the image got fuzzy, now it doesn't work at all. If you live in the desert, this might work for you. But if there's any moisture in the air whatsoever, keep looking. I downgraded this to one star because of it. I'm now in the market for a new one... NOT this brand!", "Date": "June 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Needs vertical camera adjustment", "Author": "McLean, VA", "ReviewID": "R2H5RUVU5N1RBG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We received the system and were impressed by the clarity of the picture and how easy it was to install, however, there are two major issues with this product.  The first is that most doorbells are not at eye-level so to simply replace your doorbell with the camera (which is what is suggested), doesn't work.  The camera has a clip-on on the back to allow you to adjust horizontally but not one vertically so you have to essentially do a full-install instead of working with your two-wire doorbell.  The second issue is that the camera itself is bulky and looks cheap as a doorbell.  It is made of cheap plastic and you'll be suprised as soon as you take it out of the box.  I returned the product once I realize the lack of ability to vertically adjust the camera made it useless.", "Date": "March 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very helpful for persons with limited mobility", "Author": "designmaven", "ReviewID": "R27KHXBOJB42XT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this video/audio doorbell due to my decreasing mobility, as my front door is a half-flight between the two floors in my home. The system is very easy to use - the person at the door just pushes the doorbell, and when I hear the doorbell I just push one button on the screen to activate the camera to see and another button to activate the 2-way intercom to talk.  This enables me to see and speak with the person at the front door before deciding if I want to use my stairlift to go to the front door to let them in.  This has made it much easier for me to stay in my home and maintain my independence and safety.Installing the system is not as easy.  This system includes the outdoor doorbell/speaker unit and the outdoor camera unit as well as the indoor combination speaker/screen.  The outdoor units need to be wired into a power source inside the house, so you will have to drill and wire if these connections are not already in place.  The indoor speaker screen needs to be plugged into a power source.  To connect the outdoor and indoor components there is a single cable containing 2 wires - you have to split open the cable and connect one wire to the doorbell/speaker unit and one to the camera from inside the wall, then you have to run the cable through your home to connect both wires to the indoor screen/intercom unit, so you need to select where you want to locate the indoor screen, as it is tethered to the cable, as well as to the power-source cord.  However, the hard-wire connection provides a reliably clear sound and picture, and the night vision really works well too.  You also need to decide where to position the stationary outdoor camera so you can see children and adults of various heights;  I had mine set a bit high but angled down, so I sometimes have to ask people to step back or closer or left or right and to look up so I can see their face.  I hired an electrician to do all this work, but you may be handy enough to do it yourself.Note:  I also purchased the door-jam unlock component so I could unlock the front door from the indoor speaker/screen;  however, the company that had previously installed my metal front door, including the door frame and lock, declined to install this component, and also informed me that I would lose the door's fire-rating status if anyone cut or otherwise altered any portion of the door or its frame or lock.  I therefore did not install this component, and suggest you confirm if you can use it with your door before you order it.Bottom line, this unit has helped me a lot at a reasonable cost, even with the electrician's charges.  However, it would have been very helpful to have an up-front checklist of the above factors to consider before purchasing it.In the future I may consider a more expensive system with multiple outdoor cameras and a single wireless indoor screen/speaker unit if available, and I would also like to be able to remotely move the outdoor cameras so I could scan wider areas with each camera.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "terrible not working and company doesnt coopearte either amazon we need our money back", "Author": "alex", "ReviewID": "RLA73457V4LT9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "package arrived no problem,we hired an electrician he hard wired the system when it was ready we plugged it in and the monitor doesnt respond keep on ringing the bell and comands dont work.its being 2 weeks no money back they just called from the manufacture telling us to ship the device back and if there is a problem in 4 -6 weeks they will return the money.shame on amazon!!!!we need our money backkkkkkkkk", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worked for less than one month", "Author": "D.
