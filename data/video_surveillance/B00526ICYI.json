{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good, and BAD", "Author": "DSmithSC", "ReviewID": "R11O6TIUCELABV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this monitor because of a friend referral.  I also bought the Summer 3.5 Touch, and the Motorola MBP35 (3.5 screen).  I originally bought the Summer Touch but wasn't 100% sold on it.  That is why i purchased the other two.First off, the good:- Screen Clarity - Seemed better than the Summer and about the same as the Motorola.- Night Vision - This monitor had the best vision at night of all of the monitors.  Everything was much brighter and easier to see. (also listed in the Negatives later).- Battery life - It seemed to get around 5 hours on a charge.  About the same or a tad less than the Summer, but about 2 hours better than the Motorola.- Ability to record and save. - I only played with this feature, but I thought it would be great to have if a nanny or babysitter was over and you could keep track of the actual happenings with your baby. - Neither of the other two monitors had this feature.- Lullaby function - I'm not sure how much this would actually be used, but I thought it was a nice feature to have.  The Motorola also had this.- Night Light - Again, not sure how much it would be used, but another nice feature.  Neither of the other two monitors had this.- VIDEO STAYS ON when off of the charger. - I thought this was a great feature because on the other monitors you have to keep pressing the video button after it automatically times out after about 2 minutes to be able to see the screen and what is going on.  They do this as a power saving feature but it is more aggravating than anything.  The Lorex stays on and makes it easy.- The ability to add other cameras and be able to view them all simultaneously.  The other two monitors allow you to add cameras, but have to view one at a time.  Again, not sure if most parents would ever need this, but it is a nice feature.Now, with the BAD.- No Zoom feature on the Lorex.  Both the Summer and Motorola have this ability.  It has a pretty clear picture, but there are times where I want to zoom in on my child and could not.- No Panning feature on the Lorex.  Both the Summer and Motorola have this.  While this may be ok with some who just want to see a certain area of the crib, or don't mind leaving the camera in a fixed place, it could be an issue for others.  I thought I could easily get past this, but I couldn't.- Audio - When compared to the Summer, you practically had to lay your ear on the back of the monitor (where the speaker is) to be able to hear the child.  The Summer picks up the swing going back and forth, and allows you to adjust the volume to hear much more than the Lorex.- The Talk function. - If you put your mouth right on the microphone, it works ok.  However, testing it with my wife and the Summer, she continuously said the Summer's sound quality on the other end was much better.- Audio Alerts. - a great idea for a feature, but it randomly worked and was more irritating than anything.- The Auto Mute, and Scan features. - While these are great features to have, they did not seem to work.  They randomly chose when to turn on and it usually had to come from a loud noise, but sometimes chose not to even come on then. - And YES, I did adjust the sensitivity on the side.- Skype - while this is a GREAT selling point, it has its flaws.  First, you cannot plug the monitor into a Mac computer to use this feature.  Second, even when plugged into a PC, the video is so far behind and lacking once on Skype, it takes away the usefulness of the feature all together.  Sometimes it would not even show movements that clearly happened.- Inability to connect the monitor to a TV or other video source.  The Summer allows you to connect the monitor to a TV through RCA/mini usb so that you can view it on a larger screen if desired.  The Lorex and Motorola do not.- The Night Vision. - While stated as a positive earlier (which it is), it also has a slight negative.  The LED's on the camera are red and clearly visible at night, whereas the ones for the other monitors are not.  This may bother or alert some children/etc., and may not for others.  It is just a point I thought I should mention.After wanting to love this monitor and replace the Summer with it (already sent the Motorola back due to lack of technical support and inability to plug into another video source), I am afraid I am going to have to send the Lorex back as well.  I wish someone would take the good parts of each of these monitors and combine them, but as of now, they have not.  For now, we are sticking with the Summer monitor because it had the least negatives of all 3.  I think the main reason I wanted something instead of the Summer monitor is because they specialize in baby clothes, products, etc.  Motorola and Lorex specialize in communications and surveillance, therefore I figured there products would be better.  I was mistaken.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Feature Rich Baby Monitor", "Author": "Bayard West \"(Sci-fi novelist)\"", "ReviewID": "R46UPE8G8VVI2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The LW2451 unit just arrived this afternoon, but since there are no reviews as of yet, I thought I would post one so people would have some initial idea of how the system performs.The setup only took a few minutes.  It started beeping right away.  It turns out that it was the alert that the child is making noise.  The loudness of that alert is configurable.  It stopped once I stopped touching the camera.The camera is small, about 4 inches tall.  It pans and tilts, no zoom.  The resolution of the image seems fine.  I did see some noticeable color shifts (hue).  I will try it again in daylight and see if that is still true.  Given how far it tilts, it strikes me that it would work well with a wall mount (bracket not included.)  I placed it on a tall dresser right next to the bed.  Because of that, and my unwillingness to move the bed or dresser, I had to put a small box under the rear to get the 20 degrees I needed.  Someone setting it on a lower table or one just a little further from the bed would not have any issue at all getting a full view of the crib/bed.  The camera has an on/off switch, volume for two-way talk and a sensitivity control for how loud the child must be to set off alerts on the monitor.  The IR LEDs are visible as very dim red lights.  My daughter noticed it, but it did not keep her up.  They are barely visible.The monitor is a convenient size, about the size of a smart phone.  It has dedicated volume buttons.  Button placement seems well thought out.  There is a mini-joystick for pan/tilt/menu nav, press to accept.  The power adapter can be plugged into the cradle or the monitor directly, which appeals to me.  There is a great deal of leeway when setting it in the cradle...  Placement doe not have to be exact for it to charge.  There is a stand so the monitor can sit upright without the cradle.  There is a swing out antenna which does add a bar of reception, but I have not needed it yet.It seems to be playing well with my wireless router, but I would not want to guarantee there is no interference at all until I run a few more speed tests.The camera and monitor are made of the same white plastic that most nursery products are.  It is lighter than it looks, which I know does not alway convey a sense of quality, but it seems solid enough and I would not want them to add weight just for that.Pros:System performs out of the box as advertised.Has features of systems costing a lot more.Night vision works wellSound is clearCradle and charging well thought outTemperature is always visible on monitor and is proving to be accurate.Menus are simple and easy to navigate with thumb controllerReception is greatVolume can be turned all the way of if desired.Video can be turned off if desired.Lots of buttons and functionsCons:Operating pan/tilt or moving through the menus causes beep which may wake spouseSensitivity control for alert that says child is making noise is on the camera, not monitor.Would benefit from a few more configuration options such as turning button beep off.My voice sets off the noise alert when using the two-way talk feature, so I have to wait for the 3 beeps to end before I can hear the person on the other end.  That meeans I miss the first word or two of the reply.No zoom - other units that offer this supposedly get very graining, so I do not care for it.The monitor has been runing for over 4 hours, so the battery performance seems quite good.My experience so far has been excellent.", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Meets and Exceeds Expectations", "Author": "E. Calkins", "ReviewID": "R3Q4HS3FWGLNL8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There is a SERIOUS lack of reviews on this fine product, so I'm writing my first Amazon review to give people more information before they buy.  I would give this a 4.5 because of the few CONS listed below, but since I can't, and there are so many PROS, I'm giving it \"5 Stars\"We received it in the mail today and the camera is MUCH smaller than we thought it would be, which is great because it fits well on the shelf above our daughter's bed.  The monitor is cool, sleek and feature filled...too cool in fact, we had to have a firm talk with our five year son old about playing with the features because it wasn't one of his disposable toys.The last monitor we had was simply a static radio wave audio monitor which had not worked for some time, and with a new baby on the way we needed something.  We had originally purchased the Motorola MBP36 which seemed great, but as a protective dad, I wanted something to watch how the baby sitters handled my two hellions while we were eating Thai Food.  After hours of reviewing iPhone apps, cameras, monitors, etc, this seemed like the perfect fit.  What sold me was the video: easy to use, set up, and was MAC capable.  The camera doesn't have to be plugged into the computer (like some other baby monitors) but the monitor does (which is great because that's when we'd use it as a nanny cam).With regards to the first review, you CAN actually turn the beeping of the buttons on the monitor down by turning down the Alarm Sound.  So now my five year old and I can geek out swinging the camera around while not waking up the rest of the family.  I wish the camera could be controlled from our iPhones, but as an engineer and a pilot, I think this product is overall pretty sleek.  Here's the breakdown:PROs:- Pan/Tilt all around the room- Auto IR night cam (no need to turn it on like some other cams)- Good quality video day/night (unlike other cams.  Example footage from the Amazon product video is accurate)- Intuitive monitor and simple controls (My five year old gets it)- Camera Skype account was easy to set up with set-by-step directions- No white noise when monitoring.  Just comes on when the kiddo starts cranking.-Nifty features:  - Talk through monitor (to sooth baby or freak out the dog...both work great!)  - Musical soothing tunes  - Skype dial up for mom & dad, or aunts, uncles, grand parents...but they can't see inside your house unless you hook in the monitor and turn on Skype.  - Record onto a mini-SD. Don't have one, but neat.  - Expandable to four cameras, can be the LW2400 ($50-$70) or LW2451 ($91-$150) - prices from Amazon, any other cameras?  - See all four cameras at once (control them one at a time if needed!).  - Auto-sound detection so you don't hear static while you're trying to sleep.  - Temperature monitor and alarms  - Timer alarms, if you need it.  - Extendable monitor antenna to walk down and get the mail.CONs:- Green light is always on the camera (nothing a little electrical tape can't handle)- Auto-sound detection sensitivity is on the camera, not the monitor- Musical tunes rhythm is a little quick, and songs change automatically which is a bummer- Lack of zoom- Lack of tilt/pan through Skype (obviously.  Hopefully Lorex will push a native app as a software update)- 3 Steps to view on Skype as Nanny Cam (not bad, but if you do these out of order, and open Skype first, the Skype camera defaults to the iSight and you have to go back into PREFERENCES and re-select the Lorex camera):  1)  Plug in Monitor  2) Then open Skype to that account  3) Call the Lorex Skype account your set up to viewAgain, I understand the third party app requires help, but I think code could easily be added so that Skype automatically opens when the computer detects the monitor and closes down when the monitor is disconnected.However, these may be considered Nit-Noid CONs to some, and, in fact, they are small potatoes, but some factoids that some may find interesting.

Picture quality is great even in the low to no light area.Sound quality was a bit tricky to figure out though.  After reading the reviews about the monitor being way too low to actually monitor anything I was skeptical about the purchase.  After playing with the sensitivity dial found out that it is a little counter intuitive, the larger the sensitivity the louder the noise has to be to break the threshold to transmit sound.  Once I put the sensitivity dial to the lowest setting the sound quality was out of this world.If you are having problems with sound check the sensitivity dial on the camera and make sure it isn't turned up too high.", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worth the Money!", "Author": "Wendy Moody \"wendyrashelle\"", "ReviewID": "R3S6SGK2IA6BXI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the first year we used the Sony Baby Call Baby Monitor - 900MHZ which worked well but decided to upgrade to a video monitor when we learned we were having our second baby. We've been using this Lorex video monitor for a couple of months now and we love it. It leaves nothing to the imagination. You know exactly how your child is sleeping. The video is very crisp in daytime and the night view is impressively detailed considering its subtle non-intrusive red lights. We use a cool mist humidifier as noise maker in our daughters room and it does not cause noticeable interference. The set up was pretty simple and everything connected without any hassles. We haven't tried connecting to the monitor via the internet yet. Overall I love this product after buying it the very first day it became available. I am planning on buying more cameras to take advantage of the 4 channel availability.UPDATE: Jan 2013We have been using this for over a year now and we still love it. The battery is sufficient to carry around during the day and leave on the charger by our bed at night. We don't use the talk back feature hardly at all but it works well. The signal is strong enough to go outside and do yard work without any problem.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "So much more than a \"baby\" monitor!!!", "Author": "Gadgetgal", "ReviewID": "RPMOKWLP7A78D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't even have a baby -- what I do have is a teen and a tween.  I also have a finished basement where my kids hang out and I like to monitor what goes on down there.  I can clearly hear and view from 3 floors up!  The clarity is superb, the features are great.  As the description states, you can hook this up to skype so you can even see what's going on if you are not even home.  So when my teen is babysitting, I can see what's going on from my iphone via skype!  How cool is that?!  There is also a \"talk\" button so if you choose, you can use it as an intercom system.  I have been playing around with it and so far, I'm super impressed with what this can do.  If you have any place in your home you want to monitor, this is the item.  This is not just a \"baby monitor\", it's an in-home surveillance system and can even give you peace of mind when you aren't home.  I would think this would be a great item to keep an eye on a puppy as well.  Highly recommend.

Colin McGraw \"AV, Computer & EnviroTech Nut\"", "ReviewID": "R17HDAV3OZ9OC3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have five young kids split between two rooms in our house and I pretty much think this video monitor set is the bomb. First, there are two cameras that you can switch between after everything is set up. For us, that means we can monitor all our kids with a single baby monitor screen for the first time!More importantly, however, is the fact that the viewing unit has a joystick to let you control the side-to-side and up-and-down direction of one of the cameras. This is AWESOME for us, because our kids would often sneak outside of the viewing area of the monitors we used in the past, but now we can search them out via the joystick and see what kind of trouble they're getting into.On the downside, these monitors have a limitation in two-way communication; it takes a few seconds after speaking before you can hear what's going on near the camera. Consequently, it's hard to have a back-and-forth conversation with the toddlers you keep reminding to stay in bed.Also, I was hoping the Skype functionality worked over WiFi or something to enable remote viewing, but it turns out you need to hook the camera up to a computer. Sadly, this limits where you can put the camera if you want to use that feature and it's a bit of a waste of electricity to have to leave the computer on.Despite the drawbacks, I think it's a pretty great set of monitors overall!", "Date": "November 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Comparison to Summer Baby Touch", "Author": "Twins Fan", "ReviewID": "R354C31D86K68T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Based on my research, it seems the two best monitors at this time are the Lorex Live Sense with pan/tilt and the Summer Baby Touch. I tried them both and ultimately chose the Lorex. The bottom line is Lorex has a voice (or cry) activated system in their monitors that helps me sleep much better. The monitor only turns itself on when it senses noise above a certain decibel. You can set the sensitivity of this to your comfort level. I wake in an instant for all the grunts, coughs, and resettling noises my kids make so standard monitors are essentially worthless. In addition, I don't like having the screen on all night because it wakes me...yes I'm a little high maintenance when it comes to sleep. When it turns on you can choose to have picture, sound, or both. I keep the sound off for my husband because just the screen turning on wakes me up. So....this feature is what makes the video monitor worth it for me or I probably wouldn't be able to use a monitor at night at all or I'd be a zombie.Another reviewer mentioned that their Lorex parent unit beeped when they were using the pan/tilt feature which concerned me. My unit does NOT do this so maybe they fixed that glitch.I like the buttons and layout of the Lorex better and like the voice activated system of the Lorex, but everything else is better on the Summer. The camera movement of the Summer is virtually silent and the power light is more discreet than the Lorex. That said, my kids didn't seem to notice the light motor noise of the Lorex camera moving. The summer units (both parent unit and cameras) seem more sturdy and better constructed. The Summer's kickstand is way better, more sturdy. My only big complaint with the Summer, aside from not having the voice activated feature, is all the screen tapping I had to do to switch cameras from one kid to the other. It's pretty tough to do in the middle of the night and had me praying I liked the Lorex better. Thankfully the Lorex just has a button on the side to toggle between cameras. The temperature monitor with the Lorex is pretty nice, but not a make it/break it for me. I mounted the lorex units on the wall with 3M mounting strips without a problem. Each camera is about a 1/2 lb.Finally, the Lorex has a power light on the parent unit that is REALLY bright. It does not face the front thankfully, but I plan to cover it with electrical tape because it lit up the wall next to my bed. Both units have lights on the front to indicate how much noise it is sensing. The Summer lights are a bit brighter and would probably bug me :).Interesting differences: The Lorex has the time right on the screen, but no battery indicator. It just alerts you when you're getting low. On battery power, the Lorex will allow you to keep the screen on until it dies while the Summer will not. It turns off after maybe 10 seconds and you have to hit the screen or a button to turn it back on. Battery and reception seem good on both. The Lorex has a little antenna you can pop up if needed. I had reception in my neighbor's yard across the street with the Lorex (didn't try with the Summer). I'm buying this to replace my Lorex Snap and both of these units are leaps above that one in reception, construction, and ease of use.If you're a sensitive sleeper, the Lorex is great. If you tolerate having a monitor on all night long and don't mind lots of screen tapping to switch cameras, then I'd go with the Summer.", "Date": "November 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worked Once", "Author": "Azrith", "ReviewID": "R21KXNOYP94Q2K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this planning on using it for our newborn. I used it once then had it shelved for two months as our baby was sleeping in the same room. I decided to move it to another location to get some use out of it and now the monitor doesn't turn on. Pretty disappointing.If you buy one, make sure to test it thoroughly so that if it breaks after limited use you can simply return it to Amazon.Update - 4/13/2013After contact the manufacturer I sent the monitor back and received a replacement. The replacement is currently working. The range on the WiFi is great as I'm able to view the camera through our two story home. The return process is somewhat of a pain though as you have to register on their website, submit a ticket, submit supporting paperwork on the purchase, and then we randomly received a replacement with no information on sending back the defective one.

Hill", "ReviewID": "R2NFWV5MUFZOK7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The kit includes a rather hefty printed instruction manual, a small, approximately three and a half inches measured diagonally, video monitor, two color cameras, AC adapters, mounting hardware, USB cable, and a 1 GB memory module. Installation is simple -- put the cameras where you want them, plug them in and turn them on. Then, plug the monitor in and turn it on. The cameras are pre-configured (paired) and appear instantly on the monitor.Two different camera models came with the set, one LW2400 series and one LW2450 series. Both units have microphones, speakers, and temperature sensors. The LW2400 has a night light, while the LW2450 has pan and tilt capability, which allows adjusting the view side to side and up and down using the joystick on the monitor.The LW2400 can also be powered using AA batteries or an optional rechargeable battery pack. Both cameras have light sensors which activate night vision in low light situations. Neither camera has a zoom feature, instead a fixed focal length is utilized that makes all items appear in focus. Items in a range from ten to fifty feet away appear sharp.The monitor's LCD screen has a relatively high resolution image with good color. There are two lines of information at the top, with the first line beginning at the left with blue bars indicating the signal strength of the selected camera, followed by bright yellow text indicating one of four possible camera channels, followed by the temperature.If the overwrite function has been enabled for continuous recording, lighted \"OW\" initials appear in green on the right. The second line starts at the left with an icon indicating if a microSD memory card has been inserted, followed by an icon indicating if recordings are present (yellow) or if the memory device is full (red).According to the instruction manual the included 1 GB memory card will record one hour and forty-five minutes of activity with movement, or two hours and fifty minutes of an empty room. If greater recording capacity is desired up to a 32 GB memory card may be used (not included) and will record almost 58 hours with movement or almost eighty-nine and a half hours with no movement. The date and time are displayed at the bottom of the screen.Pressing the \"Cam\" button on the side of the monitor switches between the two cameras or pressing the \"Seq\" button shows all of the paired cameras at once, dividing the screen into quarters. The unit has the capacity to add an additional two cameras for a total of four, but whether two are attached or four, the screen divides into quarters. Needless to say, in this configuration, the pictures on the monitor are very small. The scan mode shows each active camera for 6 seconds then switches to the next one. There is also a scan mode that only activates the video screen when a camera microphone hears a noise.I placed the monitor in the kitchen, with one camera in the furthest bedroom, about 40 feet away, and the adjustable camera on a windowsill in the garage to watch the driveway, about 20 feet away from the monitor. Both cameras connected instantly and provided a steady picture without interruption. Whenever a fairly loud noise occurs in the proximity of either camera (such as a door closing or a loud vehicle passing,) the monitor beeps 3 times.The monitor has a rechargeable lithium battery that charges either by plugging in the AC adapter directly or through the supplied cradle that serves as a stand for the monitor. On the front of the unit, there is a button to turn off the video without stopping the monitoring function. There is also a menu button to adjust settings and a joystick to pan and scan the camera, as well as negotiate the menuPlus and minus volume buttons and a push to talk button complete the front controls.In addition to the camera controls previously mentioned, there are buttons to play pre-recorded nursery rhyme-style music from the cameras if being used as a baby monitor, an on/off switch, antennae unlock, and automatic and manual recording switches. There are ports for the memory card and a USB cable.I followed the instructions for installing the USB driver software on my PC to enable the monitor to be viewed through Skype (Microsoft's Internet technology for making video phone calls.) First, put the supplied CD/DVD in the PC and click the USB install button on the menu. This copies a program to the desktop, which when run, installs the USB drivers. Plug the cable into the camera monitor, then into the PC. At this point, Windows is supposed to automatically detect the device, but it did not on my computer. Every time I plugged the cable into the PC I got the message \"USB device not recognized\", so I gave up on that computer.I tried another computer and was finally able to get it to recognize the monitor after 30 minutes of plugging and unplugging the cable. This was a Windows 7 computer, while the one that would not recognize the device was running Windows 8 Pro. Again, the only reason listed for connecting the monitor to the PC is to use it to remotely monitor the device by using Skype.It was not easy to set-up the Skype connection. An account is required for yourself and the monitor, and then the two must be connected. Also, you cannot switch between cameras through Skype, so the monitor must have only one camera selected. Obviously, if the user only owns one computer and takes it with them when they leave the house there is no way to make the Skype connection.When I finished connecting the monitor to my PC so I could, at some point, connect to Skype, I looked at the monitor in the charging cradle and noticed that one of the cameras was no longer working even though I wasn't actively using Skype. I checked both cameras to be sure they were plugged-in and the green lights were on, which they were. However, camera two was no longer in view on the monitor. After investigating I realized the camera lost its pairing and had to be re-paired, a tedious process involving the use of a paper clip to depress the recessed pairing button.I use the system to monitor the cameras while at home, or to record when I'm away, so the Skype aspect isn't an issue for me. And, after several months I am pleased with the dependability of the unit. There have been no performance issues or other problems.", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent monitor, Highly recommended", "Author": "LANAVJ", "ReviewID": "R1AT0MNVZXVP1S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works great.

Audio, there is some static noise in the back ground which can be annoying if there is no other sound in the room you are in.  It can be reduced by lowering sensitivity on the camera and lowering volume on the receiver, but that also reduces the ability to pick up sounds of the baby on the receiver.2. Two way communication. There is a few seconds time lab after you press the talk button before the receiver transmits what you are saying. Be sure to wait a few seconds after you press the talk button and then talk for two way communication.3. Skype. The camera has to be connected to a computer all the time. I am not sure if the computer will \"wake up\" if in sleep mode when you call using skype, but it works and the camera resolution for skype is pretty good.I would have given it 4 stars for some of the minor issues I mentioned above, but gave a five to make up for some of the 1 stars given by people who got defective units.

The video quality is excellent- even in complete darkness!! It shows the temperature and seems to be very accurate. I love the talk back feature and my son thinks I am in the camera and waves and says hi to me every time he sees it (even if I am in his bedroom with him!) =). I wish the camera could pan...that is the only major drawback to me...It seems like all new video monitors on the market right now can pan and zoom so I don't know why Lorex didn't include this (Maybe so they can make an upgrade in a year and make more money???). Also, I do agree with other reviewers that the battery life on the monitor is not the best. I get 3, maybe 4, hours out of it. But, I think that's the case with most monitors. The Skype feature works great and is so neat. My husband's family lives in Florida and they're able to see my son while he sleeps. Very cool. One feature that I absolutely LOVE about this monitor is that I can turn the \"scan\" feature on and during the night the monitor will be on but will be completely black and silent(so it doesn't bother us while we sleep). Then, if my son cries or makes a loud noise in the room, the monitor will pop on and the sound will come on and stay on for however long the sound lasts and then go off again. GREAT feature!! I know other mamas who have baby monitors that they have to leave on all night because there is no \"scan\" feature. Now that would be annoying. I like my peace and quiet until my baby cries! You can also set the sensitivity on the camera to be low or high so if you only want your monitor to come on when you child screams bloody murder....or if you want it to come on when they let out a little moan...you can set it to what you want. Love that! The main reason we chose this monitor over others is that we are adding baby #2 to the family in June and we wanted a monitor that would allow us to watch both babies at the same time. Lorex is the only monitor on the market that has the sequence \"quad\" mode that allows you to view up to four cameras on the screen at once! Or you can choose to have it automatically scan through the cameras one at a time. Also, back to the monitors ability to be dark and silent in the night and only come on when the baby cries...you can do that with two cameras too. You can have them both set to \"scan\" mode and then when one of your babies cries the monitor will pop on and show the camera of the baby who is crying. Love it! The only reason I give it four stars is because it lacks the pan and zoom....but the other features I mentioned are much more important to me and out way the lack of pan and zoom.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Three monitors reviewed and compared, you decide.", "Author": "Andrea M.", "ReviewID": "R1TDGLW6E6QQH0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought three monitors, no one is \"the perfect one\", some are good for the price, some are better than others because of the dimension of your home or the type of WiFi you're using. I think the best one (that I haven't tested yet) is the Motorola MBP36 but it sells for $239.Here some pros and cons of the ones I've tested: Lorex LW2451Pros:- Very good video quality- Very good infrared/night video quality- Very good video FPS (frames per second), very fluid video (like a professional security camera)- 3.5\" monitor- Charging Docking Station. The battery life is really good because you don't really think about it, when it sits on the station it's always charging (this is a big plus)- PTZ- Button to turn ON and OFF whenever you like to- Good and simple options menu- Good options- microSD for video recording- Video recording with button- Video recording with voice activation- Very good price- No interference with the WiFi (2.4Ghz or 5Ghz)- It works as webcam for Skype when connected to the PC via USB (I hoped it worked wirelessly as well but it doesn't, it's a big plus anyway. Extremely easy installation)Cons:- SOUND TOO LOW (best monitor I've had but this is a deal breaker. NOT SAFE! Wait for new model, hopefully they will change the microphone)- Voice activation (VOX) not working very well (since the microphone is not the best, sometimes you need too much noise and you can hear the baby from the room before than through the monitor)- Not too long power cable. Hard to mount high points on wall Infant Optics DXR-5Pros:- Very good price for the options you get- Good video quality- Very good infrared/night video quality- Good video FPS (frames per second), fluid video- Best voice activation (VOX) I've tried. This can also be annoying since it will turn on on every little movement during the night but I like to see the baby is safe every time he moves or every time he makes a noise, I really like this feature.- Best noise isolation I've tried- Extremely simple options (4 buttons total, very well explained)- Stand included (even if not needed in my opinion, the monitor is alreay designed to stand by itself)- Clip (my wife liked this, she was able to go outside with the monitor on her jeans all the time)Cons:- Awful battery life (constantly in charge)- No button to turn the video ON whenever you like to- It doesn't turn ON on VOX (someone may like this better?). It turns ON on \"always ON\"- It literally kills your WiFi (this was my deal breaker with this monitor). I own an IT company and I install WiFi networks for companies, there was no way to get this to work with any channel and any router (I now have one of the best WiFi N900 routers installed, the ASUS RT-N66U). If you use 5Ghz band you will be fine but not every device has this possibility. I had to literally shut the monitor down to stream HD movies to my Boxee Box (no 5Ghz available on the Boxee Box), also unable to transfer files between laptops or iPhone- Not too long power cable. Hard to mount high points on wall Motorola MBP33Pros:- Very good video quality- Very good infrared/night video quality- Good video FPS (frames per second), fluid video (better than the DXR-5 but worse than the LW2451)- Amazing microphone, it is actually an external microphone like the ones you buy for computers, it also seem you get stereo audio from it. Just for this kind of microphone, the MBP33 is the safest monitor I've tested- No interference with the WiFi (2.4Ghz or 5Ghz)- When it goes off idleing, you can turn it on pressing any button. If you hurry when you hear something just press a button and look (awesome function)- Long power cable- It doesn't isolate the static noise of the room (the DXR-5 is the best for that) (changing this to a Pro feature. If you hear static you always know the monitor works and it's capturing audio also you can hear your son breathe.Cons:- No Pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) (you get that with $60 more, with the MBP36. I don't think this option and the VOX are worth $60)- No voice activation (VOX)UPDATE:The MBP33 stopped working about two weeks ago (we were oversea for vacation!), it lasted long time and speakers just break. I've opened it, tried to solder the speaker again, made a mess and Motorola didn't even blink. They, with Amazon, refunded me right away, no questions.I am ordering a new one, same model, right now and change the rating to 5 stars. The Motorola MBPxx It's the best monitor I've tested so far.", "Date": "October 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not bad but could be better", "Author": "Mancari", "ReviewID": "R3UVK7WNQ32NYB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We just received received this monitor today. We bought it to replace our Summer Infant Complete Coverage Color Video Monitor Set with 7\" LCD Screen and 1.8\" Handheld Unit. We have had the Summer Infant for about 3 years now. The main screen started going out so we decided to try something new. The thing we loved about the Summer Infant was the fact it came with 2 monitors (not cameras but the screen to watch the camera). This is important to us because we have the large one in our master bedroom and use the smaller one for babysitters (who stay the night when we are at work). When we get home from work we like to be able to still have the monitor in our room so we can check on our little guy. No other monitors seem to have this so we had to figure something else out. What lead us to this was the ability to view the cameras from Skype. Sounded like a great idea but here is the problem. The monitor must stay hooked to the computer in order to view it remotely. In my opinion it kind of defeats the purpose on why we purchased it. Set up is pretty straight forward pairing the cameras to the monitor and I love the ability to pan and rotate the camera. We also purchased an additional camera that we put in our upstairs loft. The quality of the picture seems to be good and the interference is much better than the Summer Infant was. Not sure if we are going to be able to keep this one because of the remote viewing issue. For anyone that this isn't important to you should love this monitor and I would recommend it.

And in a few months, we will use it to monitor his new born brother.1. The  day video is superb. Some people complain that the color isn't vibrant. Although it is true that colors in the day do not show up well, this isn't an issue for me because I use this as a baby monitor, not survalliance. I don't need to distinguish colors.2. Night vision is fantastic. This was the most important feature for me because I am anticipating using this to watch our infant sleeping and I am comforted to know that at night I will see him as clear as a bell.3. Others have complained about the sound. I have no issues with the sound quality. I read nearly all the reviews for this product before I bought it. And if you read on, you find that the sensitivity setting on the camera works opposite than assumed...with the higher sensitivity creating lesser sound and vice versa. So I just set it accordingly, and no problems.4. The talk back mode is great and I use it to answer my son while he is in his room. The volume for that function is on the camera. I had it set too high too begin with, so it frightened him. But after adjusted, it isn't my voice of \"GOD\" booming at him anymore and he than recognized me.5. The music feature works. I don't use it.6. The monitor is very easy to use. You don't even have to read the manual to work it. The picture is clear. We have three cameras hooked up to it and I love that I can view three in quad mode or each individually. I also like that I can recieve sound for all in quad mode. The monitor is light weight and small enough to carry around.7. The temperature gage is wonderful. We live in an older home. Ours sons playroom has a western facing exterior wall and can get quite cool in there. It is nice to be able to confirm the temp. It seems accurate. I haven't brought in another temp gage, but when the temp indicates comfortable tempratures, it feels comfortable in the there.8. It is still winter here, so I can't attest to the range of this unit yet. I will update when we get back to outdoor living. We are on a farm so we are outside a lot. I hope it lives up to my expectations on that.9. It doesn't interfere with our wifi AT ALL that I can tell, which is a plus being we have satellite Internet to begin with and that can be slow sometimes. It was nice that it didn't interfere.Edit:Now that we had a few nice days here before spring disappeared to be replaced by a second winter....Argh...but enough of that. I walked a thousand feet, Atleast, into our field, and even with the camera being on the opposite side of the house from where I was..i could still pick up a signal. Granted, it flipped in and out. But this was just a test to max out the range. The actual reality of our use will be within a 500~700 got range. I was truly impressed that I was able to walk down to our shed ( sits about 500 feet from the house) and not only get great reception, but I could be inside the insulated shed and still receive a clear signal. Ooh happy days! We couldn't even get a sound signal from our Graco audio monitot in there when our son was young.

Unequivocally. And we've had several - most of which were terrible. This is the first Lorex product I've ever had and I was SO happy to see how much better of a product it was than the others i've owned, in almost every way.The video quality is vastly superior to my previous systems - i can ACTUALLY SEE my baby's EYES in the dark! I've never been able to do that with other systems! The audio quality is great as well, both with picking up audio AND with broadcasting audio out of the camera. When i would talk through our old camera it TERRIFIED my kids because of how garbled my voice sounded, but the Lorex camera make my voice much more true-to-life. Additionally, the cameras and handheld viewing device are so sleek and cool looking, not clunky and obvious like my previous systems, that my kids often mistake it for my phone.One of the cameras in this set has the ability to pan left to right and up and down - let me tell you this feature is AWESOME. SUPERB! How did we ever live without it?? Especially when checking in on a room with a sleeping 5 and 2 year old, it's so cool to be able to scan the room and see BOTH kids!Now, after all that glowing talk of the Lorex system, I DO have some minor complaints, they are all about the design, though, not the performance. Which again, is a HUGE step up from all previous monitoring systems I've used.1) The camera that pans does not go DOWN very much. It tilts UP a WHOLE LOT... but down? Nope. Generally when you're using a monitor camera you have to mount it UP HIGH on the wall... which means you need it to be able to look down low. We've had a lot of trouble getting ours mounted just right so that we can see the lower parts of the room that this camera is in.2) It's difficult to get the viewing device back in the charger. It might not seem like a big deal, but at 2am it's NOT fun to be fumbling around in the dark, cursing and waking up your partner, and eventually turning on a light just to get the stupid thing plugged back in.3) The lowest setting for brightness is SO BRIGHT! This has been an issue with EVERY video monitor I've ever owned. PLEASE, SOMEONE TEST THESE THINGS IN THE DARK before you send them out on the market! When you're trying to look at the monitor in the dark after having been asleep for a few hours the screen on this thing is tortuously bright!4) The buttons. Oh, lordy the buttons. Again, please test these things IN THE DARK before you sell them, guys!! There are SO MANY buttons on the viewing device and NOT A ONE OF THEM is discernible in the dark. You simply have to MEMORIZE what buttons are where. Heaven forbid you accidentally hit the PLAY MUSIC button when you're simply trying to switch cameras! AHH! Disaster! Also, many of the buttons are on the SIDES of the device which makes it difficult to hold without bumping one, and even more difficult to get it back in the charger without hitting one.Needless to say, the performance of this system is TOP NOTCH. But the design (mostly of the viewing device) needs quite a bit more work. But overall, it's still the best system we've owned and will probably be the LAST one we ever own. It's excellent!", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great but the remote viewing lets it down. Uses Skype.", "Author": "CP30 \"CP30\"", "ReviewID": "R1VBL3MSU76PO2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this during the Black Friday sales and got it for $99.  It arrived within the week and as always with Amazon was well packaged.I don't think I need to list what's in the box but you do get a 1GB micro SD card which was nice.  You can record up to 1.5hrs.  I've replaced that with a 4GB card to I now get 7.5hrs.First, I don't have a baby.  I have a teenager.  I bought this so I could keep an eye on my house while I'm at work by using the remote view. More on that below.The camera and monitor are of good quality.  Sturdy and well made.  They can both run on batteries or they can run on the power adapters that you receive.  The camera not only records picture and sound but picks up on the room temprature and has infared capability for night vision.  The basics - you plug in the camera and switch it on.  You plug in the monitor and switch it on, the monitor will scan for cameras and within seconds you get the image on the screen.  That's it, it's that easy.  I have the camera in the living room and the monitor in my room.  There are 3 walls between both and the signal strength is still at maximum and the picture quality is excellent.  It does appear in B/W though with just a hint of color...if you know what I mean.  The colors are not rich but that's not important. Like other reviews, the sound that is picked up and heard on the monitor is very low, hard to hear.  You can set the recording mode to 30 seconds...so when the camera picks up sound it will record for upto 30 seconds.  That's enough for me...and you can set it to over-write so when the SD card is full it will start over again.Remote view.  Works through Skype.  Most of us have Skype accounts, if not you will need to open 2.  You need 1 account for you and 1 account for the camera.  The instruction booklet is very easy to follow when setting this up either for PC or MAC.  Once you have both accounts set up on Skype you basically befriend eachother and adjust a couple of settings but it's all in the book.  Now, here's the problem. The monitor, which obviously picks up the picture, needs to be connected to the internet... then you can use you smart phone to gain remote access.  I was hoping you just connected the monitor to your modem or router but you can't.  YOU HAVE TO CONNECT THE MONITOR TO A LAPTOP AND HAVE SKYPE OPEN AND RUNNING.  Now, for my purposes, I can not have my laptop set up and hidden in a closet, well I could but it would be a pain.  I did try it and it works fine.  Using my cell phone I can access the camera and see my living room perfectly but coming home everyday and moving the laptop etc is too much hassle.There must be wifi cameras out there.  You put the camera in your house, it sends a signal to your modem/router and then you can access it via a smart phone.  If anyone know of any like this, please let me know!!!I'm happy with the purchase.  For $99 its a good quality camera and monitor and will record images while I'm not home and help me keep an eye on my house/teenager.  Using the remote view would be awesome but having a laptop constantly set up is just a pain.  I could just leave my laptop on the kitchen table and point the webcam towards the living for that!  The remote viewing on this device doesn't make sense to me... if you see a way around this please let me know.Thx", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing picture, easy set up!  Highly recommend!", "Author": "SMB", "ReviewID": "R8V92XKN74DB3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update 12/18/2012 to add:  We noticed that the monitor reports a temp that is about 6 degrees above the actual temp.  Not bad at all since this is a notorious inaccuracy issue with monitors.We have a finicky individual room controlled heat system, I bought a wireless temperature (weather station wireless thermostat, found through Amazon)  that came with a stick that is intended to go outside so that you can view the temp on the monitor inside + humidity and indoor temp etc.  I instead put the stick in my daughters room.  This way, at night I can monitor the temp in her room with the door closed and without disturbing her, which is how we noticed the degree difference.BTW: my husband and I agree, this monitor is amazing - we use it constantly - for naps, at night, you name it.  My daughter is thick into teething (it is so painful to be little!) and we can watch her to see when she gets sick, or looks especially distressed verses normal waking up alone crying.  I would happily purchase this monitor for a family member without question. However, if you're looking for a cliff notes suggestion: buy only the monitor + pan/tilt camera.  (We almost never use the stationary one.)---This review is on the Lorex Wireless Video Home Monitor with two cameras (wireless camera & pan/tilt camera).The monitor came in two boxes, the actual monitor and wireless (stationary) camera in one well packaged retail box and the pan/tilt in a small plain white box.Set-up was super easy.  Plug everything in, and turn on the monitor.  I turned the pan/tilt camera on first so it paired with the monitor without me having to do anything.  When I went to test the second camera, I had to hold the \"pair\" button and pair it with the monitor.Menu - Pairing - pick channel (different from other camera - if you accidentally chose the same channel it'll boot the other camera and then you'll have to pair that one) - it then counts down 30 seconds while requesting you hit the pair button on the camera.  The pair button on the stationary camera is on the botton of the camera head, in the back. That was it.  Easy.Note: Pairing the pan/tilt camera requires a bobby pin or something small to push the button, so I suggest make the pan/tilt the first one you set up and then manually pair the second camera)Both cameras were easily viewed on the monitor at the same time. You just need to click the second button on the right hand side of the monitor (seq). You can switch between monitors and view them individually by clicking \"video\" which is the first button located on the side of the camera.Pan/Tilt Camera:  Impressive.  I love this thing.  My previous baby monitor was stationary and basic.  This is awesome.  It has a great range of motion and it is set to view the crib from above.  You move it using the mini-joystick on the monitor.  I can move it to see the entire crib, and the surrounding area easily.  NOTE:  It does make a little bit of noise when it moves.  It is not too loud, but my daughter (15 months) has looked straight at the camera when we've moved it so we try to position it before she goes in the crib and move it after she's asleep.Picture Quality:  The pan/tilt camera is FAR superior in terms of picture quality.  The picture is crisp and clear - even in the dark.  The stationary camera is okay, but appears a bit grainy in the dark.  No complaints on quality but ultimately I do almost primarily use the pan/tilt camera.Music:  We use a Graco sound machine, so we do not use this feature.  However, when testing it - it came through loud and clear.  You turn the music on by a button on the left hand side of the monitor.  You can turn the music on BOTH cameras at the same time.  You just need to view each camera individually and turn it on.  To turn it off, same thing.  There are four songs: Brahms, Hush Little Baby, Rokabye (sic), Twinkle.  It cycles through each song when turned on.  You adjust the volume on the cameras.  You'll want to make sure this is at a desirable level before you turn it on - they can be pretty loud.  On the monitor you can turn the volume up so you can hear what is playing.Talk Feature:  Same as with the music, if you're using both cameras you can talk through each camera by being on the individual screen.  You can't talk through both monitors if you're viewing them both.  The pan/tilt camera sounds great, the stationary camera is not.  The stationary camera has bad feedback despite me testing it 15+ feet away.Recording: My monitor came with a 1GB micro-memory card.  I put it in, and hit record.  It gives you two options: File Overwrite and Audio trigger.  On audio trigger you can set it in increments of 5-15-30 seconds to begin recording after the audio is triggered.  That could be very useful in the future.  I tested it to trigger at 5 seconds and it worked as intended.Theres a series of options you can click through under settings, setting the time/date, temperature (and warnings at set temps), brightness, alarm volume, timer, etc.Overall, I really really like this camera.  I would like it more if the pan/tilt camera came with a wall mounting bracket or holes so you could mount it.  It doesn't and apparently you have to purchase the bracket separately.*see tip at bottom*  I would also like it if the tilt/pan camera zoomed.  Maybe next model.  I love how I can turn the sound off on the monitor - I can watch, but don't need to listen.  My old monitor made you listen by refusing to turn off the sound.Overall, I highly recommend this monitor.  I also recommend forgoing the stationary camera unless you need two cameras and instead just going with the option that includes the monitor and the pan/tilt camera.Any questions?  Feel free to leave a comment!TIP: Put a piece of packing tape down, folding the corner so you can pull it up later easily on the base of the camera.  Then use some strong velcro to stick it wherever you want it to go.

The first one, I broke by carrying around and subsequently dropping. The second one, my babysitter broke and I don't know how. The 3rd AND 4th one - the monitor charger parts broke off entirely too easily. However, Lorex has finally done a decent job. The biggest tip I can give anyone interested in this monitor is DO NOT carry it around or leave it where it might get knocked. It's sensitive and extremely breakable, like carting around a tiny LCD TV.Please don't take my long \"con\" list the wrong way, I do LOVE this system!! I just like to be thorough.Pros: 1) It worked right out of the box. 2) I can see my daughter when I need to without having to enter her room and risk her seeing me, provoking a \"momma momma\" screaming fit. 3) There are no weird parts on the charger that will break off. 4) It gives me her room temperature. 5) Night vision is great. 6) It wakes me up when she wakes up in the middle of the night. 7) It tells me when the battery is low. 8) It tells me when the signal is low. 9) It's fun to play with the \"talk\" button and watch her try to figure out how she can hear me although I'm not there. 10) It gives me peace of mind when I wake up at 2 am and want to look to see if she is still in bed. 12) Pretty great picture.Cons: 1) The charging base is very small, it does not encase the base of the monitor - I hope it doesn't get knocked down. 2) The video monitor screen is small, but bigger than the old Lorex systems. 3) It takes a while to get use to the \"alarm\" beeping when the camera detects movement or noise, but if you take time to adjust the camera sensitivity, it's much better. 4) It doesn't work from far away, but my house is small so it's a non-issue for me - if you have a 3,000 sq ft house you may not get good reception. 5) Old Lorex cameras will not work with the system, you must purchase Live Sense cameras. 6) It started beeping every 60 seconds and was driving me bananas, there were no troubleshooting tips and I was ready to return it within 24 hours. In frustration, I pushed buttons on the side of the monitor and it suddenly stopped. 7) The Skype & iPhone feature isn't very good. You only get a partial & grainy view, plus you need 2 skype accounts to make it work. Not very intuitive. 8) Learn very well where the buttons are - so you don't accidentally press the button which blasts Brahms Lullaby through the camera at 11 pm and wake your kid up (like I did).In summary... for the price, the good outweighs the bad.

I found several models under $100 that support wireless connectivity, night vision, remote viewing, and pan/tilt features. I also found reviews saying that some are easy to setup, and some are not. I was hesitant to buy one of those ip cams because I am not network savvy , and I was afraid the ip cam might not work with my Mac. However, I see Lorex offers variety of home monitor models that meet various user needs. This model, particularly, offers worry free setup with various user needs satisfaction. A quick and easy setup guide lets me set this monitor with two camera up and running really easy, within a couple of minutes. It was nice to see that both cams equipped with temperature sensor and displays the current temperature on the monitor. Also, both cameras and monitor are battery operatable and charges rechargeable batteries when connected (it doesn't come with the battery though).  Pan/Tilt camera worked really well day and night, panning and tilting. Also,  I could control pan/tilt with the monitor and the angles were better than I expected. I tried about a week long non stop using, and I was surprised that it never lost the signals and never interfered with my existing wireless devices signals. The monitor is also packed with features. It is half inch wider, quarter inch taller and thicker than iPhone 4 and the screen is a tiny bit smaller (3.5 inch) than the iPhone. But it has built-in battery, speakers, and pop out antenna. It comes with charging dock and that's kind of handy. One thing I can complain about is the monitor's kickstand in the back. It is just weak with a thin plastic piece for standing purposes. If I want, I can just unscrew two bolts and remove it, but in my opinion, it will break off easily during use. The monitor unit on battery lasted about 5 hours with the screen on, and it took about 4 hours to fully charge. Battery life isn't too bad for the monitor, but it only charges with the supplied power adapter, not with the usb port.Remote viewing was my anticipated feature of all, so I installed the camera driver (software CD included) on my mac. I followed the instruction for the Skype connection and was able to work within a couple of minutes. Basically, I connect the monitor unit (receiving wireless cam signal) to the computer using usb cable so my computer recognizes the Lorex camera as a webcam. Then it set ups the Skype auto answer to the caller. This setup was easy and working great. But I wanted to see if it works with other applications since I don't use skype all the times. I tried iCam by SKJM and voila! It worked great too with more great features. I connect the monitor same way I used for Skype, then just select the Lorex cam in the iCam server preference menu. They have both iOS and android apps(paid) available and the server application(free). I prefer this app better than skype because it detects motion (not just audio) and sends push notification to my iPhone. I can also set up the motion recording and view them remotely. However, I couldn't find a way to use both cameras at the same time on this iCam app. An additional separate web cam works along with the Lorex unit, but not the two wireless cams on a single monitor unit. Also I pan/tilt wasn't supported on iCam app.Nonetheless, this wireless video monitor set is great for home security/monitoring, not just watching baby or pet. I thought I might not need a monitor unit if I can just connect and view with my iPhone, but actually, this set gives me more flexibility and choices. Not everybody has the same needs on video monitoring and with this set; a user can choose how  he wants to view and control it. Overall, I am satisfied with this set. It has a great wireless range and good built quality (except kickstand). It is capable of two way talk, remote viewing with Skype and iCam for various needs, and, oh it comes with a 1GB micro SD card for recording.", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "So Close To Being Perfect", "Author": "A.

Picture quality seems good, I like the temperature display, and the ability to hear what's going on in the room with the camera.Now for my one gripe: I chose this particular camera in large parts because of the Skype integration. Our entire extended family lives at least 8 hours from us, so I really, really wanted a way for them to be able to log in and see the baby whenever they felt like it. After getting the camera all positioned, I went to set-up the Skype part on the computer. You plug the monitor portion into your computer via the included USB cable, create a new account, tweak a few settings, and viola! your camera is now broadcasting to Skype. BUT - it will only do that when the monitor is synced to your computer via the USB cable. As soon as you unplug it, the connection is lost and you can only see the video on the monitor.I was pretty bummed out when I realized this, to be honest. Yes, if grandma calls and says she wants to see the baby, I can easily hook the monitor back up to the USB cable, but that's not what I was looking for. And forget about the new Dad being able to just take a quick peek at his sleeping baby when he's back at work.I'm going to keep the camera for now, because I like everything else about it.

I bought this monitor, because even though it didn't have many reviews, they all seemed pretty good and I was looking for a replacement for a Summer infant monitor I've had for almost 4 years.  The summer monitor crackles and hisses all night and keeps my husband and I up, so we were looking for a quieter monitor.  Well, this monitor is definitely quiet.  TOO QUIET!  We had the volume turned up all the way and couldn't hear our daughter at all.  We turned off the auto mute (the feature that will automatically turns off the sound if there's nothing going on in the room - great in theory, but the sound needs to turn back ON if there is actually noise going on in the room) The only thing we'd hear is an annoying beep (the alarm) that warns you that there is sound in the room, then the sound would just cut out.  We turned off the alarm, turned up the sensitivity on the camera and turned up the volume.  Same thing.  The sound would switch on for a second then just cut back out.  Not sufficient to wake us in the middle of the night if my daughter woke up and started crying.I woke up this morning at 6:30 and turned on the video...sure enough my daughter was awake and rolling around in her crib, and yet I could hear nothing on the monitor.  At least my Summer monitor was sensitive enough where I'd hear her rustling around or cooing quietly so I'd wake up.  My husband went to get her and I could barely hear him in the room with her!  I talked to customer service, who then transferred me to technical support - after a total of an hour being on hold (30 min. with customer service and 30 minutes with technical support) they told me I had to register the product online to get any help.  Forget it.  It's going back to Amazon and I'll keep looking for another monitor.I did give it two stars because even though the audio has major flaws, the picture is crystal clear and you have the ability to talk to the baby in the room, which is a nice feature.  It also allows you to pan around the room which is also an upgrade from our summer monitor.  But in the end, if I can't hear my baby, then there's no point in having all the extra bells and whistles!!

The SI monitor was constantly flickering in and out, and made it impossible to get a decent night sleep because of the noise associated with it.  We had this one floor away, but probably only 40-50 feet and it was still annoying, and anytime anyone stepped between the monitor and the camera it would flicker and hiss.This Lorex monitor is great for range, and doesn't have any of the flickering and hiss of the SI monitor.  Range has been exceptional for us.  I've taken the monitor everywhere in our house (~2500 sq feet) and have a crystal clear picture.  I even took it outside, and it reaches every corner of our yard (1/2 acre) without any degradation.The picture is very clear, both in light and night mode.  Here are some of the Pros/Cons:Pros:- Good picture quality- Great range (goes every where I'll ever need it to)- Monitor is portable- Has intercom feature to talk back to the room the camera is in.- Able to add additional cameras very easily (up to 4)- Temperature sensor is small, but nice feature, especially if you're on a different floor and temps fluctuate- Camera can take AA batteries (or rechargeable battery pack) if you need to put camera in a spot without power for a short period.  Note that the batteries or battery pack isn't included.Cons:- Lullaby feature is a little hokey (sound quality from camera is pretty poor), but I don't see us using that anyway- Using intercom feature requires holding monitor close to face, and pressing the talk button.  The microphone is very close to the \"Talk\" button, and you can put your thumb over it without realizing it- Internet viewing requires that the monitor be connected to your computer by USB, and works through Skype.  In an ideal world it would allow for wireless, remote viewing.Overall this does exactly what we needed it to do.

Expandable, yes. Upgrade, no. This product comes up short in quite a few areas.The sound quality is horrible. With the sensitivity level all of the way up on the camera, the sound up all of the way on the monitor, and a person speaking only 5 feet from the camera, we had to put our ear to the speaker on the monitor to still hardly hear what was said.The video quality leaves much to be desired. With the lights on, the full-color video is really good. But, turn the lights off and the infrared video quality is barely acceptable. Our three-year old, analog video monitor has much better IR quality video. Also, the older product does so without having red LEDs on the camera; which can be frightening to a toddler in the middle of the night. This camera sports the red LED \"monster eyes\".Skype capability is not as user-friendly as we thought. Creating a new Skype account is easy. Setting it up for auto-answer is also easy. It's all easy. But, in order for someone to call it up and see what's on the other end of the camera, the monitor has to be connected (via a USB cable) to your computer. Sounds obvious, right? Well, we were expecting a little more \"wireless\" connectivity. The product information and specifications seemed to imply a wireless concept. We just assumed the monitor would connect to out wireless router (via WiFi) and we could manage things that way - not the case.Voice and video are sluggish. Our analog system was responsive in real time. When we used this product and our old one at the same time, we notices a 1-second lag in both the video and audio. I guess that's not so bad, but is not what we expected in 2013. Being digital, we also noticed significant pixel disturbance in the video AND choppy audio.With the audio detection and transmission being so poor, some of the automation features on the monitor do not work well. The specifications and intent suggest the audio could be turned off and only when a noise or voice was evident, the monitor would transmit (reducing background noise). If the camera can barely pick up a voice in the first place, it does not alert the monitor to \"wake up\".Camera rotation and slew is kind of loud. While the rotation and slew is really good, it makes a lot of noise (especially when moving downward). That said, our nearly three year old was not disturbed by this noise, once he was a sleep.Need to buy more pieces in order to mount camera on wall. We would prefer to have the camera mounted on the wall, but without additional purchase, you'd have to use double-sided tape (not supplied). We like mounting cameras high, so as to see more of the floor / room. When sitting flat on a table, the camera only looks down to bout 45 degrees from straight down. Mounting high on a wall would be better.The positives? It displays video and has a speaker. Without an additional camera, we cannot comment on its ability to display multiple feeds.Maybe the one we got is just defective? If we hadn't bought it from Zulily.com (no returns), we would be returning it and looking for something different.

The resolution is good and this camera is a lot of fun to use.The reciever unit can be set to turn on when the cameras detect motion or noise.  It's an attractive unit, with a nice charging station.  I get about 4 hours of use between charges.  Picture quality was surprisingly good, in my opinion.  It's definitely good enough to know what's going on in the room you're monitoring.In addition, there are features you don't see on most monitors.  You can use an SD card (included!) to record video.  This is awesome if your kids or pets are doing something funny or interesting.You can also interface this with Skype, so you can share video with grandparents (I don't advise this, honestly), or just monitor things from away.  Being able to take a peek at your home, whenever you want, is an outstanding feature.  You have to plug the receiver physically into your PC to accomodate this feature, which wasn't a problem for me, but some probably would like a totally wireless solution.You can also connect this to a TV.Also, everything feels very well built and works well.

I've spent hundreds on a summer infant monitor and when that one broke twice (both times my fault) I was looking for one that I could view from my phone if I went out.

It also has alerts to tell me when it gets below or above certain temps that you set.Overall I have no complaints about the Lorex wireless video monitor OTHER THAN the fact that it advertises that it can be wall mounted but its not included. It is a separate part that you have to order. In the meantime we've set the camera on the changing table and it works just fine.

That meant sending in the broken unit and waiting for a replacement so I was without a monitor for about three weeks. Now here we are 6 months later and I once again have a problem with the receive. The connection for the charging adapter is shoddy and I can only get the monitor to charge if I hold the cord in a very specific position. Needless to say, this makes it impossible to leave on all night. Now I am just down to using it to make sure my daughter stays in bed at nap/bed time but then I have to immediately turn it off and try to get the cable in a decent position to charge it a little bit.

My previous experience is with a Levana BABYVIEW20. I'll get right to the facts:Pros:- Very sleek / modern looking. Large display makes it easy to see baby. Night vision is great.- Pan / tilt is useful for when the camera gets moved slightly. I found it sometimes didn't work. I had to jostle the buttons a bit to get it to kick in.- You can turn off the beeping alert thing by lowering the alarm volume (one reviewer said you couldn't do this, but you can).Cons:- Has a selective threshold for what level of sound it will transmit. It does this equalizing thing where it detects the amount of constant background noise in the room, sets that to \"zero,\" and will not transmit any sound that is not louder than that background level. This is HIGHLY problematic for us, as we use a white noise machine, and so it will not transmit the baby crying unless she is crying louder than the white noise machine volume. So, she ends up crying for a minute or two before the monitor will kick in and transmit it (when she gets loud enough). Super, super, super problematic. The primary reason we returned it. We are used to having ALL SOUND transmitted, including the white noise sound, as is the case for the Levana BABYVIEW20 (which we love).- CANNOT MONITOR VIDEO AND AUDIO FOR MULTIPLE ROOMS AT ONCE. I was deceived by the text on this page into thinking this was possible, and it was the main reason I purchased it. You can view video from multiple rooms / channels at once, but it will not transmit sound. It says this in the manual that comes in the box. This makes it useless for multi monitoring, and there's no way I'm going to let it scan every 8 seconds between rooms -- I want constant monitoring and constant awareness of both babies in both rooms. 8 seconds is a long time in parent/baby intervention world. I will conclude this gripe by saying there does not appear to be ANY multi monitor that will display and transmit video and sound from all rooms in one view. So, we ended up having to just get a second, independent monitor and we'll use our Levana BABYVIEW20 plus the newer model Levana on a different channel and just tote around two monitors.

Another one that I am using is really good but the thin, large screen, plus a camera you can move remotely makes this a better unit. Although pricier then many other monitors on the market you get what you pay for. If giving as a gift to new parents I think they will be very pleased. I was very impressed with the thorough directions that are very easy to follow. Hopefully my video will give you a good idea of the basics of this monitor system but if you have any questions please feel free to ask.PROS:Well-constructedMulti-featured system3.5 inch color screen for easy viewingIntuitive controlsControllable cameraPlays musicAdjustable audio alarmsGood night visionTwo-way talkCameras are wall-mountableCameras are powered by battery or plugGood battery life on rechargeable monitorMonitor has all the function one needsNight light on stationary cameraCable dressing hardware includedFull easy to follow instructionsSkype accessibleRecordable video / manual or automaticComes with 1g microSD cardView cameras at same timeCONS:Monitor in stand is a little looseOptional stand needed for wall mounting controllable camera", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Higher quality video than audio", "Author": "Eugene Tenenbaum \"reluctant reader\"", "ReviewID": "R1YOUIAJDNAVLI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Lorex LW242B works well, as design, with night vision, two-way talk, and soothing sounds thanks to two (2) cameras: the LW2451AC1 with mechanical 240\u00b0 pan and 130\u00b0 tilt and thus without zooming, and the LW2401AC1 with 31\u00b0 viewing angle and without mechanical pan/tilt. It is expandable and allows simultaneous views from more cameras available separately incl. the outdoor LW2401AC2. The 4-hour battery life seems decent though insufficient for obsessive monitoring. The quality of the video functions is higher than of the audio.Remote viewing on smartphones and tablets requires a Wi-Fi (monitor) cradle sold separately.  Then, Skype works fine on Macs, as the Manual states. However, the personal Skype device needs a speedy downlink (4G) for smooth video reception outside home. Otherwise the connection may drop especially on small portables such as iPod Touch, iPhone 3GS, but unlikely on tablets or laptops connected via Wi-Fi.The setup is easy and well depicted on just 2 pages of the Quick Start Guide & in the Manual on the enclosed CD; both also available from the Internet. The night video quality is at the top of those from the Internet searched for \"video baby monitor night\". The day video quality is good considering the max. 320x240-pixel resolution available. Video can be recorded with or without sound.The operating system (\"OS\") of the home device sending video to Skype and connected to router/modem must be at least Microsoft Windows 7/Vista/XP SP2, Apple Mac OS 10.5.8 Leopard, or iOS 4 (free upgrade from iOS 3)- the most popular now. It cannot be original (1st) Windows XP, Mac OS 10.5.7 Leopard or lower, Android, or else.

If she screams, the monitor \"wakes up\" to a small whisper.  But this does not help me know if something is wrong or if my child is having a restless night.  I got this monitor because my Summer Infant monitor lost video quality, reception range, and the cord went bad.  BUT, I could at least hear my child. That helped one night when she had a funny cough that concerned me, so I went in to check on her and she had thrown up all over herself. The Lorex monitor would not have alerted me to this problem!  The Lorex has a sound alert so I might have known she made A sound, but I wouldn't have actually heard the noise she made. And if she goes back to quiet (like she did the night she threw up), I would not have known something was wrong until the next morning!  There is NO way that could work for me.  We are going to have another baby, and I want sound quality that is good enough that I can hear all the little noises or rustles my baby makes.  All of the bells and whistles are useless to me if I can't hear my baby.  So disappointed!", "Date": "October 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "So impressed I bought an extra camera!", "Author": "A. Hudson \"bisou bisou\"", "ReviewID": "R1NBX3TH8X0HW0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this after reading all the glowing reviews and also was looking for a great monitor for my daughter. The first one I received came with two rather larger scratches on the front screen, but Amazon, as usual with their fast replacement service, sent another one right out. The replacement unit was perfect!I previously owned a mediocre Motorola monitor. I did not think I needed much. After all, my daughter and I cohabitate in the same room. She is 14 months now and my house is not too big. The Motorola though would not hold a charge and the picture was so grainy. After a few weeks, the battery on the Motorola completely stopped charging. I just needed something to see and hear her after I put her down and I was up in the living room or doing housework. I had my eye on this and when the price dropped, I picked it up.I consider myself a picky person, I own a lot of gadgets but this device is impressive! I have a lot of wifi devices in my home along with Bluetooth and I do not have any inference with the monitor and camera. Setting it up was so simple. I like that you can charge the handheld simply by plugging it in at the back or there is a cradle you can lay it in and the cradle charges it (of course the cradle has to be plugged in but is so much easier). The first night I used it I was able to see my daughter was stirring in her crib and was able to go in and calm her down before she woke up screaming. I like that I can see her so well on the monitor. It is in color and whether it is day or night, the picture is excellent! The fact that it comes with a micro card, 16, really impressed me as well. The monitor also has a kickstand in the back which I use a lot to place on a table or counter to watch my daughter. The sound is great too. I can hear her and again, no interference.I liked it so much I purchased the additional camera Lorex LW2401AC1 Add-on Wireless Color Camera for Lorex LW241 & LW2401 . You can have up to 4 cameras on the handheld. With the additional camera I am able to watch my house and neighbors. I also move it, they are easy to move around, and you just need an outlet for the camera. I like that I can hit the record button if needed and capture footage.Another feature that sold me was the Skype feature. I will admit I do not like Skype. I used it years ago and it was a resource hog and also poor customer service. When I bought this camera I wanted one compatible with Apple devices but then remembered I can install Skype on my iPod touches. What you will need to do is set up your own account, and then set up an account for the camera. Install the software and plug in the device through the USB port to set it up, and you are all set! I LOVE that I can check in on my cameras through the Skype application on my Touches. I can also log into the PC to check. Just make sure you name the camera something like lorex.camera and then add yourself as a friend. It is very simple.If there is a con to this device, I have yet to find one. I am so impressed by how much it can do. Also, something I read that was helpful, if the temperature seems a bit off, just pull the `thingy' in the back of the camera out/back a little. It might be too close to the unit where it is reading the heat from the camera and not the room. Since doing so, mine is very accurate.I love this monitor/camera system. I finally found all the features I wanted and it did not cost too much.

It would be nice to move the camera around to see what I want to see without having to disturb my children.2) We tried to record once with a memory card and the card became EXTREMELY hot. I felt like my finger had touched the tip of a hot glue gun. We couldn't find the manual so we aren't sure if we were using the wrong type of memory card. It seemed like the right type of card.

The pan and tilt camera didn't move, no panning or tilting, so I immediatley contacted Lorex for a replacement. They suggested I return it to Amazon for a new one. Amazon replaced the camera without a problem on 12/30/12.The unit then worked well for about a year. When the monitor is actually working, this is an ok device. I also have a Graco, sound only monitor, in my toddler's room as a backup. When they are both on you can hear a slight lag in the Lorex monitor, so the images and sounds are a few seconds behind what is actually going on in the room. Also, the sound quality and volume is terrible compared to the Graco. On the highest volume setting the Lorex is not as clear or loud as the Graco is on not quite half volume. I do like being able to see what is going on in the room though, so I would highly recommend a video monitor versus a sound only one, I just won't be recommending any Lorex products.I'm writing this review 1/3/14. The prong inside the monitor that connects the charger cord to the monitor for charging is broken. We had registered the monitor with Lorextechnology.com, so we opened a ticket online on 12/25/13. 9 days later, no one from customer service had called or written back, so we called them. They had no record of the ticket we opened, and said, sorry it's been more than a year, can't help you. It had been less than a year since the replacement from Amazon had arrived when we opened the ticket, so we tried calling customer service again. This time they said we have to fax a receipt and then pay for shipping to send it back to them. I am terrified of doing this because if they can't even keep track of my online ticket how can I trust they won't lose the monitor completely and say they have no record of it? I wish they would do what Amazon did the first time, send us a replacement and charge us if they don't get the broken one back. Then it would at least be worth trying.I will not be purchasing any Lorex products again in the future, and I will tell anyone looking for a monitor to avoid their products!", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Couldn't imagine not having it", "Author": "kerri sinn", "ReviewID": "R7E4EZJGASKCU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have had ours for about a year now and couldn't imagine nog having it.

We had used this for a few weeks and found that the monitor keeps cutting in and out and shutting down for no reason. It is charged, so there is no reason for it to do that. The battery life was good in the beginning, but then keeps getting worse. I can only use it for 2 hrs tops now without needing to charge it again, it would be fine if I only had one child, but for two that sleep at different times it makes it more difficult. I also don't like that there is no way of knowing how charged the battery is, it will just start flashing 'charge battery' before it's going to die which makes it very inconvenient.

I have a 28 month old and a 10 month old and I will be having my third in late July so I wanted to buy the monitor I wanted the most because I will be using it for years. I wanted one with several features that this one has.I wanted one that could monitor multiple rooms and have the option of a split screen or full screen. I do wish that the screen would only split in half since I only monitor 2 rooms right now but it's not a big deal because even when the view of one room is 1/4 of the size of the screen it's still about as big as the full screen was on my old monitor.I also wanted one with the talk-to-baby function because my 2 year old is in a toddler bed and she loves to get up and destroy her room so now I can talk to her and tell her to get back in bed. The speaker only talks in the room that you have full screen too.Another important feature was the sound bar. There is only one sound bar so it only works when it's on a one room view or alternating between rooms but it's very accurate and convenient.I also really wanted one that could take pictures/video (I haven't tried this yet but I'm glad this monitor has that ability) and the ability to monitor from a phone or other device when I'm away (again, haven't tried yet).Other things I love about this monitor: the temperature display (usually fairly accurate), the battery life on the monitor itself, the charging dock (so convenient and no issues with the magnetic pull being so strong that it moves the whole dock), the kickstand on the monitor, the ease of use (I've never even read the instruction manual other than to sync the second camera...So easy to use!), the clarity of the picture (even at night with the night vision on), the pan-tilt camera (I do wish it could zoom too and also that it had a nightlight on it like the stationary camera), the wide view of the stationary camera and the nightlight, the date and time display (nice to know what time baby is waking up in the middle of the night), the volume levels (no issues at all...I usually have it on 1 or 2 if at all and it's plenty loud, even from a few feet away), the ability to mount the cameras on the wall (hardware included with monitor), the ability to turn off the video part to reserve the battery when the monitor is off the dock, the size of the monitor screen, and the overall quality of the system.I have turned on the music to see what it's like but I don't use it because my youngest sleeps without any noise and my oldest has a particular cd she listens to at bedtime. I seriously love this monitor and recommend it to everybody I know because I've been so pleased.I haven't put batteries in the cameras but they do have that option but I like that they can be plugged in too so they don't just die in the middle of the night. I intend to add on another pan-tilt camera in the future and maybe an inside/outside camera too for home security. I was a little surprised that only the front part of the monitor is black and the rest is white but I still love it and couldn't be happier with what I got for my money! :)I also love that it's digital so it's fully secure and I haven't had any interference because of our phones or other devices. I never accidentally hit the talk button or music buttons either as some reviews said when I was looking. The music buttons aren't anywhere near the things I use while monitoring (they're only next to the power button which slides so there isn't any mistaking the buttons) and the talk button is larger and below all of the other buttons so I never have issues with that either.I hope this helps any other parents looking for something very specific!", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ok", "Author": "Tiffany Belcher \"Tiffany\"", "ReviewID": "R2AFZMT72Y2HZZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Thankful to be able to have this system to watch baby.

We own a Lorex and thought this would be the latest and greatest model2.  We have two kids and needed two cameras3.  We wanted a two-way intercomI was terribly disappointed and returned the camera after one night.  Here are the cons:1.  Cameras don't have mounts - the previous model's cameras had mounts that allowed them to easily attach to a nail on the wall.  These cameras don't have them.  In addition, these cameras are difficult to adjust to the correct angles to view the children.  You have to place them a certain amount of feet away and above the child's bed.  The previous cameras were able to be adjusted to almost any angle.  We couldn't just swap out the old cameras for these new ones.2.  Monitor stand was poorly designed - the monitor fits loosely on the stand.  It was knocked off very easily by children playing.3.  Weak two-way intercom - I was speaking directly into the mic, and my daughter (who was crying) couldn't hear me.  I had to speak so loudly to talk over her, that she could hear me from the other room.  The previous model's intercom was much louder, and I had to speak softly so she wouldn't get startled by my voice.Here are the pros:1.  Bigger, brighter, color monitor - the monitor is big and wide and easy to navigate.2.  Pan/tilt camera - one of the cameras is able to rotate side-to-side and up-and-down.  This allowed me to see my child when she jumped out of bed, but its scope was very limited.3.  Additional features - allows you to view via Skype and record video & audio, but I never used these features.We ended up getting the Motorola (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VL2VRY/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_7) with an extra camera and are so much happier.

Initially all the reviews of Lorex products turned me off. However, I keep at it and really digested what everyone was saying. Not many reviews said do not buy, almost all said this was a good monitor with a few disappointments. However, this would not be an accurate description. I think this is an ABSOLUTE BUY, and feel that there is a little room for refinement. However the leap forward this monitor takes is so great. We have a summer brand monitor that was really expensive when purchased 2 years ago. That monitor is lucky to still be in the house.

In fact we opted to just turn off the volume so we could get some sleep, totally defeating the purpose of the monitor in the first place.In Comes the Lorex!!Just set-up the Lorex and absolutely love the fact that there is not any white noise or static pops.PROS:Ease of useEase of SetupFeatures: Pan title camera is awesome, so cool.

E. Nelson", "ReviewID": "R3WHGJG3932JC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "In the mere 9 years since I had my first child, baby monitors have changed drastically.  I remember the first baby monitor we had consisted pretty much of a microphone on one end, a speaker on the other, with a terrible, static filled, unencrypted wireless connection in between.  When I first saw this set, I thought that this would be a huge improvement over the old mic and speaker system.  While this set is pretty awesome in some ways, it does fall short in others.The set I received consisted of a stationary camera, a pan/tilt camera, and a receiver/display.I set up the cameras in various locations around the house.  I found that I did not have any reception problems with having the cameras a floor beneath me and on the other side of the house as long as I had the antenna on the receiver extended.  With the receiver antenna left down, communication with cameras on a different floor would occasionally cut in and out.The quality of the optics was acceptable.  I thought the night vision capabilities were astounding.  When I first began testing the system, I actually checked to make sure I did not leave lights on in one of my child's rooms.  While the receiver has a color display, I thought the daytime optics were only acceptable.  On the pan-tilt camera, it looked like the color is washed out and faint.  I honestly cannot tell if the stationary camera is even color.  I suspect that it is.  However, the image transmitted seems to be black and white with just the faintest touch of color to it.The audio on the system is where I feel this monitor is really lacking.  If you set the monitor next to a TV or a radio that is constant and loud, you can hear the noise over the monitor.  However, faint noises like a child starting to fuss or rustling covers do not seem to be picked up and transmitted via the camera systems to the monitor.  Even with the receiver volume turned all the way up, faint sounds are still very faint.The system does make a chirping noise by default when it senses noise in a room.  This does make up for the lack of audio somewhat.  If you are up for the day and are listening to the monitor, then the noise will get your attention.  However, when I was sleeping, the chirp alert was not enough to wake me up.The receiver has a scan feature that at first seemed ideal for nighttime use.  The scan feature scans the cameras on the system.  The screen on the receiver is blacked out until the scan algorithm senses noise.  This seemed great at first and does seem to do a decent job.  However, while playing with the units, I found I could stand in the room and talk directly at the camera in a normal conversational voice and the scan mode would not pick it up.  Other times, my dog could be outside barking and the scan mode would sense it.  When the system had the screen off and was waiting, I can hear what sounded like faint electrical interference coming from the receiver speaker.  I do not think it would bother me to have on at night, but it could be annoying if you are a light sleeper in a quiet house.The receiver does have a \"talk\" button you can push to talk through the speaker of the active camera.  I found that when someone talks via this mechanism, their voice does come through quite well.  However, you cannot talk and listen at the same time.  When you release the talk button, there is a delay before you can hear on the system again.  This makes any attempt at a two way conversation over the system quite difficult, especially with young children who do not realize they need to wait a few seconds before responding.The tilt-pan camera is a very cool toy.  I am sure some people would find it useful.  It has provided me entertainment letting me follow the dog around the room at night when I am working (I work the graveyard shift at home).  While it is a very cool camera, I am not sure if it is a must have feature.I personally did not test the Skype and recording features.  I do not use Skype and I did not have the urge to record sleeping kids, though I can see some bonuses to this feature.If the company were to fix the audio issues on the camera, I think this would be an awesome set.  As it currently functions, I think the set is good, but people need to be aware of the systems inability to pick up, transmit, and amplify faint noises.  Zoom abilities would be a nice touch, but the lack of zoom does not affect the functionality in my opinion.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great monitor!", "Author": "Rachel", "ReviewID": "R1CB6A0FOMZWTD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I haven't tried some of the more complicated aspects of this monitor like skype.

The Lorex Wireless Video Home Monitor LW242B is a perfect example of how far video monitoring has come.The LW242B is so feature rich that it is easy to get blinded by the novelty of it all. However, it still serves a very functional purpose.The portable monitor has to be the best improvement over older monitors. The monitor itself provides a decent enough picture quality from one or multiple cameras, while also acting as mission control for the whole system. From the portable monitor, one can utilize two way communication features, adjust specific camera functions, pan and tilt the adjustable camera, set alerts for various occurrences, and monitor multiple cameras at the same time or one at a time.The cameras themselves possess capabilities that are way beyond the single function cameras of old. Night vision is automatic, this is nothing too new. The cameras themselves act as two way communicators, so a separate audio monitor is no longer necessary. Depending on the camera, other features are provided such as pan and tilt (very neat), night light, and ambient room temperature. While it might sound ridiculous, the room temperature is one of my favorite features. Due to the way our house is set up, the room temperature fluctuates pretty drastically from room to room; enough to make a little one uncomfortable.The system boasts the ability to access remote monitoring through Skype. I was originally chomping at the bit to try this out, but after reading the number of steps required to set it up, and reading of the substandard experiences others had with the feature, I am still yet to get around to it.Outside of the remote monitoring feature, I believe that I have at least tinkered with every other feature of the system, and I have been quite impressed.I have only ever had experience with other Lorex systems and, therefore, my basis for comparison is slim.

And I can see us using it daily for many years, as long as it keeps working that long! It's great to be able to work on dinner in the kitchen while my girls play across the house and I can STILL keep a close eye on them. If we think we hear them at night, we can easily check on them via the video monitors to see if they are awake and need something without risking going in and waking them up if it was just a false alarm. Plus, I can scold and break up (most) fights while still cooking or cleaning. Not that children should go completely ignored because of a video monitor, but it's a luxury you don't understand until you've used one of these video monitors! Both you and your children have more freedom AND safety in their own home.This Lorex home monitor is very nice and works great for us. Setup was extremely easy, we were up and running within a couple minutes! I like that the monitor charges on it's base, but you can pick it up and take it with you at any time, it won't shut off. You can set the two cameras up to sequence, or display their images side-by-side constantly. Or, you can just chose to show any one camera at any given time and turn off the sequencing. I read that you can add up to 4 cameras with this monitor, and I'm thinking we might just have to add one or two! Although our house is small, this home monitor can also serve for home security purposes, not just keeping an eye on kids.One of the cameras that comes with this set is stationary, but the other one can tilt and rotate, which is really nice. You can purchase additional cameras of either type to go with your monitor. I also really love that it came with a little SD card, and I've already recorded a few cute videos of my girls playing, unaware they were being watched. What a great feature. Other nice features include a temperature display, this is really nice for us because we have an old house and live in a cold winter state, I love being able to check the temperature of my girls rooms at night. Also, there is a talk button, handy for all sorts of reasons--soothing your kids, scolding if they're fighting or about to be naughty, or calling them to supper, etc. We have found that you do have to hold down the Talk button for a good long second or two before speaking into it, and also hold it for another second before releasing, just a tip.This is the second video monitor we've owned (the other was by Levana), and both my husband and I feel that this one seems to be well made and sturdier than others we've seen. Two small complaints, as other reviewers have noted, the display is not quite as clear and quality as the product images show. It's not the best quality, true. But we have a good DSLR that we use for getting good pictures, this product is simply a monitor. As long as I can tell whether or not my child is either in bed or climbing on furniture, that's good enough for me! The other small complaint is that the volume on the monitor doesn't get very loud. Other reviewers have mentioned it, and I agree with them, so I'm listing it here. BUT, that said, this doesn't bother us as at all. In fact, I really don't like to hear my kids screaming and squealing that loud anyway. A dull, muted version is fine by me, I hear enough of it in the car and at the store. Kids are loud, the monitor doesn't have to be. This monitor gets loud enough for US. However, I can see how this might bother others, especially if you have a newborn. So those are just two small things to consider before you purchase.This video monitor is full of great features, and it seems to be very well made, we're so happy with it! I think most other customers would be, too. But if the lack of volume and screen quality are really important features to you, you might want to shop around a little more.

The screen's picture quality was very good but I found looking at the screen later in the day with less light it showed more clarity on the screen The battery life lasted a little over 5 hours which I found disappointing, especially for those who would like to monitor for at least 8 hours at a time when they are at work or when their child is sleeping in the evening. The sound was not the best. I found it to be garbled when someone is not standing close enough to the camera. Speaking of cameras you can add up to 2 more cameras in addition to the two that are included. Another great feature is that this system is portable so you may take it with you when you travel or have your children sleeping over a grandparents or friends home.

First of all, this product is not exclusively a \"baby monitor\".  It's formal description is a \"wireless video home monitor\", and that is how I intend to use it.  Since my kids are no longer babies, I don't need it to watch over them while they are sleeping.  However, it can be used in other ways that I find very beneficial.I have another Lorex monitor, Lorex LW2003 LIVE snap Video Baby Monitor (White), and thought highly of it.  However, it only came with one camera though 3 more could be paired.  The LW242B comes with 2 cameras but at a higher cost.What I like about the LW242B:1.  It comes with 2 cameras instead of one.2.  One of the cameras can rotate and view up and down by remote control.3.  Both cameras good night vision.4.  The monitoring system can be hooked up to Skype5.  The range is fairly adequate - up to about 100 yards.6.  Picture quality is adequate though only black and white.7.  Ability to listen and speak with baby or whomever is in the room.8.  One of the cameras can be powered with 4AA batteries.9.  Monitor has larger screen and flip out antennae.10. Can wall mount both cameras.11. Comes with 1GB micro chip and adapter12. Can take pictures and video13.  Temperature readingsHow well all of these really works - 2 cameras are better than one.  the rotating camera is kind of noisy when it rotates but still, it's good if you need to follow a toddler around a room or just want to check out other areas of the room.The night vision is very good.  I can easily see what's going on on both cameras.Skype - Especially good if you are monitoring your home against break-ins.  You can check periodically to see what's going on.  But, as far as leaving your child unattended and checking on him/her from the office - that's a really bad idea.  To check on how the babysitter is doing - great.Range - I walked down our street while holding the monitor and got to around 100 yards before it went black and said, \"out of range\".  Our house is all brick so I don't know if you would get better range in other construction.Picture quality is certainly not HD or in color, but it's clear enough.  Night vision was very good.Communication - very clear and easy to use.  I was getting distracted with the \"white noise\" but there is a way you can turn it off in the menu.  After the camera detects a loud enough sound, the sound will turn back on but will then turn back off if no more sounds are detected.  I like that function because if I'm at the computer or watching a movie, I can still monitor but I don't have to be distracted by white noise (static).So far only only one of the cameras can be powered by batteries.  The camera that rotates needs to be connected to a power source.The monitor itself is fairly easy to use.  There are lots of buttons on the sides that I had to read how to use in the manual but it's all still simple enough.  The flip out antennae definitely helps with range.I won't be mounting my cameras since I like to move them around, but it comes with all the hardware for wall mounting.Other observations:  You can watch via the monitor both camera views at the same time, but each view only uses 1/4 the monitor screen.  It would have been nice if you could enlarge each view to 1/2 screen each.The non-rotating camera was not paired with the monitor and lost pairing once afterwards.  So I've had to re-pair 2 times.  I don't know if this is going to be a chronic problem or not.The music included is kind of cheesy.  I really wouldn't want my baby listening to electronic generated music.  I think they could have easily made room to install realistic music played on real instruments.  I doubt I would use that even if I were using this system to watch over a baby.Most of the functions are fairly intuitive though it was nice to have the manual.  An English and French manual are included.  A USB cable and DVD are also included.I would only take a video or pictures if I saw someone breaking into my house.  However, I can see how it would be nice for new parents to video tape their baby sleeping or playing.The temperature is in degrees Fahrenheit, but I haven't checked to see if there is Celsius option in the menu.  However, I had both cameras side by side overnight, and one camera read 73 degrees and the other 71.  So, the temperature reading is only a general reading and not accurate.  I will later use a calibrated thermometer and see how accurate the temperature readings on the cameras actually are.Overall, I give this system 4 stars but that means I think it's a very good system.  Only time will tell.  I will update this review as I become more familiar with the functions and operations of this product.  I have yet to connect to Skype to actually see how well it works.", "Date": "October 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Premium Baby Monitor", "Author": "MussSyke", "ReviewID": "R33515P3PPN4FU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It appears as if they thought about everything when designing this baby monitor.  While I just read an article about how many people are using these types of things to spy on their spouses, this seems very legit in its claim to be a baby monitor.  I know Lorex from their security systems; the technologies obviously overlap comfortably and allow them to pull off a great baby monitor.  Here are some of the things I find exceptional:1)  Easy to use.  I was quickly able to figure out 95% of features in a few minutes without picking up the manual.  It might not be quite that easy for everyone, but it won't be difficult.2)  Lots of safety and extra features integrated:  Each camera has a temperature sensor (and an alarm can be set), the stationary camera has a night light, and each has various mounting positions (wall mounting of the pan & tilt camera requires buying a bracket).  Includes cable clips to keep slack from presenting a choking hazard.3)  Each camera functions as a two-way radio, so you can talk to the child (it's half-duplex, so you need to hold a button to speak, and you cannot hear simultaneously) or just listen.  Has an auto mute feature to eliminate background noise except when it senses noise in the area; each camera has adjustable sensitivity, and the monitor will beep (adjustable down to mute) when one of the cameras picks up noise.4)  Reliability.  The range is plenty for my house, and surely for bigger houses as well.  Has a pop-up antenna for better range if needed, and the \"CAM\" writing changes to red when it misses a beat (all missed \"beats\" I've experienced have been for a brief moment).5)  Ability to record automatically (according to sound) or manually.6)  Multiple camera set-up and view.  Not only can you set up four cameras, but you can set the monitor to off until sound is heard by one, or you can set it to show each in succession, or you can watch all four (or three or two) at once (without sound).7)  Lullaby music included (see related negative below).8)  Charging station included (see related negative below) and monitor has a fold away stand integrated.  Both cameras and monitors have 5V, 1A chargers included, so you should be able to charge via USB with the correct adapter (search Amazon - I've seen them for under $2) if you happen to have a USB port more conveniently located than a wall outlet.9)  Night vision works well.These things are imperfections:1)  I believe the resolution is 320x240, so it's not nearly like the perfect pictures on the box.  Then again, I never expected it to be.  Records to *.avi and does not use H.264 compression, so the included 1GB SD card can only hold 105-170 minutes of recording depending on activity.  This is where it starts to falter if you want to monitor your home for security purposes, but not necessarily as a baby monitor.2)  I would be afraid making my kid listen to the included music may be construed as torture by some Social Services people.  I assume they picked it because they didn't need copyrights.  There are only four songs and I didn't see any way to overwright them or include my own music.  That would have been great.3)  You should be deliberate when controlling the monitor.  I wouldn't say there's anything wrong with it, it just isn't as responsive to quick button presses as you might expect if you're used to some other electronics that are super responsive.  Not really a negative, just something to get used to.4)  Night light not controllable from the monitor5)  light sensor on the pan & tilt camera is placed in such a way that if you're looking at the ceiling for some reason, you will always be looking in night vision.6)  The charging station is charge only and without enough meat to enable easy operation (button presses) without holding it in place for fear of pushing it off the charging contacts.  Would be nice if it were a little more substantial and included a USB connection to the computer, which would help with number 7, below:7)  Skype feature works, but is less foolproof and robust than a proprietary solution might be.  For Skype, you have to have everything set up ahead of time.  You can only view one monitor and cannot operate any of the other controls.  If Skype would ever start to charge for service...On the other hand, you can probably get this to work with other such services, but I don't think you'll ever get the other features to work remotely short of writing your own program.8)  You can run the fixed camera off 4 AA batteries or an optional battery pack, which is a nice option to have, but the life is said to be 4 hours, which is way too short to be practical in most cases.9)  If you are on quad view, viewing multiple cameras at once, you must switch back to sequential view before you can pick which camera to view indefinitely.  Really only an extra button press, but needless nonetheless.As you can see, all the imperfections are extremely minor.  Enough to remove a star, but this is a very cool system, with all the local features well thought out.  I'd recommend this as a high end baby monitor to just about anyone.Oh yeah, and having a second camera is great, even if you only have one - or no - kids.  You can set it up to see who's knocking on your door, for example, and presumably set it up so the monitor comes on when they knock.  Once the cameras are paired, they work right when you turn them on, so there are lots of opportunities to utilize them.", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very simple setup", "Author": "J.

It runs quietly. I do like the camera that can move via the viewer as well, but it does make a little noise when it's moving. It is a nice feature though for a large room. I also want to point out how easy it was to set up. The pairing worked very simply. Just push the button on the camera and then select the channel on the viewer. No issues at all. I haven't pushed the range on it yet, but this one has the fold out external antennae. This I'm hoping will allow me to go all the way out into the backyard.

Mislead.", "Author": "Henry Lee \"Tyrant917\"", "ReviewID": "R3GZT9GPB3B9D8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When my son was born, a friend gave us a Summer Infant Best View (older model than what's currently sold). That one worked very well. Remote pan/tilt. Good audio reception and volume. Decent range. And a monitor module that had a belt-clip so you can easily bring it around and keep it on you. Unfortunately the Summer Infant died after about 19 months of regular use. I felt it should've lasted longer, so I decided to try a different brand.After reading many online reviews, I decided to try this Lorex. AT THE TIME, it had great reviews all over the place. Unfortunately, after purchasing it, I was disappointed. This Lorex has design flaws that makes it functionally inferior to the Summer Infant model that I had. They are:- A monitor unit that is designed to be stationary. It has no clip for you to hang on your belt/waist. This is an annoyance because you always have to carry it around by hand or set the monitor on a table. If I'm doing chores around the house, the only way I can keep the monitor with me is if I hold it or if I happen to have a pocket.- A flimsy pop-out antenna that has little or no effect on the reception. Just keep the antenna folded up. It makes no difference.- Poor reception range. Yes, the Summer Infant's antenna stuck out like a thumb, and the monitor unit is not as pretty as the Lorex iPod-like form factor design, but it worked and the antenna wasn't flimsy.- A camera module that can't be mounted to the wall (The Summer Infant had screw holes for you to mount). This is a major annoyance because if you really want to monitor your child well, mounting any camera to a high-point in your room is a must. The Lorex camera module is really meant to sit on table or shelf (generally too low to get a good bird's-eye view). Additionally, you can't tilt the camera much below the horizon level, so your vertical viewing angle is quite limited.Now for the mildly annoying things about this baby monitor. Lorex tries to cram additional gimmicky features that aren't designed and implemented well, just so they can double the price. Some of these gimmicky features are:- Live/Skype is gimmicky and really shouldn't be part of a baby-monitor's feature set. That's what today's laptops and phones are for. You don't need to take my word for it, just read other people's thoughts on this particular feature.- The speaker on the monitor unit is quite poor. The volume level is not very loud. I think that's why they implemented this digital beep feature on the monitor if the camera detects a spike in noise level. The digital beep is much more noticeable if the ambient noise of your room is high. But really, if the volume on your monitor was actually loud enough, that digital beep feature wouldn't be needed.- Record video and audio. I just don't see myself using the recording feature at all. The video resolution and quality is only sufficient for me to monitor my son's presence. I'm not certain what the resolution is, but it's quite low -- probably around 640x489 -- less than 1 megapixel for sure. If I wanted to shoot/record something memorable, I'm taking out my 16 megapixel point and shoot camera.For heaven's sake, why can't someone just make a really good quality baby monitor with great basics, great design, no gimmicks, and charge a decent price for it? Whatever happened to refinement and making a product better and better. If you're going to cram in new features, you have to make sure the basics work really well.So you see, after reading and watching all the great reviews about this Lorex baby monitor, I really thought this would at least be just as good, if not better than, my old monitor. Unfortunately it fell far from expectations. As a result, I highly suspect Lorex paid (or somehow recruited) many people to provide positive reviews when they first released this product.

But when we moved to a larger home, the range was awful, and after a while the volume on one of the monitor units started to short out, and by the end, we either had no volume or it was all the way up.The Lorex has been great so far! I have been very impressed with the quality of the product. It was easy to set up and easy to use. I only have a few complants, if you could even call them that. The pan and tilt camera doesn't have mounting hardware or holes. We ended up mounting the camera to her bed using extra strength velcro. Also, the camera cords are not very long, and we had to use an extension cord for one of them. The other issue that I have is that the monitor itself really needs to come with two cords. Ideally, we would keep a cord in the kitchen and the docking station in our bedroom, so we only had to move the monitor at morning and night. Or a second monitor option would be awesome, too!All in all, this is a great system and we have been very pleased with it during the short time we have had it! My kids love that we can talk to them in their rooms (although our 3 year old was freaked out a bit by this at first!). And I really like that we can record what is happening in their rooms with an SD card. Our special needs child has sleep issues, and it is nice to be able to record her at night in an effort to track her sleep patterns without having to be awake or set up another video system somehow.As far as the selective mute funtion and the alarm funtion- people have complained that these don't work well or are too loud...but you need to know that both of these functions are OPTIONS! They can be turned off if you don't like them!", "Date": "May 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Did not like", "Author": "Gvenzen", "ReviewID": "R29NVN9EGQ4JCW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this monitor as a recommendation from a friend.

I love the split camera view. It allows me to see both babies at the same time. The camera view shuffle is also nice because I can see them in full screen. It does take some adjusting the noise sensor, otherwise it rings a lot. Battery life is great. It has a dock that I put on my nightstand while it charges.

I did not order the new one, I ordered the \"used - like new\". There was not supposed to be any scratches or signs of wear. However, as I was taking the camera out of the box I noticed a scratch on the black plastic rim about an inch long. I guess poor inspection on Amazon's end as it was from their warehouse. The screen is not near as bright and detailed as I was expecting. If anything it seems kind of dull. I read several reviews about people saying the intercom does not function well, this is correct. Unless your mouth is right up against the microphone and you wait a few seconds after pushing the talk button before speaking, it will not work. Also, the bottom of the screen as a flicker to it non-stop. I don't know if this is normal on the units or just a flaw of buying a \"used - like new\" one from Amazon. The range seems good, we have a 2400 sq ft house and I get great signal everywhere. I bought an extra camera to go with it, the pairing process was very simple so that was a plus. Still haven't tested the night vision yet, we shall see tonight how that functions. My friend ordered one yesterday from Amazon after I was ranting and raving about it (from my research it looked like a winning deal) but now I am kind of embarrssed about persuading her to order one... it's not as good as I was expecting.We shall see if I end up sending it back or not. I would like to find out if the picture is dull and poor quality on all of them or just because I ordered the \"used - like new\" one from Amazon.
