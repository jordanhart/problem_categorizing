{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Faulty Batch or Faulty Model?", "Author": "MarioV73", "ReviewID": "R37K06YAXV03DV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased two of these cameras, and I don't know whether it's a bad batch or a bad model, but both of the cameras behave the same way. What is happening with them is that the top 10% of the video displayed (live) and captured by these cameras is shaky. This shakiness happens whenever there is movement and sometimes even when there is no movement. The shakiness is not present when these cameras are in their night/b&w; mode. I tried different cables and transformers on both of the units, but they still behave the same. My other cameras, some are also GW brand, do not display this shakiness even with the cables and transformers I used on these \"faulty?\" units. It's too bad, because I got them at a nice price. Now, instead of celebrating a bargain, I'm regretting the purchase.", "Date": "November 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B007TAHGUG"}}
