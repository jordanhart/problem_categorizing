{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Do not buy TENVIS! Please read!", "Author": "Seaxouri", "ReviewID": "R1LC876W5MW6E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Tenvis cameras create files with a .v264 extension.  This file CANNOT be played back with any standard players, like Media Player or VLC.  The ONLY way to play these files is with a Windows only player that Tenvis provides, and it is terrible.  It hangs all the time and it stutters playback (it will play smooth for 5 secs and then pause, then jump to 8 secs.. every single file!).  This also happens to be when there is motion detected, so you cannot see anything during that critical time window.  There is also a converter they provide that makes an AVI file, but it only creates a tiny image (like 320x240), and it only converts ONE file at a time (and you need to manually specify the input/output for each file .. you cannot batch process a set of files (a typical day might consist of hundreds of files to scan thru.. so you have to manually select every single file and push 'OK'). Also, the converter is all in Chinese, so the popup messages are unreadable unless you can read Chinese.  Apparently these are common complaints with Tenvis products for over a year now, and they have done nothing to improve! Stay clear! $130 bucks wasted IMO.Update: You can use this camera with VLC and a special configuration that pulls the video feed directly from the camera, rather than using any of the camera's built-in features.  This way you can tell VLC to save the video stream.  I was also able to use iSpy as a monitoring system instead of the built-in motion detection.  One problem is that the video stream from the camera blips periodically, causing false triggers in the motion detection. In any given day, I would get about 300 of these '8 second blips' that contains nothing important to capture.  If you want to use this camera as something to just monitor realtime (not automated) it seems fine.  If you want to monitor for movement, its a bit frustrating.  Night Vision seems pretty decent, but even in moderate light, it changes to night vision mode (black and white). There is no built-in audio either.. its video only.  There is a plug that I think might be for a microphone, but there was no help or instructions with the unit, and there is nothing online to explain how to connect a microphone.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tenvis", "Author": "Dolores Tripp", "ReviewID": "R19DS4CJ1ONTA8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I will be looking for another brand to buy.
