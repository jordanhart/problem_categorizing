I have four of them placed on each entrance of my house and they look like real cameras. My goal was to get something as a deterrent and these are perfect for what I wanted. Not sure why anyone would rate this less than 5 stars unless their expectations were to get the same thing out of the dummy camera, that you would in a real camera. I intend to buy two more and place them by my shed in the yard", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Ingenious little thing!", "Author": "M. A.

But it is at our front door, winking its redlight on anyone who rings the doorbell and looks quite official.  And it comes with a sticker that says a surveillance camera is in use.A good  inexpensive ploy well worth the money.", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fake Security cameras", "Author": "L.
