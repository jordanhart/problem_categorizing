{"Reviews": [{"Title": "1080p at a great price", "Author": "jtodd", "ReviewID": "R1EZF3NZFG2YO1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using Axis cameras for a while, and I really like them, but the pricing on those is crazy-high.  I decided to take a chance with this camera, thinking that it probably wouldn't work with my system - it was too cheap for a real 1080p camera.  However, I've been pleasantly surprised.  I've had it running for two weeks now, and it's been great.  The resolution is high (SecuritySpy for Mac records native as \"2024x1536\") and the picture quality is good.  The edges are slightly blurry, but I've heard that switching out lenses or opening the case and relieving stress on the lens by re-seating will help that.  But it's not enough to worry about, really.  (those instructions and reviews on other models using the same case, like I think the 722.)I'm getting 15fps even on a poor quality ip-over-power adapter, so I'm sure it'll go to 30fps with a native cable.  Overall, quite happy with the camera and the response from the vendor has been excellent on a few questions.Notes: The web management port was set to 8081 (or was it 8080?) by default, and not 80.  The RTSP port is therefore 10081.  The camera best works with 850nm illuminators says the vendor, but I'll find out more about that shortly.", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not too bad", "Author": "Gabriel Russell Hill", "ReviewID": "R3NMKXKOY8SJZE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my first home 2 months ago. Had some stuff stolen on my property, and decided I would invest in three outdoor POE cameras. I wanted POE, as Cat5/6 cables are easy to run, and don't require any electrical needs other than a POE switch. I have one camera mounted at the top corner of the house (2-story home), one on the front porch, and the other on  the back. They are much bigger than they look in the picture. They feel sturdy, and look weatherproof (being IP66 they better be!).I have had them hooked up for 3 days so far. Temperature has been 29F-45F, and it has rained/snowed a little. So far they have been great. They have a very wide angle view.The only thing I have noticed that I wish was better is the motion detection. It does not pick up stuff far away, which I was hoping for. I basically had to set the sensitivity to 100, and it records 24/7 as far as I can tell. Right now I have it recording to a laptop, as I have not moved in the home just yet.I will post back after a couple of months.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for the price", "Author": "Jeff Dale", "ReviewID": "ROZ8J9E973W72", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased HVC822 for use with Blue Iris.
