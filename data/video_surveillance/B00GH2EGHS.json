{"Reviews": [], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Award Winning Design: The ClockCam's rounded corners, side-mounted stereo speakers, and slick anodized aluminum casing give it a sharp, modern style consistent with high-end electronics. It's a quality piece to place in your home or office for playing music or setting alarms - and nobody will suspect its secret features.\nMusic Player: Built-in 3-watt stereo speakers with Surround Boom technology deliver incredible audio from this compact, portable gadget. Connect your music player or upload music on a MicroSD card to hear your tunes at the office or at home. Most common audio formats are accepted, including MP3, WMA, WAV, and ACC.\nExpandable Memory: By using removable MicroSD cards to store video, the ClockCam has no limit on the amount of video you can record and store. Just replace the card when it reaches its limit. It also offers cycle recording, which continues recording even if your memory is full (replacing the oldest footage with the newest), so that you won't miss a moment.\nHigh Resolution Video: Capture clear, crisp 30-frames-per-second video in both standard and high compression modes. Standard setting has 640x464 resolution, but it can be dropped to 320x240 in order to store more footage on the same memory card. In advanced compression mode, the ClockCam can keep storing footage for 30 days straight.", "Name": "House Security Surveillance Mini Spy Clock Video Camera Portable + USB", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411K7LAt0RL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00GH2EGHS"}}
