We are very pleased and feel good about traveling now because of this system.  We didn't have any trouble with it, but the questions we did have were answered by people that knew the system and we actually talked to someone quickly and they spoke english!  It was great, and they were very patient with all our questions before we bought it and afterwards.  I highly recommend it.  Wish we had done this a lot sooner.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "satisfied customer.", "Author": "Rodney Sink", "ReviewID": "R1W4VZMRW5H8ET", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While looking for a DIY home security systems I came across the Simplisafe system on cnet.com.

Thank you for the simple, effective and painless way your system can be installed by the average homeowner. Took about 35 min to install all of the motion, door, window, fire, CO2, panic alarms, siren, freeze and water sensors. The telephone conversations I've had with your support folks to get the system tested and up were professional and very pleasant. They were exceptionally knowledgeable, patient, and efficient. Thanks for providing piece of mind at a very reasonable price. GREAT system - highly recommend.", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00AXSYBRM"}}
