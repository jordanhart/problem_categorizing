Surveillance System 1CNThis video is a review of the CCD camera.", "Date": "June 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cheap camera, so expect to get what you pay for. Not waterproof.", "Author": "DIAB \"DIABox\"", "ReviewID": "R3HU7CJ18KR4WA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this camera to place out at the end of my driveway under a light pole.  I didn't want one that had the integrated IR lamps since the motion capture function on the DVR picks up nothing but bugs flying in front of the camera that are interested in the IR lamps.  This is a big problem in Florida.  This camera fit the bill for my needs.The item says it is weatherproof.  I mounted it on an outdoor electrical box that is mounted on a 15 foot metal conduit that is pressed into the ground about 4 feet, which is easy to do in the Florida sand.  The camera worked great for a few weeks, and then after the first good rain of our rainy season the camera started to fog up.  The next day it rained some more, and this time there was visible water in the camera picture, and upon inspection in the front section in the camera against the lens window.This caused it to stop working.  Now since I had my mount set up for this particular camera, I just went and ordered another.  Meanwhile I took apart this camera and found that the \"weatherproof\" claim isn't all that substantiated with the build quality.  The camera unscrews in the middle, and that seam is covered with tape, the beige band you see in the picture of the product.  Yes, there was a gasket further in the seam, but the water just sitting in there behind the tape was bound to get in, or at least cause it to fog up in the heat cold changes throughout the day.So I took the camera completely apart and let it sit in some rice overnight to get the water out of it.  The next day the camera was working again.  Ok, good.  But I didn't want to do this every time it rained so I put in some dessicant pellets that I had laying around (after cooking them in the oven for a while to dry them out completely first).  This way if any water or humidity did get in, the dessicant would absorb it.I decided that the camera wasn't really waterproof and ready to be put in the path of our daily Florida rains, so I ended up building a rounded cover like you would see on other \"bullet\" cameras that have IR LEDs on them.  It covers the camera so the rain will just run off, and it also shields the front of the camera from the sun like a baseball cap.So long story short, don't plan on sticking this camera somewhere that isn't under cover from the rain.The picture quality is good, but there is a black band on the right side of the image that takes up about 5% of the screen, and this is present on the first and the second cameras that I bought of this type.  The wide angle is also good without too much of that fisheye effect.", "Date": "July 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing cameras", "Author": "KDE", "ReviewID": "RUAHAZARGKLX9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought 2 of these to replace the standard cameras that came with my CCTV system.  The field of view on these is almost triple what I could see with the default cameras.  The colors are sharp and it performs beautifully in low light (much better than the so-called \"night-vision\" cameras that came with my system).

So this was supposed to be an upgrade. At first, I was pretty impressed with this camera since it had a decent daytime picture & had a very good nighttime picture when facing my street. The street lights on my block provide enough light that this camera gave a night picture that was comparable to my Infrared Night Vision Cameras (See the pictures I uploaded yesterday). Also, even though it says it is \"Weather Proof\", I usually take that to mean \"Weather Resistant\", especially with cameras that are under $50, so I mount my outside cameras under eaves etc. to shield them from the elements.Unfortunately, less than 48 hours after installing this camera outside under the eave of my garage it has failed. When I reviewed playback of recordings from the first night, I noticed that it fogged up at dawn, then cleared itself up by noon. I took it down & inspected it, it seemed OK, so I assumed it fogged up outside the lens, not inside, so I put it back up. Today, on the 2nd day of use, I came home to see the live view was just fuzzy black & grey circles. I took the camera down again & you can see condensation has built up behind the lens.I really do not understand how this happened since it is not directly exposed & is somewhat shielded from the elements. It did not even rain, just a light drizzle followed by a heavy fog during the first morning. I have never bought an outside camera that has failed so fast.I also bought a 4 pack of camera cables from VideoSecu that were very thin & 3 of the 4 were no good right out of the box (see my other reviews). I notice all VideSecu products seem to have many good reviews here on Amazon, many more than most other security system products, but after my experiences with a few of their products, I suspect the reviews are mostly fake.

However, after being installed about a week, I needed to adjust the angle. While adjusting it, I lost the picture. After some moving around, it was back and then gone again. I realized it was tugging on the cable. I opened the camera up and found no strain relief on the cable and it was barely soldered to the circuit board (some strands attached, some not). It's very small gauge cable with only a few strands each and while soldering the video wire back, the ground pulled apart from the board.I might try to replace the cable with something a little larger gauge and put a strain relief on it.", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "NOT WEATHERPROOF!!!", "Author": "Zooomis", "ReviewID": "RUQXMO419UMUV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera description claims that this camera is weatherproof, IT IS NOT!
