{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very Nice Camera ... works great!", "Author": "Richard Boyd", "ReviewID": "R6L0LMM6QZYIU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the third Hootoo PTZ camera I have bought and installed in my home security system. I also have a Foscam, and an Agasio. I like all three brands. The Foscam does seem to work best, but the Hootoo cameras are right there too, and seem to give the most bang for the buck. I can highly recommend this Hootoo camera to anyone thinking of getting a PTZ, pan-&-tilt, wireless ip camera.Configuring any of these little ip cameras can be a challenge to the novice. Instructions that come with them are usually written by people who do not clearly understand English. Thus, can be pretty confusing. They also depend on the user having working knowledge of wireless and wired networking. In addition to configuring the camera, the installer should know how to configure the router for reserved ip addresses on your local home network, port assignment and forwarding, and DDNS to view the cameras from phones and other remote/off-site computers.Most routers come with pre-set DDNS providers, which you will need to establish accounts with (either paid, or free) prior to configuring your router, if you intend to be viewing from remote locations outside you home network.. The cameras can also be setup independent of the router for DDNS. However, the DDNS providers the cameras are pre-set to were all in China. I would think that users in other countries might have problems with that, because when they view their home networks remotely while traveling, they would be viewing them via China. Personally, I wanted a provider with servers on my home soil and closer to home. So, I chose to use one of the DNS providers pre-set in my router, which was in my home country (the U.S.).So, before you start to configure your camera, be sure to become familiar your router, and be comfortable with making \"advanced\" configuration changes to it. Each router has a different look and feel (even sometimes different models made by the same company). As stated above, probably a good idea to get your account with a compatible DDNS service too, prior to starting the install.Once you know your way around your router, then connect your camera directly to the router via Ethernet cable to one of the empty LAN ports, and let the camera boot up. When it has completed it's boot, then install the software on the CD that came with this camera ... This \"ip camera tool\" program will find your camera and report the ip address it has been assigned by your router. Enter that address into the address window of your browser and then connect to the camera.It will ask you for a username and password. The username is \"admin\", and there is no password (i.e. just type \"admin\" as the username, and then press the \"enter\" key). I recommend you set your own password. Once you pass the logon, then you will be into the little web-server in the camera.The camera will show you a live streaming video of what it is seeing. I like to just play a little first. To make sure the camera does all the basics. Play with the controls, set the resolution, etc. Look at the different menus and settings you can configure.For basic wireless use, you will need to configure the SSID of your router into your camera. If you have wireless encryption set, then you will also need to program the password and encryption type (WEP, WPA). You might want to reserve an ip address (the one initially assigned is usually best) and set a port for your camera in the router at this time. Then configure those in the camera, too. Once that is done, then you should be able to remove the Ethernet cable, and reboot your camera. It will connect wirelessly. Refresh the connection in you browser. Then test it out and finish your other setups.One note on the transceiver (radio) and little 3dbi antenna that comes with. It doesn't have great range. The picture will be choppy and controls will be slow, if you have a weak radio connection between the router and camera. I replaced the little antenna on one of my cameras with a huge 9dbi to get it to work better when the camera was about 20 feet away from the router, and separated by a couple walls. I've got another Hootoo, and a Foscam in an enclosure, about 100 feet away, and have them coming in through a wireless range extender.=======================About picture quality, etc.This is a low end video camera that costs less than $100 .... If you want HD picture quality that matches your HD TV, on a ip camera that can pan and tilt, then pay the $500 (or more) for an HD, pan and tilt, ip camera, and another $300 (or more) for professional IR illumination lights!!! You get what you pay for. However, with these cameras, I've gotten my complete money's worth!I find that the picture quality for this camera is great during that day. Exactly like a low-end video camera should be. At night, the LEDs on the camera illuminate the area and return a viewable picture to about 20ft. I have had to add some IR illuminators  to the areas that I want to view better (I bought two 40-LED illuminators on Amazon, $12 ea). Also, the microphone and speakers work great. Although, they do not work with any browser, except Internet Explorer, with ActiveX (ActiveX is just a Microsoft software add-on that mimics Java). If you have ActiveX configured properly in IE, the little viewer onboard the camera works like a charm for all features, and with any of the PTZ cameras. I'm currently using one IE browser to monitor four of these cameras (two Hootoos, an Agasio, and a Foscam) ... The software is not perfect, but it's free!I also view my PTZ cameras on my Droid smartphone, and with third party video security software ... The various software and platforms work perfectly with all of the cameras.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works great with a few small concerns.", "Author": "Antonio Darnelli \"tonyd999\"", "ReviewID": "RT9GFZDAN9E67", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The product comes with everything stated - IP camera, network cable, antenna, CD, user's manual, power adapter and some drywall screws.The camera had some thin strings of glue on it - apparently from the packaging.  I couldn't easily remove the glue, so I left it on the camera.  There wasn't any glue on the lens.  The camera is about the size of a can of coca cola - so it was a little bigger than I expected.Setup was nice and easy.  I opened the CD and copied everything to my computer (MacBook Pro).  I then connected the camera (with the network cable) to my router, and started the camera software.  It easily found the camera, and after a few clicks, I was able to make the changes to the settings to match my environment.  I then disconnected it from the router and placed it on my desk.  I was able to set the camera to do motion detection and send copies via FTP of the pictures to my computer.  The software is easy enough to figure out so that I didn't even have to read the manual.The pictures are nice and fairly clear for what you would expect out of VGA (640x480).  The web interface is nice, and the camera scrolls up/down and left/right.My concerns:  On motion-detection, the camera sometimes detects motion and sometimes it does not.  However, this may be due to the sensitivity setting that I chose (5 out of 10).  And, I have the camera pointed outside, so if the wind blows the tree limbs, it will take pictures.  And, one out of every 50 images, the image will be a little messed up - where the bottom 1/3 of the picture is blank.I could not get my router to properly forward the IP address and port number to the camera, so I couldn't test it to see if I could connect to it outside of my home network.  This is probably a limitation on my router.  But, I was able to use my iPhone to connect to it inside my network, and the software worked well.  The buttons to control the camera are a bit small on an iPhone.  It also worked on my iPad, and the buttons were a little easier to control.It works well enough that I am planning on buying a couple more of these cameras.Overall, despite a few concern - but because of the price and features, I will still give it five stars.  I will come back and amend my review if I find out anything important to report.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good outbound audio for baby monitoring. Better video under low light compared with other cameras.", "Author": "New father", "ReviewID": "R3GWL1XWC3FFJ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently bought several different brands of wireless IP cameras. I planed to install some for my own home and for my in-law's home. I previously compared Tenvis JPT3815W, EasyN EasyN FS-613A-M136 and HooToo HT-IP206  cameras on amazon.com. IP206 is perfect for garage door opener control after tinkering with camera settings. Excellent for those who forget to close their door or need to open the door remotely for large-item delivery. Caution: Make sure no kids or other people around the door. EasyN and HooToo have much better outbound audio for remote listening. Good for baby monitoring. All have inadequate incoming audio. Listeners next to the camera can hardly understand the words without repeating by the remote person speaking into IP Cam Viewer.  Luckily, you can phone in instead of relying on the camera if you want to speak to people next to the camera.I just got a Hootoo HT-IP210F camera. It is an upgrade from IP206. Slightly more expensive. If you are comfortable playing with your router settings, you can set up these cameras in a few minutes. Since I have done this before, so it is no brainer for me. Hooked it up to my router with RJ45 ethernet cable. Easily found the LAN IP for 210F on my PC (wirelessly linked to the same router) using the finding camera software from Hootoo (other vendor's camera finder software likely works as well). Entered its LAN IP address in my Google Chrome browser and I saw the web control interface and camera view right away. From the interface you can set up WiFi password to link to your router wirelessly without a cable. 210F will reboot. Unplug the RJ45 cable. Surprisingly you won't see your camera using the previous LAN IP. This is because 210F gets a different IP for WiFi connection! Not the same as your wired connection IP. You can find the WiFi IP if you view your router's LAN connections based on your camera's MAC. If you stick to this wireless IP. No further change needed. To have the same IP for your wired and WiFi connections, you need to set up your camera from its web interface using fixed LAN IP instead of DHCP. Both 206 and 210F have very good audio heard from Android client (IP Cam Viewer app). There is some background noise. When you turn the volume down on your Android phone a little, you barely notice it.  You can clearly and continuously people hear speaking in the room. Definitely good as a baby monitor. Perhaps slightly better than IP206. I am very pleased. My Tenvis JPT3815W is noisy and the outgoing audio keeps breaking up. You can hardly hear a continuous sentence. Not good as a baby monitor. All these cameras perform poorly for incoming audio. The speakers are tiny inside the cameras. Not loud at all. The audio keeps breaking up. Thus, plugging an external speaker may increase the volume, but not the audio quality. Picture qualities are equality good for all these cameras because they have the same resolution. IP210F has more IR lights and IR cut. The IR cut function works well by removing color distortion due to IR in sunlight. Thus, red is red and green is green, etc. You will see a difference when you compare a camera without this function. This function is not for the IR lighting condition under low/no light. Under darkness, all these cameras show washed-out black and white colors with IR lighting.It turns out that this 210F camera has a new firmware (Version 17.37.2.47). By default, it closes (i.e., connects) pin 1 and pin 2 constantly during use. You can change the Alarm Service Settings so it won't do so. However, during booting, pin 1 and pin 2 will close for a couple of seconds. This will trigger the garage door opener! No matter what I do with the alarm services settings, I cannot avoid this. 206 with firmware  17.37.2.41 does not have this problem. This same version is shared by 206 and 210F. I guess if you downgrade the firmware, you will make your 210F work just like 206. I never tried because .47 firmware is not yet available for download from hootoo.com. I need a backup before I am willing to give it a try.People are talking about using a spare Android phone as IP cam. I have two working like this also. However, they cannot be compared with any of these wireless IP cameras. You see nothing using Android under low light, but you can see a dark room with IP cameras having IR light bulbs. Of cause it is very nice to be able to pan and tilt. 210F is slightly more expensive. It is also slightly bulkier in size. 210F has 18 IR lights, 8 more than 206's 10 lights.  When IR lights switch on, there is clicking sound from the relay inside (206 does not have this sound). There is a blinking green light inside the casing (not the indicating light next to those IR light bulbs). It leaks out from the vents under the camera. It may bother you if you place the camera next to bed side. 210F has a wider pan angle (320 degrees v. 270 degrees for 206). All the cameras I tested can be viewed using IP Cam Viewer Android app by selecting. For Hootoo cameras, select Hootoo/Hootoo IP camera.  You can remotely pan, tilt and reboot the IP cameras. 210F has an extra mic socket for an external mic while 206 has only a slot for an external speaker. In all, I am very satisfied with 210F. I use 206 to control my garage door. When I open my garage door, I can view and hear the street traffic remotely. I can hear bird chirping outside and cars passing by. I place 210F in the kitchen. If I do need 210F to control my garage, I think downgrading the firmware will do the trick. I played with motion detection and e-mail, ftp notification. Worked like charm. You can use smtp.gmail.com as mail server with your Gmail login name/password. The problem is that if your camera views too much activity, you get too many e-mails. Thus, after playing, I turned this off. You don't really need DNS server. There is a function in 210F to send an e-mail to your notifying you its current external IP address and port number when it boots. In the US, I have the same IP for years with Roadrunner cable modem service. It never changed even after a long power outage that lasted several days in the Midwest last year.  I also have localphone.com VoIP service. From my account web access with the Localphone, I can see my home router IP address used by my registered IP phone. 210F does come with its vendor provided DNS. I never need it anyway. For all the IP cameras I tested, I see mostly black and white colors at night with IR. This is enough for me. All these cameras have reddish IR lights that turn on automatically under low light. You will notice the reddish lights. Hopefully, babies won't be attracted to them. They all have quiet motors that are hardly audible by people a few feet away from the cameras, unless they pay attention.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value With Great Support!", "Author": "Martin A Hogan \"Marty From SF\"", "ReviewID": "R2HYVW9SW74KT4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the price, this security camera is a very cool item. It can be installed on a flat or vertical surface and comes with a lot of camera options, like view-ability from anywhere in the world from a PC, laptop, iPhone or iPad. It can be set to several different stable angles and there is a tiny speaker for recording or sending sound (I turned mine off). Once set up, you can also remotely pan and tilt the lens to any position. The pan/tilt speeds range from 1 to 10 and there are 15 preset positions for viewing. When motion is detected, it sends an email with a half dozen shots to your account. I set up a separate email account just for this camera so I wouldn't have my regular email overloaded. Note that you need to set the sensitivity of motion to 1 through 10. Having cats, I set it to a low sensitivity. The image is sufficient (640 X 580) and it has `Upgraded Night Vision' with 16 Built-in IR Illuminators. The IR Cut Filter eliminates washed-out or odd or glaring colors.Setup was tough for me, although I noticed other reviewers felt it was easy. I found setup was not intuitive. The instructions that came in the box were very small, so I printed out a larger set. At first, I had trouble and you need to know your router password (write it on the bottom of your router for future use) and mail account passwords. No sweat. I called support and they were on it! In a relatively short period of time, support (through LOGMEIN) was able to teach me how to set up all the features and how to use them properly. The toughest part was writing down the instructions that were relevant to me. It was touch and go initially, but we got it and now I am happy to know I can reset this camera if I need to without support. Do note that support was from California and they were friendly and patient. That was a huge seller for me.There were some interesting things I discovered about this camera. It should be used for indoor use over outdoor (they do manufacture outdoor cameras). Initially I had my set in a windowsill overlooking my front door, but the day images were frequently emailed to me (it detected little movements of shrubbery). I simply lowered the sensitivity. Then the night photos were glaring white. It turns out that the infra-red camera reflected on my window, causing that. I moved it indoor to view towards my sliding glass door and windows. Now when it discovers motion, I get an email to my account within a minute. Even if a burglar saw the camera and stole it (you have the option to turn of the infra-red light), they would be photographed and stored in the memory. Check with your insurance carrier. Some will give you a discount depending on how many cameras and what types you own.I plan on getting another camera soon and the good news is the software is already setup for my PC and devices. All you need is an electrical socket. I'd give it five stars, but I found the instructions to be tough to read and understand - that's a user comment.

It work well with my I phone and iPad so I can keep eye on my house when I travel. Night vision works well with IR LED'd automatically activating when light level is low. I have also tested motion detection that works well after adjusting sensitivity few times. It send me a email with photos when motion is detected in front of the camera.

Don't bother with the CD, because you can set it up without using it.Second, if you do not know how to view what IP addresses are assigned to your DHCP devices, find a computer geek to help you set this up.

You might also notice that it appears to have a bunch of engrish all over the description, so, while I personally haven't had any issues in the first hour of using it, I wouldn't doubt some of the lower-starred reviews claiming to have issues.The Good;-If you read the reviews that say, \"hook up the power and ethernet, grab the DHCP address, enter the default username of admin and no password, then start configuring\" (and all that makes sense to you), you can have this thing configured in a matter of minutes. I also grabbed filezilla server and set up FTP transfer on motion detection in around 5-10 minutes.-Responsive interface for browsers that aren't IE-WiFi setup had me scared for a second, but you have to unplug the ethernet for it to start actually using that interface.The Bad;-Colour is way off (was indoors with blinds barely keeping sunlight at bay.) Assuming the IR filter was on.-No way to turn off the manufacturer's DDNS service (good incentive to change the default login information)-The alarm scheduler is horrific. I couldn't click and drag to select multiple boxes in Chrome, so I had to double click to select 4 block increments (set my cam up to alarm 24/7 if motion was detected)-If you're looking to get this specifically because it says, \"Built-in audio support for two-way communication\", that's exactly where it stops. It's supported via the built-in speaker and microphone jacks that you need to connect your own equipment to. Haven't tried this yet.The Weird;-It appears to have rebooted itself within the past hour of me configuring it, but I don't remember doing anything that would have made it do that.-If it does reboot, it doesn't return to the last position it was in.-Couldn't get email (via gmail account) set up in 5 minutes, so I abandoned it for FTP.-Upload interval on the alarm page doesn't appear to make any sense.

Two of the three are the indoor HT-IP210Fs and the third is a fixed outdoor HooToo. All installed easily using identical software and setups. We relied heavily on the other Amazon reviews to make setup (particularly the WiFi and port reassignments for internet viewing) go smoothly.As other reviewers noted as well, the cameras can be focused. Doing this on two of the cameras significantly improved our image quality.We use the iDevice app \"IP Cam Viewer\" to view our three feeds either using the LAN (which does not use up any of our limited internet bandwidtch) or the Internet (when we are not at home). This has been superior to other apps (including one that HooToo customer support recommended), and we liberally use the presets as well as panning controls on the app, preferring them to the browser-based controls (which don't always work).Because two of our cameras are quite a distance from our house (including one in a duck shed), we connected them to two small solar charging arrays (with DC volt controllers to run 5VDC to the cams) so they would run without requiring AC or house line connections. One of our three is hardwired to our Ethernet backbone while the other two use our WiFi (including an Apple Airport Express serving as a bridge to extend coverage to the animal pens).We had one of the three cameras fail early on in its lifespan (2 months). On careful inspection, an internal motor screw and possibly one of the power wires to the main board had come loose. I was able to remount both using jewelers tools and the camera came back on line.We liked the uniformity in software, the built in dynamic DNS cam-dedicated websites, and the sound monitoring features the best. We're looking at the new outdoor night-IR pan-tilt-zoom next and trying to figure out how to run power out 200 feet from our home to put it up in a field.For the price, these cameras are a great deal.

Beware the multi-step set up required for internet viewing, and very heavy RF interference.", "Author": "P. Pointer", "ReviewID": "RLVE5MK0PUANS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for monitoring a small room where a pet is kept when no one is home.  We wanted both in-home and external viewing of the real time video, using tablets and telephones.  This camera is definitely capable of addressing those needs.I found the setup to be more difficult than expected.  Luckily for me I have plenty of experience with basic network setup, as I think most people would find router port forwarding to be a confusing subject.  HooToo provides a link on the bottom of the camera that works specifically with the unit we purchased.  You simply pick a port (8080 is suggested), configure the port forwarding on your router, and I had it working relatively quickly over my laptop on an external network.  No problems internally, either, via tablet or telephone.  I deducted half a star from five, as the CD provided contained set up software for half a dozen camera models, with a labyrinth of a directory structure in order to find the software required for this camera setup.The real problem came when we started leaving the house the day after Christmas, and found that none of our garage door remotes would work.  With six remotes and two openers all malfunctioning in the same fashion, it was clear to me that something substantial in the environment had changed;  too big a coincidence that both openers started failing, not to mention six different remotes.  A little Googling of interference issues with our opener uncovered problems caused by too much RF interference from these cameras (several models of HooToo cameras).  Following recommendations from other individuals that had solved these problems, I fashioned a card board box around the camera and papered it with tin foil.

After hours of trying to set this thing up I gave up and went to Target to buy a Belkin camera and had the Belkin up and running in minutes. I returned the HooToo camera the very next day.There are Pros to the HooToo camera hardware:-The night vision worked well-The motion detection worked well-the camera would turn to follow you if you walked in front of it-The video quality was fine, and I could view over my home network (but if I am at home why would I need to look at a camera? I need it to work over the internet when I am away from home)The Cons however were just too much-If you know alot about IP and security cameras you could probably figure some of this stuff out by why should you need to? There are other products that are so much simpler, why hassle with this one.-The instructions were written in poor English and were not very helpful-When you try to use one of the 3rd party DDNS providers they are links to Chinese websites.Bottom line, if your a techie person maybe you could save some money by buying this and it'll be fine for you. I consider myself fairly tech saavy and I could not get it to work properly wirelessly (it did work properly over the wired, but I had to be at home for it to work and that defeats the purpose). The Belkin camera was so much easier to work with, take it out of the box connect it to network, download the app, and your done. No messing with IPs or DDNS or chinese instructions. It even has audio and it can send you emails with snapshots when motion is detected. My poor review is based on the fact that this camera is overly difficult to setup compared to competitors.

It has many powerful features that you don't usually find in a security camera in this price range. It is not perfect however but it is very good. I have listed below a list of pros and cons of the unit and I have attached a video of the camera and I point out the product's features. I hope the video is helpful for you.Pros:* Basic installation is fast and simple.* Motorized pan (320\u00b0) and tilt (120\u00b0) functions that can be controlled remotely.* Wireless and wired network options.* Good price for all of the features.* Good instruction manual on the supplied software disk.* Multiple user settings for visitor, operator and administrator.* You can use Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, Google Browser, opera browser or your mobile phone but only the Internet Explorer mode with ActiveX allows you to play video, stop video, record video, use audio or talk modes. You will only be able to take snapshots with the other browsers.* The software can handle 1, 4, or 9 cameras on one screen.* You can add on screen displays of text and date and time for security videos.* Infra-Red night vision capability.* The ability to remote view what the camera is seeing from anywhere in the world using a browser.* The ability to sense noise or motion and alert you via emails with photos of what is going on. You can adjust the sensitivity to motion.* The ability to talk to your family or to an intruder using your remote computer and Internet Explorer.Cons:* Advanced installation is too complicated for the average computer user.* Low quality camera with 640 x 480 pixels but OK for the price. I even had blurred videos in a well lit room. The instruction manual states that the camera should not be manually focused.* You have to enable the ActiveX functions in Internet Explorer and once I did I got continuous warnings regarding possible security issues when using these settings.* Indoor use onlyWhat's in the box?* Camera* Antenna* Mounting adapter* Ethernet cable* Instruction manual* CD with software and a more detailed instruction manual* Mounting screws and hardwareOverall this is a good camera but not great. I have a video surveillance system on my home and I am used to using computerized recording software and night vision cameras. I found the video quality of this camera to be blurry in a well-lit room shooting a person 10 feet away. I also found the advanced set up of the camera to be too complicated for the average computer user. This is one of my major complaints. To get the full functionality of the camera and software you have to use Microsoft Internet Explorer. Using other browsers is possible but you cannot use the record, save and other functions using the other browsers.Using Windows Internet Explorer and getting all of the features requires you to open up access to ActiveX and as a result I got continuous warnings on my screen that my computer was vulnerable to attack because of these settings. This is not exactly a comfortable feeling for the average user. I was using Windows 7 Professional 64 bit Operating System.I rate this product as a 4 star item.I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "A very versatile camera for home or office", "Author": "J.

It's much more detailed, with illustrations and screenshots that cover the complete process of installing and using the camera.Installing the camera to work with my home wireless network was very straightforward and only took a few minutes, including installing the IP camera tool from the CD that was packaged with the camera. The next phase was to be able to access the camera from the Internet. That involved changing some of the settings on my Linksys wireless router. I was a little antsy about this, so I emailed the HooToo tech support, and to their credit, I received an answer within a couple of hours.With the camera set up, now I'm playing around with some of the features like the motion detector and audio connection. I've seen enough already to be very impressed with the HT-IP210F. With VGA graphics (640x480), you won't confuse this with an HD camera, but for surveillance purposes, it's fine. I'm only using one camera, but the user manual covers how to add more cameras to the system. One feature I really like is the ability to set and recall up to 15 preset views. This allows you to see a large area quickly without having to pan and tilt the camera. The camera lens is wide angle, so it's in focus from a few inches to infinity. I'm intrigued with all of the possible uses for the camera, from video surveillance and motion detection as part of a home security system to baby monitoring to just keeping an eye on the kids and pets while you're away.

These devices have come considerably down in cost, and now you can pretty much cover your entire house with decent surveillance equipment for just a few hundred dollars. However, managing these devices is still tricky, and I would not recommend it to people who are a bit more technically challenged.The trickiest thing about this IP camera is, just like with every other IP camera I've ever worked with, the setup. I am one of those people who tend not to read instruction manuals when setting up a new piece of equipment, but when it comes to IP cameras, you absolutely MUST read and follow all the instructions very, very closely. I re-learned this fact with this camera.One of the things that I really like about this camera is that it's software is compatible with all major web browsers, and hence it's (at least in principle) accessible on any device from anywhere. However, for the full functionality you still have to use Internet Explorer on a Windows computer. This includes the two-way audio and the video recording. I am predominantly a Mac user, and this is a bit of a setback for me. Fortunately, though, I still have an old Windows machine lying around, which I use exactly for these sorts of situations.The pan and tilt work perfectly, and without a glitch. The web interface is very responsive, and the camera changes its position almost instantaneously when I use the motion controls.The resolution and the picture quality are OK for the basic surveillance purposes. However, the picture can be a bit blurry, especially in the low light and compared to what we are accustomed now from our basic mobile devices.The reason that I am giving this product five stars despite its shortcomings is that it's still the best IP camera with this functionality that I've tested. I currently own and use a Motorola baby monitor camera, a D-Link camera, and a Foscam camera. They all have pan and tilt, two-way audio, remote access, night vision and basic VGA resolution. D-Link and Motorola have tried making the camera setup more intuitive and streamlined for the average user, but have instead made a mess of things to the point that under certain configurations you can't even use their products. Neither one of those cameras is very flexible and reliable when working with a wide-variety of web browsers. Foscam cameras, on the other hand, are pretty close in quality to this HooToo camera, but I still think that the HooToo camera has noticeably better picture quality, both in terms of clarity as well as the lack of spherical distortions.This is far from perfect home surveillance camera, but in terms of its price and compared to most of its competitors, I think that HooToo camera is the best option for most regular users.", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "BETTER than our Foscam!!", "Author": "MN Fam", "ReviewID": "RCY3OG3G5BGP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Folks, this camera may only be average in spec on paper, but the GUI (software built into camera) is much, much better.

The camera itself is milky white and nice-looking. Also very easy to get it set up.Before testing the camera, I looked over the user manual briefly. Just like what other reviewers mentioned, it IS quite lengthy and poorly written with broken English. But as for persons with savvy networking knowledge, this shouldn't be a real problem at all.To start with wired connection, I powered it on and used the included RJ45 Ethernet cable to connect the camera with my Verizon fios' router. Then I ran the IP Cam setup wizard in the disk to create an IP searching tool shortcut on my laptop screen. No software installation problem with my Win7 32bit system. Double click the shortcut and a small window popped out, automatically showing the LAN IP address, something like 10.0.x.x. No manual operation is required to locate the IP address.The next thing is easy as a piece of cake. Double click the selected ip address to get into a web viewing interface. NO password is needed on the login page, which might be a minor safety concern for some people. Personally, I'd rather spare some time and set up the password in Users Settings of the system menu.Everything was just fine and easy with wired connection. I went on to test the wireless connection. Just list out the steps I did and hope they could be of some help:1) While still in wired-working mode, go to network - wireless lan settings page;2) Click \"Scan\" (maybe nothing shows up). Wait for a minute or two. Click \"Scan\" again and you should be seeing all your routers listed;3) Select the SSID and submit;4) While it is restarting, unplug the Ethernet cable; the camera should be connected wirelessly to your router;5) Close your IE browser and re-run the ip camera tool to log in again6) You should be able to view the camera video nowOverall, I am very happy with this purchase - it's quite affordable, well-built, nicely-packaged, and everything works just fine for me, except the poorly-written manual. Unlike other reviewers, I don't think I can really complain about this camera. After all, as far as I can get a working product, the manual is useless. Actually I threw away that manual shortly after I tested the camera. Despite some minor issues, such as some features of the cam are unavailable for non-IE browsers, ht-ip210f is actually highly recommended for tech-savvy persons if you consider its price and the features the cam can offer.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your time", "Author": "Yasmin", "ReviewID": "R3AZ1UIS1TTAK5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the second IP camera I've ordered from Amazon. I don't know what made me want to try this new one, and I certainly do regret it. It looks nice and everything, with the exception of the power supply which has visable defects along the seams and an a non-working power indicator, but in the end it never worked, and I returned it.Below are the reasons.First of all, my DVD drive couldn't read the disc. The DVD in my laptop works fine, and has never had a problem with any other CDs or DVDs. Anyway, I tried it on an external drive, with the same problem. Empty disc? Strange unknown read issue? I don't know, and it wasn't a great way to get started. I emailed the customer service and received a standard email that advised me to go to a website to download the drivers and software. At first, I was thrilled. Then I tried to access the website and it came up with the unwelcome \"page can not be displayed\" deal. Different browser? Still couldn't open. Computer at work? Nope.At this point I was pretty angry, and figured I'd better call them directly, as my patience was running out. The phone number provided seems to ring indefinately. This would have been such a simple problem to solve, if someone, at some point, had just checked to see simple things like whether the CD's have problems, or the online site is working, or that there is an easy way to reach customer support.It's unreasonable to me that a company who makes security products business provides such an unstable product and support. I considered the fact that maybe I just got a defective unit, but that still doesn't excuse the sketchy customer service. Maybe I was expecting too much.Don't waste your time on this camera - the customer service and quality control are simply unacceptable; In the end I was glad to return it.", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works great", "Author": "C.

HooToo has made the HooToo\u00ae HT-IP210F Wireless IP Network Surveillance Camera as a way to maintain a secure atmosphere.\u25b6 Package Contents\u2022 IP Camera\u2022 Wi-Fi Antenna\u2022 User manual\u2022 DC power supply cord\u2022 CD Rom\u2022 Ethernet cord\u2022 Mounting Bracket\u2022 4 mounting screws with drywall inserts\u25b6 Accessories (Needs DC Power cord length and mounting bracket updated)The Ethernet cord is 56 inches with a thick gauged wire. Although the cord is short, this is definitely one of the better built Ethernet cords I own. The Ethernet cord will do what it is intended for and help setup the IP camera.The DC power cord is 57 inches with a 2.75 x 1 x 1.5 inch brick at the end of the cord. I would normally name this a con, because it would block neighboring outlets, but I would expect this cord to be attached to some sort of extension cord and not a surge protector.The mounting bracket has a 4 x 4 circular platform, with a 20 threaded screw that goes into the center of the bottom of the camera. This platform is guided by a 3 inch arm, which is almost able to maneuver in a little over 90\u00b0. On the bottom of the bracket is the 3.75 x 1.5 platform that can screw into a wall. The mounting bracket is very nice if you need to place your camera in a position that is other than up-right.\u25b6 Specifications\u2022 Powerful high-speed video protocol processor\u2022 High-sensitivity \u00bc\u201d CMOS sensor\u2022 Picture total 300k pixels\u2022 Support PT control, Pan 320\u00b0, Tilt 120\u00b0\u2022 Optimized MJPEG video compression for transmission\u2022 Multi-level users management and passwords definition\u2022 Embedded web server for users to visit by IE\u2022 Support wireless network (WI-FI/802.11/b/g)\u2022 Supporting Dynamic IP (DDNS) and UPNP LAN and Internet (ADSL, Cable Modem)\u2022 Giving Alarm in case of motion detection\u2022 Supporting image snapshot\u2022 Support multiple protocols: HTTP/TCP/IP/UDP/SMTP/DDNS/SNTP/DHCP/FTP\u2022 Support WEP/WPA/WPA2 encryption\u2022 Support 3G phone, Smart phone control and surveillance\u2022 Support Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome browser\u25b6 HardwareThe camera is a little bigger than today\u2019s webcams (8.3 x 4.9 x 6.6 inches; 2 pounds), with a matt black or white plastic design. The front has the lens, light sensitive censor, 10 infrared LEDs, network indicator LED, and microphone. The right side has the speaker, and back has the RJ-45 (Ethernet) port, Wi-Fi antenna, 5V power socket, audio output, alarm I/O pins, microphone output, reset button, and SD card port. The bottom has the specifications and threaded hole for the mounting bracket. Overall, this is an all-in-one camera that seems to have everything it should have.\u25b6 Software SetupHooToo provides two pieces of software for this device \u201cIP Camera Tool\u201d and \u201cIPCamClient\u201d. Don\u2019t worry if you are initially confused, because I was. After reading the manual, \u201cIP Camera Tool\u201d is the only tool required. Follow the following directions to install your camera:1. Install the \u201cIP Camera Tool\u201d and then restart your computer.2. Plug your DC power supply into your camera and power your device.3. Wait approximately 30 seconds for your device to be read4. Open the \u201cIP Camera Tool\u201d Program5. You should see \u201cAnonymous\u201d and \u201cSubnet doesn\u2019t match, double click to change!\u201d6. Check the box \u201cObtain IP from DHCP Server\u201d This will automatically setup your device that is connected to your router. If you want to change the user/password and HTTP Port then feel free to.7. Your device should be connected. Congratulations. Now, you will be redirected to a website that you can view your camera. If you want to make this device wireless then continues to step 8.8. After you are on your website i.e 192.168.0.12/main.htm, enter username \u201cadmin\u201d and password blank (nothing here), click the Network tab and then \u201cWireless Lan Settings\u201d.9. Click the Scan button under \u201cWireless Network List\u201d10. Choose your network, key, and then click the submit button.11. Congratulations, you should now be able to use your camera wirelessly!\u25b6 SoftwareThe website includes tabs for \u201cLive Video, Multi-Device, Network, Audio Video, System, and Other\u201d.\u2022 Live video- Self explanatory\u2022 Multi-Device- Upgrade device firmware, restore to factory settings, or reboot device. I would assume this would be used for multi-camera view, but it is instead used for factory settings.\u2022 Network- Basic network settings, wireless LAN settings, ADSL settings, UPnP settings, DDNS Service settings\u2022 Audio video- Reversal, mirror. This has no audio settings, but may have settings when an audio source is connected.\u2022 System- Device settings, alias settings, Date and Time settings, User settings, PT Settings, (LED) indicator settings, backup and restore settings, log, and MSN settings. Nothing really to note here other than it includes \u201cMSN Settings\u201d; an instant massaging program that has been discontinued since 2013.\u2022 Other \u2013 Mail service settings, FTP server settings, Alarm settings. I like that this includes settings for FTP and mail services so you can always be updated of the images from your work.Under the vertical tabs are options to change \u201cResolution, Mode, Bright, and Contrast\u201d.\u2022 Resolution \u2013 160 x 120, 320 x 240, 640 x 480\u2022 Mode \u2013 50 Hz, 60 Hz, Outdoor\u2022 Bright \u2013 0 to 15\u2022 Contrast \u2013 0 to 6Under that is a circular compass to move the camera whichever direction you want.

Although the website doesn\u2019t look very appealing, it is very functional for the purpose of the camera. There are other supplemental software choices, such as Blue Iris, which use a very intuitive design, and give audio functionality, which the website doesn\u2019t provide, for compatible devices such as this one, but cost extra money. These supplemental pieces of software, however, do not provide full functionality that the website provides, such as horizontal, vertical patrol, and setting one of the nine preset positions. Whether you like it or not, you will need to use the website at least a few times.\u25b6 TestingI placed this camera in the kitchen, which is also the location of one of the entries of the house, for about a week. During this time, I noticed the camera did go offline a few times, which required me to reset the IP address of the camera, however these problems were very minimal. The picture is only 640 x 480, which isn\u2019t HD by any means, but you can make out images clearly; whether it would be in light or night vision. I have yet to see a reason for using the full pan and tilt features, unless I would be using this for business purposes. As said in software, you would not be able to hear the audio through the website, instead you would need to use supplemental software, such as Blue Iris to listen to your IP camera. The audio on this camera, using Blue Iris, was very clear. I could literally hear a pin drop from the next room. Unfortunately though, as of today, I have not figured out how to use the speaker that is included on the side of the camera. I would like to use this as an intercom system, since the camera has a speaker and microphone, but have yet to see this function. In the end, if you\u2019d be using this as a baby or child monitor, you would be able to tell if your children were in danger.\u25b6 Final ThoughtsThe camera is very functional. It is able to listen and monitor images clearly, but it isn\u2019t HD clear. If you are looking for an IP camera that can see individual hairs on your back then I\u2019d suggest looking elsewhere, however, if you are looking for a security camera or baby monitor that performs well, then I would definitely recommend this camera. Because of the functionality and performance, I give this IP camera a 5 star rating. My only room for improvement would be for the included speaker to function, but I don\u2019t find it a necessity.Pros:+ Able to be used during daytime or nighttime, with the ability to+ Includes several options such as presets, zoom in and out, and horizon patrol. These are great functional settings that optimize the camera\u2019s capabilities.+ Includes options for FTP and mail service so you can monitor your home while you are at work.+ Antenna is able to bend in 360 degree motion to give the best Wi-Fi connection.Cons:- Could not get included speaker to function.- Software design is functional but is frustrating to use and isn\u2019t very aesthetically pleasing; it is preferred to use supplemental software, which can be an additional cost.I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.", "Date": "April 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great product!

Setup was simple.  The installation CD had the program IP Camera Wizard which made setup very easy.  It took 5 minutes or less.Viewing was easy on my MacBook Pro Retina running OS X Lion.  The camera provided an unassigned ActiveX plugin for Internet Explorer.  I can install it but IE didn't permit me to run it since it was unsigned.  On my iPhone, I used CamViewer (a free app).They provide a DDNS host name but I also wish there was an option to turn it off.", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "HooToo Wireless Network IP Camera", "Author": "White-Out Reviews \"White-Out Reviews\"", "ReviewID": "R2NLJSU8RH297N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "HooToo Wireless Network IP Camera. I have added a link above so you can check it out at their site.Out of the box, this IP Network Camera is intense! I love the look of it and how it has a fully rotatable head. You have two options for the network, you can either have it wired in or wireless. I found that setting the IP Camera up on the hard wired connection was easier than if I tried with the wireless. The camera housing has plenty of IR so you can see just as well at night as you can during the day.Don't get too scared that when you plug in your IP Network Camera it starts to rotate like someone else is controlling it. This is just the camera calibrating itself to a centered position. Once you set it up and you can view from your computer, you can then access the controls to move the camera in any direction you want.I had some troubles getting it to work through Internet Explorer, so make sure you read the directions very thoroughly. My problem was thinking I had all the Active X settings enabled, but found after trying a few times that I needed to check those settings out. To be honest, it was my fianc\u00e9 who thoroughly read the instructions and gave me hope as she enabled all of the settings. After she enabled everything and we refreshed Internet Explorer we were set!The crisp color and the image quality of this camera is fantastic! When the lights are on, you can more than identify the perpetrator in your home, but you could also see who is sneaking all those beers from the fridge. The quality of this camera at night is just as good, so you can monitor day or night and verify that only the wild animals are roaming around while you are gone.You can have two way voice communication as well, which makes this device even more amazing for the price. As long as you have a microphone, you can project your voice to those people in your house without authorization. Eliminate the threat of a teenage party and broken glass all over the house, and if need be you can yell at those teenage kids all the way from France!Having this little device up and running definitely makes me feel more secure in our home. Being able to check out what's going on, no matter where as long as you have an internet connection makes this device ultimate. You can set it up so that it starts to record on a motion detection setting. Setup for any of these options are very easy, as they are given to you once you are logged into the IP Network Camera.The HooToo Wireless Network IP Camera only requires power to be connected to it, other than that it can function wirelessly. If you don't have a wireless router at this point and you still have a wired network, this will require an extra cable running from the camera. I think it looks absolutely fine in the corner up on the wall, and really isn't noticeable unless you glance over. The only thing to give this camera away, is the red light letting you know its functioning.I also just want to reiterate to read the instructions fully and thoroughly. Everything works perfect if you follow the right steps. If you think you know what you are doing and something isn't going right, consult the manual and take a breather.If you are looking for that little extra security at home, or you have been the victim of any break ins, or even if you are just paranoid of the zombie apocalypse, this is a great buy! I definitely give the HooToo Wireless Network IP Camera the White-Out stamp of approval. This camera gets the job done, and with grace. Having the camera connected to my network wirelessly I still don't have too much lag between what happens on camera and when it shows up on my live feed.You have plenty of options to make sure this Network IP Camera caters to you, so if you are interested in picking up that extra security, I say do it!", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "Julie M Farley", "ReviewID": "R17CIL1CEPMTBN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was really easy to set up < 30 min and we are not tech savvy.  the wireless is a great option for us as it allows us to move it all over the house (important with a new baby!).  it has great picture quality and audio capabilities.  my one recommendation would be the addition of a zoom option.overall very pleased - highly recommend!", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Blown Away!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R32UYRHYPU8MDP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is by far the best IP Camera I have used in this price range.  Actually, it's half the price I've paid for other IP Cameras that don't have near the features of the HooToo 210.  Installation was simple and straight forward.  I ran the utilities directly from the supplied disk and my camera was found and easily configured from there.  The Active X file could be a problem if your security settings are set too high. It's an easy fix on IE.  Currently using the camera as a crib cam.  The night vision works well and is easily adjusted by changing the brightness setting. The camera is larger than I thought it would be, but that is not an issue.  Pan and tilt funtions are smoothe and silent.  The 320 degree pan is impressive.  There is a setting to control the Pan/Tilt speed.  Built in DDNS saves a lot of time not having to configure or pay for a DDNS service. I use an Android device and monitor the camera using an app called Tiny IP Cam Pro, I think it was $3 and allows me to control every aspect of this camera.  The built in mic works good and I can monitor audio from anywhere. The only con I have is that the speaker on the camera is really loud and distorts easily. I've tried an external speaker, but still got the distortion.  As for the \"review request card\" it doesn't ask for a positive or 5 star review, it just ask's you to review the product.  The offer a 10% gift card for a review, but as far as I'm concerned they can keep it because they can't be making much on this camera at this price point.  The reverse side of the review request card has their 100% Satisfaction Guarantee and a zero defect statement.

If you are not a major tech head its amazingly confusing to set up and use. the directions that came with it are just about useless, I have the camera working but only on my home network, i have no web access to it because I have no idea and it wasnt mentioned in any of the books it came with or the description when i bought it about having a router set up for port forwarding, I never heard of it. after watching several vids on youtube and buying different router months later and its still not working, sent email to there tech support and all they said is its probubly a port forwarding issue, which i allready know. Its a nice camera and i wish i could get it to work but for now its a paperweight. There is a third party program for yet another 30 bucks that claims it will take care of port forwarding automatically that i have not tried because i dont know if it actually delivers on that promise. good luck.UPDATE: Within 24hrs of the posting of this review I was contacted via email from the company who has offered to in my opinion go above and beyond to help me with the problems i've had with this camera, this is unexpected and I'm hoping for the best, I will Update.", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good value for money", "Author": "Barcrofter", "ReviewID": "R1HTHDN336VH1H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "These little IP cameras are incredible value for money.  The Hootoo IP210F appears to be a clone of the Foscam camera at about the same price.  If you read the installation quick start carefully you should have no problem getting it installed and working either on a LAN or wifi connection.  To view the video remotely you will need to use a DDNS service and they provide one as part of the package but you can use any alternative.  The video works reasonably well over my 1 Mbit upload country internet link, I can pan in real time.  Remember this is an SD image not an HD.The camera is viewed using a web browser so it is OS neutral.  I use a mac, a win8 PC and also a cell phone browser.  The mobile app is tricky to use largely because the control buttons on the browser image are so small, but it can view the video and pan around under your control.One thing I couldn't figure out is how to link the camera to my MiCasaVerde home automation system, even tho it appears to be a clone of a Foscam camera that can be linked.I have it parked in a corner of my cabin allowing it to pan the interior.

The camera can be set up to send email alerts, with still photos, if it detects motion. This feature works well and I have been \"caught\" several times when I have forgotten to turn off the motion detection feature. As this is my main reason for purchasing the camera, I feel that it earns a four-star review.However, the camera is not without issues. The initial configuration did not go smoothly, and I was not able to use the setup wizard to detect and configure the camera. I wound up assigning a static IP address through my router so that I could access the configuration page.While the camera can be configured to upload still pictures to an FTP site when it detects motion, it will only record video if its interface is open on a computer at the time motion is detected. This is not a big issue, but it would be a good feature.HooToo provides a free iOS app to monitor the camera on your iPhone. However, the version I have only works when you are connected to the same network as the camera, so it's not very useful. I was able to find another generic IP camera app that accepted the DDNS site I set up to view the camera feed over the Internet.The camera has a built-in microphone and speaker designed to allow you to hear what is going on in your house and allow you to be heard. However, in testing this feature the volume levels on both ends of the conversation was so low that this feature is nearly useless. I've never used this after the initial testing.If you purchase this camera (or any other IP camera for that matter), make sure that your first step is to change the admin password! There are ways to search the Internet for IP cameras, and if you do not change your password your camera may be used to spy on you.I purchased the camera for $54.99, but it is now selling for $15 more.

features and specifications  as well as retail pictures on the boxThe camera does have an identifying mark on it which is the HooToo logo This camera is best affordable IP camera to get the job done inside  in my opinion...The camera does  come with an Instruction manual in English,quick guide , CD for mac and PC and comment card as well a CAT 5 cable and camera mounting kit this camera is the easiest to set up and  the Instruction booklet is very clear to help out the picture quality is better than most other cheaper IP cameras out there right now the night vision works better then other cameras I have it's just like looking through your own eyes I use a iPad app to manage the multi camera lookConclusion:So yes the camera is inexpensive , but is it even worth it? I would say yes if you want to check up on your front door or maybe your driveway  The camera  is very well made and does a night/day mode  where you can also see at night-time and even better then most cheeper night vision cameras  if you are looking for a camera with zoom this camera won't do that it will pan and tilt just as it says as well if you have alarm system you will also be able to hook this up to it I didn't find the need to mess with this there was also one big flaw with this camera which is the red indicator light on the front which transmits info to the router its directly in front so if you have it pointing on a driveway someone might be able to see this camera in the windowSo in all it's not bad for a budget IP camera but  if you want to have to have zoom  for this camera I would look into another camera otherwise you will like this budget cameraThe final score averages out to be a 10 out of 10, but that takes into account everything,", "Date": "May 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worth the price", "Author": "joecool_83", "ReviewID": "R3EN61AA06VH1E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera arrived as described.

I needed a PTZ camera to replace an old one.  One requirement is compatibility with the IR flood lights I recently started using.  This camera does it all.  After unpacking the unit and reading the manuals, I connected the camera and loaded up my router controls.  I designated the IP address and other ports, then loaded up the Blue Iris monitoring software.  I ran an update on the Blue Iris software and this particular camera was included in the list.  I entered the routing data and the camera started showing up immediately.  I edited a couple of the settings in the software and everything was up and running correctly.  The pan and tilt features on the camera are great.  Even the camera mic worked!  I do not have a mic on my computer to test the 2 way communication, but am sure it will work.  The software included with the camera is okay too.  If you are using this camera to monitor large areas at night, I do recommend the IR floods.  I got tired of having huge regular flood lights on full time, plus these can be powered by 12vdc.  The Blue Iris also lets you be very specific on motion triggers.  I just received this camera this evening and will include pictures and video in an update in a few weeks.

I bought two of these a couple months ago after my neighborhood was having multiple breaks-ins and thefts before the Christmas holiday. I decided to put up a couple of these cameras to give us some fighting power if our house was targeted for theft.The setup is fairly straight-forward, even if the directions don't make it seem so. Basically, hook this thing up to your network with the cable, plug it in, and run the little IP-Cam utility that comes with the cameras. This will find the camera's IP address on your network so you can find it. Once you know the address, navigate to it in your browser (ex: [...]), and this will allow you to change the settings in the camera to suit your home network, such as WiFi, DHCP, etc. Once all that is setup, just unplug the network cable from the camera and it will hook back up to your network wirelessly.One of the two cameras had a problem with the night vision. It just wouldn't come on, and all I could see was darkness. It seems that the IR lights were simply not coming on. So I contacted HooToo and they immediately sent another camera (didn't even ask for the old one to be returned, so now I use it with an external IR light bought from Amazon for ~$12). The replacement works great, so you can expect great customer service out of HooToo.The only complaint I have with these cameras is that they aren't so great in those times when the light is getting dim, but not dark enough to kick on the IR lights and filter. It seems like during these times, occasionally the camera will adjust it's brightness/color/etc to show the image, but then it goes away, and I haven't been able to find a good solution for this yet. That is why I only rated the cameras 4-stars.For those curious, I use my cameras as motion detectors while we are away from home. I don't use the built-in camera software to achieve this as it is too limited. I use iSpyConnect. It's free, runs on an always-on computer in your home, and will monitor the cameras for any movement whenever you have it enabled to do so. It also has a great mobile browser version that allows you turn the camera monitoring on and off. I just turn it on when we leave the house, and turn it back off when we get home (sometimes I forget and the cameras see us in the house and my phone starts blowing up because of the detected motion, haha). Upon motion detection, it will save a snapshot of the motion to my Dropbox account, so even if the intruder steals my laptop, the image is on the internet and I'll have it, same with the video recording. It's a pretty good solution, and is entirely free unless you want to pay for text alerts (hint: you can send a text to yourself using your carrier's email-text address, such as for Verizon, it would be 5551231234@vtext.com, similar for at&t;).And if the IR lights aren't wide-spread enough for you, think about getting an external IR light to mount beside the camera. I use one that is about $12 here on Amazon and it works pretty well. I use this outside so I can see further away at a wider angle.Hope this helps!

Let me be clear, you CAN access the camera and control it on your internal network easily with the installed software, but to access the \"worldwide\" link per se, you have to be on an outside network. It took me a while to figure that out. Maybe there is a way around it but that's as far as I got.

So click a button and the camera will adjust the pan/tilt to the configured location- responsiveness using ethernet is very good.  Not used just the wireless interface, being in the basement, hardwired would just provide better access than wifi.- resolution is respectable.  More expensive camera might provide better, but the detail is fine for monitoring a room.- Color representation is very good to my eye.  Watching youtube video's on other camera, the colors can be off by alot, this seems true to life for my untrained eye.Cons:- would like a wider viewing angle on the lens.  Granted the camera pans/tilt but would still prefer a wider viewing angle- in a very quite room, the movement of the camera could be heard. But with standard room/tv noise it is not likely to be noticed- the monitoring software does the job, but its not A+ grade software. the pan/tilt works fine from the PC, but the web insterface from an android device, doesn't work well.

I have an app on my ipad and also one on my android phone and I can use a browser on the PC to access this camera.

This was the first IP camera I've set up and if I do it again I think it will go quicker.Sound using the built in mic and speaker are working now with the app on my android phone (cost $2.99 to buy the pro version) and also on the PC using IE.  I didn't like having to reduce the security settings on IE to get the sound to work so I don't think I will keep that set up.

But the browser-based software seems to run fine under Chrome and FIrefox so I am satisfied with it.  I was able to get the product set up on my internal wireless in less than one hour.  Getting it to work from the Internet takes longer and is more dependent on your router than the camera, so I'm not going into that here.  Let me say though that the camera works fine over the Internet.The picture quality is better than I expected, and it works great both during the day and night.  I am especially impressed by the night vision quality.  Pan and tilt work great, and you can set it to \"patrol\" either horizontal or vertical.  I am still experimenting with alarms, but I think I have it set up so it will send me an email with an attached image if the camera detects motion.  I had to use my Google account to set up the automated mailing, but that was all free.  Date and time were synced up using a ntp server so I didn't have to do anything there.  All the software for control comes with the camera so I didn't have to buy anything for it.  I got only one camera, so I don't know how it will work with more than that.There were many things I could ding on this, but I did not try a firmware or software upgrade yet, and I was impressed enough otherwise that I am still giving a five-star rating.  First, it seems that passwords are limited to 12 characters and it will chop off the last few characters silently, very annoying.  Second, I would have preferred that security be improved on the admin account login credentials by default, especially after the articles about the recent baby monitor hijacking.  Third, I would have liked a zoom but the focus is good by default and I can change the resolution so I am OK with it as-is.Overall I am very happy with the purchase.", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is an impressive surveillance camera at a reasonable price ...", "Author": "D. Fowler", "ReviewID": "R26ICUY6V2IJI3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One thing that you need to keep in mind is that most of these security / baby monitors are not intuitive to set up.  If you find yourself a bit tech-challenged, it might be wise to have someone on hand to be able to help you with this camera even before you order it.  Even an IT can end up being a bit flustered with installation, although the HooToo was not one of them.  The Quick Installation Guide for the HT-Ip210F will get you started, but the manufacturer's websibe has more information to help guide you if you are going at it alone.With a quick five step process you can access the HooToo from you local network.  There are visuals in the installation guide that will enable you to be up and running quickly, including a visual that shows you what you should be seeing once you're configured properly.  Accessing from the Internet is where many people will have more difficulty.  I'd recommend heading to the recommended HooToo downloads and, if necessary, emailing support.  Things like configuring your router can be tricky, so if you can receive help for this from a friend, you'd do well to accept it.At this price point, I'm definitely impressed with the HooHoo's capabilities and what I'm seeing.  Many of the baby monitors I'm seeing out there and have used are quite a bit more expensive and this one is a bargain in comparison.  I've used several of them and one of the best features, the pan and tilt, comes at a cost in baby monitors.  There are several uses for these cameras and in fact, I have one relative who uses these as a chicken cam to make sure there are no predators lurking in the coop (I kid you not).  If you want a versatile, multi-faceted/use pan and tilt camera, I'd recommend trying out the HooToo.WHAT's IN THE BOX:-1 x Camera-1 x Antenna-1 x Adapter-1 x Network Cable-1 x Manual-1 x CD-ScrewsSPECIFICATIONS:Model:  HT-Ip210F (IR Filter)IMAGE SENSOR:Image Sensor:  1/4\" CMOS SensorDisplay Resolution:  640 x 480 Pixels (300,000 Pixels)Lens:  F:3.6mm, F:2.0, Built-in IR FilterMinimum Lux Required:  0.5lm for Normal OperationLENS:Lens Type:  Glass LensViewing Angle: 90\u00b0AUDIO:Input:  Built-in Microphone / One Channel Audio InputOutput:  One Channel Audio OutputAudio Compression:  ADPCMVIDEO:Image Compression:  MJPEG FormatImage Frame Rate:  30fps (VGA). 30fps (QVGA)Resolution:  640 x 480 (VGA), 320 x 240 (QVGA)Flip Mirror Images:  Vertical / HorizontalFrequency:  50Hz, 60Hz, OutdoorVideo Parameters:  Brightness, Saturation, Contrast, HueCOMMUNICATION:Ethernet Interface:  Built-in 10/100 Mbps, Auto MDI/MDIX, RJ-45Supported Protocol:  TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS, DHCP, PPPoE, SMTP, FTP, SSL, TFTP, NTP, NTP, ARP/RARP, NFS, RTSP, RTP, RTCPWireless Standard:  IEEE 802.11b/g/nData Rate:  802.11b:  11Mbps (Max.), 802.11g:  54Mbps (Max.)  802.11n:  150Mbps (Max.)Wireless Security:  WEP & WPA WPA2 EncryptionPHYSICAL:Pan/Tilt Angle:  Pan 320\u00b0, Tilt 120\u00b0Alarm Input:  One Channel On/Off InputAlarm Output:  One Channel On/Off Relay OutputInfrared Lights:  Built-in LED Illuminators for Night Vision up to 20mPOWER:Power Supply:  Dc5V/2.0APower Consumption:  7 Watts (Max.)ENVIRONMENT:Operating Temperature:  0\u00b0C - 55\u00b0C (32\u00b0F - 131\u00b0F)Operating Humidity:  20\u00b0 - 85\u00b0 (Non-condensing)Storage Temperature:  -10\u00b0C - 60\u00b0C (-14\u00b0F - 140\u00b0)Storage Humidity:  0\u00b0 - 90\u00b0 (Non-condensing)PC REQUIREMENTS:CPU:  2.0GHZ or above (Suggested 3.0 GHZ)Memory:  256MB or Above (Suggested 1.0GB)Display Card:  64M or AboveSupported OS:  Microsoft Windows 2000/XP/Vista 7/Apple/MacWARRANTY:1 YearSample provided for review.", "Date": "August 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Somewhat complex to set up, but good functionality", "Author": "Comdet", "ReviewID": "R15X98OYCYCSWK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I want to preface my review with the statement that this is the first IP camera I ever set up. So, some of my initial struggles could very well be due to my lack of experience with router configuration and DDNS service.The overall build quality of the camera seems pretty good. The plastic housing seems sturdy and the overall design is attractive (at least, attractive as far as IP cameras go).The included instructions are both terse and poor. It didn't give me the warm fuzzies about the installation process from the get-go. But, a more complete, and pretty well-done manual is available on the HooToo site. I would strongly encourage IP camera neophytes to go there and get the manual before starting the install.The actual installation process became more clear once I got into it. I had a hiccup getting the software installed on my PC (Win 7 32 bit) in that it hung up during the install requiring a reboot. This may have been due to my anti-virus software (Avast) which I forgot to suspend, as recommended in the install instructions. Attempt #2 with Avast suspended went through to completion.The actual functionality of the camera is pretty good. Decent video that is clear. Granted, it is a low-end camera so don't expect to see images in HD, but the resolution was more than acceptable.What was less than decent was the wi-fi range. It was fine in the same room, but trying to go further proved problematic at best. That's not a concern for me since my preferred camera location makes it easy to hard wire it to the router, but if you're planning on using this in a wireless configuration be prepared for potential range challenges.Overall video performance at this price point merits five stars. I'll knock it down one star due to WiFi issues. I won't take any stars away due to installation challenges since experienced users may not need as much hand-holding as I did, but if you are a novice, set aside a good chunk of time to get this up and running.[Sample provided for review]", "Date": "August 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Remote controlled pan and tilt home security camera", "Author": "Nuknuk", "ReviewID": "REFV9L4ZU9MBV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera can do almost anything.  It has motion detection, wired or wireless, night vision, email notification, app enabled, access through a regular browser, two way audio for communication, and you can physically tilt and pan the camera through your remote location. Indoor only.Installation:First, you would need to directly connect the camera via an ethernet cable to your router to set it up.  After setup, you can transfer the camera anywhere in the house without the cable - now you are wireless.  The camera came with an installation CD, wall/ceiling mount with screws, ethernet cable, AC power adapter and a brief instruction manual.  I first tried to set it up myself.  The camera can be setup up either with Windows or  Mac OS.  Although  I have an iMac with Windows Home Premium and Mountain Lion using VMWare, tech support recommended to use the Windows version as an easier alternative.  I installed the CD and an App through HooToo's website but either way it could not detect any camera through my network.  That was when I contacted HooToo customer service.To make a long story short, my Ooma telephone which is directly connected to my modem became the main issue.  My internet goes trough Ooma first before going to my Apple Extreme router.  It would be easier if the router is directly connected to the modem instead. At first, my main suspect was the Apple 802.11ac router because it came out just a couple of months ago - I was thinking of compatibility issue.  Raymond, the tech support person, was able to make a quick fix (by the way, this guy really knows what he is doing). Now I can connect to the camera at home through a remote PC or my phone.Phone App:For the smartphone app, CamViewer for IP Webcams by John McKerrell, a free app (2.99$ if you want to add audio functionality) is great. I can talk to my kids while at work using my phone.  One way audio was very clear. You can hear everything that is happening in the room.  Two-way audio has some feedback interference, but I can still communicate with my kids.You can adjust the resolution up to 640 x 480 via remote location.  You can snap pictures and also pan and tilt around the room with the camera's built-in motor. Overall, this is a nice home security camera that doesn't cost a lot with lots of features.Cons:- setup can be a snap or complex depending on your setup.

I do have some observations that I might have liked to be a little better but overall I think it is more than worth its price tag.I would love to see a free mobile app that provides sound features.  Since this camera has 2 way audio it would have been nice to not have to purchase an app capable of that since it is a great feature.  That being said the app was only $2 or $3 so it wasn't too bad.I think the focus could be a little sharper but that is a lot to ask of a .3 megapixel camera and at this price point.The other thing that I would like to change, and this applies to all cameras of this type not just this one, is an easy way to extend the power supply wire.  These cameras work great wireless and so it would be nice to be able to extend the power supply because often they could and would be mounted some distance from an outlet.  Maybe instead of a fixed wire transformer it could come with a transformer with 2 screws for connecting to the wire then it would be easy to extend. Along with a power connection with 2 screws on the camera just like the i/o and alarm connections so you could run any wire for power without the barrel connector.  Just a thought.  :)The software which comes with the camera works well and is quite functional.Infrared night vision so far works quite well.Pan and tilt sometimes seems to stick a bit, not sure if that has to do with connection or actual device, will have to play around with it some more to figure that out.Also a bonus is that it comes with its own Dynamic DNS address which is quite convenient and saves some hassle and money.Overall I am very pleased with the camera and would suggest it to friends.", "Date": "July 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "it works perfect.", "Author": "mrghm", "ReviewID": "RPPR8BTCP2QLT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought it for my house surveillance ,it is so nice & working perfectly.installation was not so easy but it was OK for me  with using the booklet.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hootoo delivers for the price!", "Author": "peterb", "ReviewID": "R19RWIC75IRGG1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There may be cameras with clearer pictures and with more features, however this Hootoo camera is an amazing value with wireless IP, pan, and tilt all for less than $70.I am reasonably competent technically and was able to set it up both wired and wireless for local viewing on my network, however, I just could not get the factory provided DDNS external web site to work.  I then set up another external DDNS web site through NO-IP.com, but couldn't get that to work either.Finally, I gave up and called the technical support number fearing the worst, particularly when the phone rang and rang forcing me to leave a voice mail.  Too my pleasant surprise, I received a call back from tech support gentleman named Raymond.  He was very knowledgeable and easy to work with.  I gave him access to my Vista laptop and he configured only a few settings, including correcting to use the proper ID at NO-IP - that may have been my mistake -- your login email for NO-IP account is not your account ID -- you will be able to confirm what you set up as account ID in your NO-IP account settings and then use that value in the DDNS box provided on Hootoo camera software.This was working great until I attempted to run camera over the internet (not local) on a Windows 7 laptop.  It seems the more recent versions of IE block the ability to install the software the camera needs.  I emailed Raymond in tech support once more and he walked through some IE configuration changes that were required for the later versions of IE.Again, I am reasonably competent, but sure there are individuals more technical that could research and figure this out themselves.  It was just comforting to know that Hootoo has good tech support, because they will likely save you time getting it all configured.I know this is an indoor camera, but I have it in a covered outdoor patio in my vacation home and love the fact I can see what things look like outside remotely.I don't think you can go wrong at this price and I give 5 stars for the tech support I received!", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "For the price it's great!", "Author": "The real Amazon fan", "ReviewID": "R1FD5Z5Z4HV0GB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can save my pan/tilt settings on IP Camera Viewer app just like how I can with my other IP cameras in the house.

stellar customer support from HooToo.  I was blown away with their incredibly friendly, helpful, USA based customer support team.  HooToo had provided me a sample of this product in exchange for a fair and honest review on Amazon.  I was a little leary about setting this guy up but knew it would be great if I could get it to work and HooToo's Customer Support Team reassured me that they could help me if I ran into any difficulty.  I have Verizon Fios, a home Mac running OS X Mavericks and a Windows Laptop running Windows 7.  I also have very little experience with the IT background that you will need to do this yourself but want to share my experience.  If you want to see the highlights and my review of the camera go down to the PROs and CONs section.I unpacked the camera and didn't really know where to get started.  Luckily, HooToo provided a Quick Installation Guide so that is where I started.  First you plug in the included RJ-45 ethernet cable to your router and provide power to it.  Next you take the CD that came with the camera and load it into your computer.  I first put it into my Mac and was clueless and could not find the right file to get it going.  I decided to give it a try in my Windows 7 laptop and had a lot better success with that - so that is my first tip - set this thing up in Windows if you can.  Once you install and run the HooToo IP Camera Tool you should see your IP camera's IP address on your network.  Double click on the IP address and you will go to that IP address on your web browser.  You will be prompted for a username and password - put in admin and leave the password blank and log in.  Here is tip number two - use Chrome.  At first I used Internet Explorer 9 and had all sorts of issues with the ActiveX controls and getting it to work.  I tricked out all of the settings and set my PC to the lowest security settings and finally got it to work.  Once I found the Chrome workaround I went back and reset all of my IE values to their default values.You finally get to see the camera image, get to play around with the pan and tilt functions and get a sense of accomplishment.  However, your sense of accomplishment will be short lived because you need to set this up to be a wireless camera.  Have no fear, HooToo customer support is here.  This is about as far as I could get on my own.  I called HooToo and spoke to Raymond and he saved the day for me.  After conversing a little bit, I decided it would be easier to download some software so he could hop onto my computer and get this camera set up.  That was tip number three because this makes it incredibly easier to get across the finish line.  I answered all of Raymond's questions and he just went to town on my computer.  We got hung up because I had never logged into my router before.  I called Verizon Fios customer support - eventually they had me hit the reset button on my router - here is the ironic part - I needed Internet Explorer to be able to re-enter my new password.  I called Raymond back and he set me all up.  I told him I wanted to set it up on my iPhone as well as be able to view it remotely.  Raymond then proceeded to set up port forwarding on my router and walked me through the whole thing as he was doing it.  Once I was all set up he cleared up my last issue, which was using Internet Explorer with the HooToo website.  I couldn't get the wireless settings pop-out tabs to show and when I logged in using Chrome - you guessed it, it worked - tip number 4.  So use Windows to install IP Camera Tool, use Chrome to view the image, use HooToo customer support if you get stuck and use Chrome to toggle the wireless settings on the HooToo web site.Yes, the camera and its features are important but so is the ease-of-use in setting it up for the novice.PROS*640x480 at 15 fps, 320x240 at 30 fps*Pans/Tilts*A great value as far as features versus cost*Night vision*Motion Detection - Can set up e-mail alerts and snap photos upon motion activation*Two-way audio - so you can talk back and forth*Very quiet panning and tilting - it does have a blinking red light, which some users will want but I turned it off from the HooToo web page*Comes with CD, mounting bracket and screws, Quick Installation Guide, User's Manual, RJ-45 cable, power adapter*50 Hz, 60 Hz, Outdoor modes*Optimized MJPEG video compression for transmission*Wifi 802.11 b/g*Outstanding customer support - Makes all the difference in the world for a novice setting one of these upCONs*Night vision is not as good as an outdoor camera*No zoom, but I knew this wasn't a Pan/Tilt/Zoom camera to start out with*Learning curve - make sure you have some time on your hands when you unpackaged this and go for it*Blinking red light but this can be turned on or off*Setup was pretty tricky for a novice.  I had no idea where to go on the included CD on my Mac.  I eventually used the Quick Installation Guide and Windows to get the IP Camera Tool program installed.  HooToo can do a better job of walking the novice through this.  They sent me some links on Youtube but here is what I think they should do.  I think they should make the CD such that you select whether you are installing it on a Mac or Windows.  From there, you watch a series of videos that show you how to get the camera installed.  I think that will provide a lot of value for the user because it will make his or her life easier.  I am talking about full videos from unpacking to port forwarding.  I know that setup will be different on everyone's network but seeing someone else do it would build some confidence in the user.  There could also be different videos for the different types of installs - all the way through from either a Mac or a Windows machine.  I think they could do a better job with the Quick Start Guide as well, it could be bigger and include more explanations of what you are going to do and how you are going to do it.  It needs to walk you through the process better.As far as Apps for your iPhone or Android phone, I found Surveillance Pro for Foscam (this is a generic IP camera and a lot of the Foscam Apps will work this camera just fine).  I also found uFoscam: 2way Audio & AV Record worked pretty good as well - it can crash on IOS 7 although they are working to fix that.The best thing about this camera is the excellent value.  You really get a lot of bang for your buck.  The HooToo customer support team should alleviate any concerns that you might have about not getting this camera to work.  Even though I was provided a sample for testing I would not hesitate to get another camera from them on my own because I know they would help get it to work for me.  There are no real cons here really for me...People need to remember that a HD cam will also chew up a lot of bandwidth - 640 x 480 is plenty for me.  If you are looking at getting this or a baby monitor, get this, it is a lot more flexible and when your baby gets older you can use it for lots of other things, like watching them play in the basement when you are upstairs.  It also has the two way talk as well as the ability to be viewed remotely.  So if you are going to spend the money you could spend half as much and get a whole lot more for your money.I was provided a sample by the manufacturer in exchange for a fair and honest review.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "3 months of excellent proformance so far", "Author": "T.

If I was new to ip cams- I would use the included setup CD. You need to let I.E. install the Active-X software in order to use the cam with I.E., if you're going to use it with Firefox- you need to let the cam install it's sw via server push mode. Both browsers work- but I.E. works better as with most all ip cams.This model (HT-IP210F) has the 3.6mm lens rather than the common 6mm lens found on some other models. That means you get a much wider field of view with this camera vs the cameras with a 6mm lens. Our old 6mm lens ip cam only covered part of our parking lot at work. This model with the 3.6mm lens has a wide enough view to cover the whole lot without panning.This model also has the IR cut filter that automatically kicks in during daylight conditions so you get actual blue skies and green trees and grass rather than purple trees/grass with cams that don't have the IR cut filter.This model also pans a full 320\u00b0 which makes it easier to mount vs the common 270\u00b0 cams- I have ours actually mounted 90\u00b0 to the window for fitment but due to it's 320\u00b0 pan range- I can still see full right and left out the window.The base of this model seems much heavier than previous ip cams- helps keep it anchored.New slimmer design seems a bit more sturdy and heavier too compared to most generic ip cams.I had the opportunity to contact HooToo support. I was pleasantly surprised in how responsive and helpful they were. Better than the company that makes our hi-def security cams that cost 5x as much as the HooToo ip cam.Overall I can't see why anyone would spend more on the other big name in ip cams when HooToo is considerably less money with a good product and good customer support.", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Product and Great Tech Support", "Author": "jesus caballero", "ReviewID": "R2I25Q2CCDDNPI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I got the camera, the first thing i did was drop it to the concrete floor! and after a pretty hard hit worked perfectly. then I had a hard time connecting the camera to the router and tech support Raymond Kwan from Sunvalley-tek Customer Care did a great job setting everything up for me via remote connection!FIVE STAR PRODUCT + FIVE STAR CUSTOMER SERVICEWILL DEFINITELY BUY MORE CAMERAS!", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "HooToo 210 IP Camera", "Author": "ed775", "ReviewID": "R1J5PEBZU1WBVM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this camera in March of 2013 and set it up for both local router and internet access (using IP Cam Viewer).

At this point, I'm willing to accept that the problems with the first unit is not indicative of all units.  Based on the second unit and the outstanding customer service I received I've changing my initial review of one star to five stars and would recommend Sunvalleytek as a top notch seller and HooToo as a solid product.**It was a challenge but I managed to set the camera on my network (wired and wireless) and everything appeared to be working great until I attempted to pan.  The pan motor (left and right) does not fully move when not on a flat surface.  Mounting the camera at any angle, even with the provided mount and it will not rotate/pan properly.  When I put an ear close to the camera I can hear the servo motor trying to engage and pan but the camera won't move.However, since I'm using the camera primarily as a static baby camera I could have dealt with the lack of the pan working properly.  The real issue is (and the one I simply can't over look and why its getting 1 star) is when the CAMERA RANDOMLY REBOOTS.  It has a constant power source, solid network connection and often (like 5 times/cycles in 20 minutes of watching my child) it will turn off, turn on again after a few seconds and then go through its usual 30 second boot test of pan/tilt.  Then (and even more frustrating) when the camera is testing after booting it does not get \"stuck\" panning, which makes no sense to me!When the camera works like it should the aspects that initially drew me to buying this camera like image quality, value, connectivity, IR cut, etc. are great, outstanding even, but having it randomly rebooting on me is infuriating and honestly a deal breaker and satisfaction killer.

Shortly after my complaint, we got a replacement of the device. So far, I have done a full test on the new device. Here is an update from my last review after we got the replacement.The new device has much improvement than previous one in most of the aspects even they have the same model. I also noticed that the firmware of this device is newer than the latest one published in Hootoo.com. Maybe this makes the big difference, or the last device we got was a defect one.Pros:1. Wireless connection:  For the new device, it access distance is greater than 30 feet and there are 3 walls between the device and wireless router. I tried to put the device outdoor and the connection was still great even there is a brick wall between. The access distance is much longer than that of the last device.2. Night vision. This device also works great when there is little or no light indoor and outdoor (also 30+ feet away from wireless router). This is amazing to me. And it is much, much better than that of last device.3. The quality of live video is better that of last one. If this can be improved (to 720p or so), that will be better. I know the price of the product will also be increased accordingly.4. The Alarm Service and Mail Service work as expected and easy to setup. 6 images will be sent in each Upload Interval to your email account when a motion is detected. This feature allows you to get a real-time notification when you are not watching the Live Video while away from home and you have access to your email (on mobile or office computer) and email notification is turned on.5. Live Video through Internet access (remote access while away from home) works as well as it works in home computer on home network.6. The new device has been up and running for more than two weeks. So far, the Live Video has been working continuously without problem.7. The IPCamClient software works with the new device.Cons:1. The IPCamClient software has some bug. The left and right arrows on the dial panel on the GUI are reverted, which is opposite to what shows on the Firefox. These buttons on the dial pans on different software should operate in the same way. Also those arrows do not work smoothly on Firefox and IPCamClient.2. When light is not evenly distributed in a place/room, the live video does not provide good result (blurry/snow) as it does in a place with evenly light, or without light, or outdoor.3. No logout function can be found yet. Logout function is needed if the computer and mobile phone used for monitoring is accessible by others for some reasons.So far, I like this IP camera. It is much better that previous one. It would be even better if above Cons could be fixed. I would recommend this device to others.=================================Previous reviewI chose this IP camera based on the average customer reviews. From my experience, this product is not worth to own. I don't understand how this product could get so high review rating.Here are the reasons why I don't like this camera:1. With wireless connection, The IP camera works within the distance of Ethernet cable from wireless router. But, it stops taking live video in both Firefox Server Push mode and VLC mode after the camera is moved to 15 ~ 20 feet away from router. The live video window shows complete dark. Some of my home computers are much further away from the wireless router and they connect to the Internet without problem.2.  Live video is very blurry when it works and is far away from what HooToo claims \"high quality digital video\", and it does not have real 640*480 quality. In the place with little light, the live video is almost useless. Foscam FI8910W has higher quality video than HooToo HT-IP210F in 640*480 resolution.3.  Does not work with 64 bit IE at all.4. IPCamClient software does not work even the IP camera is connected to the router with a Ethernet cable and when live video works in Firefox.5. Nowhere in the document says how to make static IP to work wireless with a router. The static IP is needed for an IP camera in a home network when accessing the IP camera from Internet.It wasted time.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Broken returned for RMA and not posted", "Author": "Randall J Joslin", "ReviewID": "R18JI85PGKKTWS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Got this thing and first thing out of the box and installed all it would do is point straight up in the air and swivel left and right.
