It works great.  The resolution is perfect for aim/focus.  The hand held size is great.  The grip also fits nicely into one of the tool holes on the top step of a ladder, which comes in handy when on top of a 12' ladder and you need to set it down to make some adjustments.  Over all a good device for a great price.  I'm going to get my office to buy one of these for each of our techs since they are so cheap when compared to other cctv monitor handsets.  It doesn't do PTZ or Voltage, but will pass 12vdc to power up a camera if you need.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "great product for cctv installers", "Author": "jesus", "ReviewID": "R295T9KIUQXJNW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just purchased this product last week starting using it  right away. it works great. I am an installer and i had used a more expensive test Monitor but i didnt like the fact that it works on double AA batteries. this AGP product uses a rechargeble battery pack . its really easy to use. i would give a Five Star if it would come with a BNC to BNC patch cord cable.
