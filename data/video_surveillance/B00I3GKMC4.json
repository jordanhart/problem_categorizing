{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Incomplete firmware", "Author": "Kevin McMurtrie", "ReviewID": "R2IJ6GNPTD0O1W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Tech support may be able to save this product but for now it's looking like it must be returned.  What makes this camera stand out from others is its ability to run stand-alone, and that's not working for me.  I can't get it to keep a working SMB connection to either a Drobo FS or a MacOS 10.6.8 Server.  It works with the Drobo FS for a few minutes then reports that the storage is \"uninitialized\".  It won't talk at all to MacOS 10.6.8.  Both servers report socket resets for the SMB connection.  The camera's logging only works while it has a network disk so there's no way to debug why it's dropping the connection.  These failures happen whether it's recording or not.  Once storage fails the camera remains inactive until reboot, which is not acceptable.It should also be noted that this camera doesn't really use a web interface.  It requires a browser plugin for MacOS X or Windows.  Overall the web interface is a clumsy mix of settings that submit instantly, require hitting a submit button, and require a lengthy restart.  Some combinations of settings don't seem to make any sense.  For example, you can set the exposure time to be much longer than needed for the frame rate.  I'm guessing that it means maximum exposure time?  The H.264 settings are vague and not described anywhere.  The manual offers no more help than saying a few words about what the sections mean.RTSP seems to work.  QuickTime doesn't understand the authentication challenge but VLC works perfectly.Image quality is comparable to a very old cell phone but with good low light performance.  The image is noisy under all conditions, including long exposures, unless noise suppression is turned up to maximum.  This noise suppression causes shimmering in high detail areas and ghostly blurring of motion.  Night mode mechanically removes an IR filter and turns on IR illumination LEDs.I don't really need the web interface and pretty pictures so I will upgrade this to 4 stars if tech support eventually gets back to me with a fix for network storage.  Since the camera can't display any logs, there's nothing that I can do except say that it doesn't work.", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great outdoor night capable camera", "Author": "Flip", "ReviewID": "RE8KXNCRAYYYQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The TRENDNet TV-IP311PI works great for my needs.  I wanted a camera with good resolution, outdoor and night time capable for a reasonable price.I only record to a NAS so I can't comment on any issues with using it as a standalone camera.  It is incredibly rugged and surprisingly compact.  I haven't tested it through all that the out-of-doors has to throw at it but based on its construction and performance this far, I can't see any reason why mounting one of these under an eave wouldn't last through anything.The setup wasn't as easy as some of the other TRENDNet cameras for me, but if you have a basic understanding of networks, it should be simple enough.  As with all TRENDNet cameras I've used, it ships with an old firmware that should be updated first thing.The quality of the video is amazing for the price tag.  I was shocked at the low-light performance (even without the IR filter); the dynamic range on this camera can't be beat for this price.  I'm not quite sure if the advertised 25m nighttime range is accurate, most manufacturers seem to stretch this a bit, but with some decent ambient lighting, it is good enough.  The FOV works great for my needs and doesn't give as much distortion as I would expect, although it is there.If this camera came in an 802.11 model with PTZ for double or less, I would not hesitate to pick up several more.  As it stands now, I will probably be buying another one or two for some different look angles.", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00I3GKMC4"}}
