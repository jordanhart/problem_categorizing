{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Easy, Functional, Works", "Author": "The Amazonian", "ReviewID": "R2V6UUT2K6SF4X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I selected this camera setup after looking around and learning a little bit. I need 4 cameras so this fit the bill. It is easy to install as long as you don't have any complex wiring runs. I didn't use the included 60ft wires as most of my runs were longer than that so I used bulk siamese RG-59(18-2) and terminated it myself.The cameras look nice installed and provide decent image quality. The daytime color images and IR night images serve my purpose of just wanting/needing to see what's going on while I'm away. The image clarity meets my needs.Play back is simple although I have yet to explore most of the setup options or connect to the DVR via the internet.The DVR runs a little warm, but has worked well so far.

The recording quality is very good for the price. I am having trouble networking the system and that is the reason I didn't give it 5 stars. I have contacted their support people and when I can carve out the time it takes to go through the set up, I know it will work fine.  Overall,  VERY happy with this.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worst directions ever.", "Author": "No", "ReviewID": "R28IL3MDC3E6DN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The instructions that come with this are horrible. Good luck trying to update the smartviewer also. Have fun trying to hook it to your network. The directions in pdf format are more confusing than helpful and look like they were poorly translated to English. To be fair the cameras and dvr seem ok, but what is the point if you can't view your feed online remotely? Better learn about port forwarding, static isp's, ddns, tcp protocols and the like before you attempt to set this up.
