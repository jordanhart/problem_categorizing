{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I really wanted to like this thing", "Author": "quadclops", "ReviewID": "R3JKSKDEDGW7SI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have purchased tons of stuff from amazon over the years, and this is the first time I have felt inclined to write a review, so bear with me.  So, right up front, I tried hard to really like this thing.  I have been wanting to get it for some time now, as I have two 1080 HD Dahua security cameras (for those that don't know, Q-See cameras and NVRs are just re-branded Dahua), which are great cameras for the most part, but that's a review for another product.Let me first explain where I was before I got this NVR:I have been using the FTP functionality on the cameras for about a year now, saving off the video footage to my PC.  The problem was that it was REALLY bogging down my system with the constant writing to the secondary hard drive in my machine (the cameras don't have the best motion-sensing capabilities, so I had motion detection set so high that it was almost full-time record) at about 6000Kbps constant bit rate.This is when I decided to save up for this thing and I was really excited when I got it.  My friend (we are both engineers, by the way) had just ordered the 16-channel NVR and seemed to have mixed emotions after about a week's worth of using it.  He has 5 Dahua cameras and we both did the FTP thing for the last year or so.  I got the 8-channel, because I didn't think I would ever have more than 6 cameras or so.Now that you know where I am coming from, let me summarize a few points on this thing:The good:1. Like any NVR, this thing is completely stand-alone and does a great job recording the video to the disk.  It has TONS of options and you can tweak you camera settings from the NVR itself.  As far as the recording goes, I couldn't be happier.2. You can use the \"Q-See QC View\" iPhone and iPad apps to view the cameras, playback recorded video from the NVR, etc. (more on this later).3. The model I purchased comes with a built-in 4-port PoE (Power over ethernet) switch, which is VERY handy if you don't already have a PoE switch for your cameras.  This necessitates two power supplies (12V for the NVR itself, and 48V for the built-in PoE switch), which are both included, of course.4. HDMI and RGB output.  I have it hooked up to both my TV through HDMI (I am actually using a BriteView wireless HDMI transmitter in there, too and it still works great) and to a secondary computer monitor next to the NVR at the same time and that seems to work great as well, though I have not tried having them both on at the same time, but I don't think that it would make much of a difference.5. The NVR finds the cameras really easily.  If you have the cameras plugged directly into the NVR (using one of the four the PoE ports), it only takes as much time to find them as it takes the camera to boot up.  Really easy.The neutral:1. A little fan noise.  Not something to be TOO concerned with, but the NVR does have a built-in fan that can be a little annoying if you are sitting in the same room as the thing.  It's not really loud, but just a little annoying unless you have the NVR tucked away in a server room of sorts, which is what I did.2. The user interface was obviously designed by engineers (and, like I said, I AM one).  It's not SUPER ugly (though they probably could have prettied it up some), it's just hard to navigate through.  Like I mentioned above, there are TONS of options for this thing, and they decided to make all of these options available to you, which is good, but can be a little overwhelming.3. This NVR may change settings on your cameras without warning you.  Make sure you have your network settings set up EXACTLY how you want it before you plug your cameras into the PoE switch on the back of the NVR.  I was using an external PoE switch at first and found the cameras easily with the NVR on the network.  I had them configured with static IPs (192.168.x.x) for easy access.  All of that changed when I moved them from my external PoE switch to the built-in switch on the NVR (which has a default gateway of 10.1.1.1).  The switch on the NVR is completely separate from the rest of your network.  In other words, I had my NVR's IP set to 192.168.0.200, for example.  The switch is still in the 10.1.x.x space.  So, when I moved my cameras, they were re-assigned a 10.1.x.x IP....and it was static.  I couldn't access the cameras directly from my network anymore because they were now on a different network.  Sure, I could probably change my subnet masks to be able to access them again, but it was just really annoying.  Even after moving them back to my external PoE switch, they were still inaccessible.  Just be aware of this.The bad:1. Try accessing this NVR from anything but IE and you're out of luck.  IE?  Really?  C'mon, guys!  I am even able to access most of the functionality on my Dahua cameras directly with the iPad, but not the NVR?  C'mon.  Also, you have to have the RIGHT VERSION of IE to be able to have it work smoothly, according to the different forums my buddy read.  I am still running IE9, and am worried that if I upgrade to 10 that I might lose all functionality, just like with other browsers.2. Invisible files?  What the...?  So, when I was saving off my video to my PC directly via FTP, it saves off the data into files that you can play back with some Dahua software, which was really nice, but has it's own drawbacks, of course.  Anyway, Q-See claims that the NVR can save off these data files to your computer, and, when looking through the user interface (with IE, of course), sure enough, you can.....sort of.  I, apparently, was not using the correct VERSION of IE to download these files from the NVR to my computer, because as soon as they were downloaded, for the life of me, I could not find them with Windows Explorer.  I went back and tried to download the file again, but the Save As dialog showed that it was already there!!  What the...?  Back to Windows Explorer.  Nothing.  Do a windows search for the file.  Nothing.  Back to the Save As dialog?  Still there?!  That makes no sense!  Hidden files?  Nope.  Permission issues?  Nope.  I could ONLY access the files locally by right-clicking on them in the stupid Save-As dialog.  Perhaps someone can shed some light on this one?3.  Ok, at least I am able to watch the playback from my bed on the iPad....wait, did the app just freeze?  Huh.  Must have been a glitch.  Close the playback window, open it again.  Looks like it's playing fine aga---what?!  Again?!  Over and over and over again, the iPad app freezes during playback (this is not even mentioning the frequent 'out of memory' messages you get from the app on a regular basis, but that also happens in Dahua's IDMSS iPad app -- which makes sense -- they are essentially the same).  And I am not saying it freezes after 5 minutes -- try every 10 seconds of playback.  Extremely frustrating if you are trying to look for footage from earlier.The wrap-up:Overall, this NVR is just not quite ready for prime time.  It shows a LOT of potential, and I love that it will record 1080 video from multiple cameras, but accessing the video after it is recorded is just too much.  I had hoped there would be firmware updates or something to address these issues, but I am seeing these issues mentioned in posts from a year ago and I still see no new firmware to fix it -- after nearly a year of them knowing about the bugs.  I am regretfully returning mine to Amazon due to these major flaws.  I may just end up buying a NAS and enabling an FTP server on it to store my data.  Sad day, indeed.  I really wanted to like this NVR.Oh, and in case you think it might be just my NVR?  My friend had the exact same issues with his.  It's just not quite ready for prime time.  If you have solutions for any of these above issues (and please don't tell me to format the hard drive in the NVR -- I've already read about all of that), I would love to hear them!  Perhaps I would then keep it after all.", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good product, has more potential", "Author": "TK \"TK\"", "ReviewID": "RPWE4VO41DZVY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the QC808 to use with several of the Q-See 720p bullet cams. Set-up was fairly easy and it found the cameras no problem. I'm using a remote POE switch instaed of the onboard POE. Playback is fine and the multi cam screens are very nice.Things that need improvment:1. Remotely logging into the NVR has a different UI then when at the NVR with the mouse. The remote NVR interface is complicated and the setting names don't match what on the local UI. Its confusing and hard to use. Would be nice if the remote UI was the same as the local UI.2. No way to set up a differnt event email subject per channel. Becuase of this I'm disabling the email on the NVR and using the cams to send emails. Just using NVR for video.3. Its confusing to know what settings on the NVR override the on camera settings.4. The NVR password is only 6 characters max.  The cameraes can do over 11.5. Can't do a config back-up onto the hard drive. Need to use a USB stick.6. Manual lacks details on some of the settings. Not sure what they do.7. Some of the Event settings on the NVR are titled differntly than whats on the Q-See cameras.

The software on this is terrible.  The iOS viewers do not \"fully\" support the QC804 and are buggy / crash all the time.  This is the type of system you end up with when you tell a team of a hundred talented engineers to \"design\" a product: i.e. a myriad switches and options that don't work quite together and extremely poor documentation.I'm not saying there are users who this will work perfectly for, i.e. if your UPNP setup worked flawlessly and iOS viewer worked, then that's great.  I can only speak to my own experience.I also tried using the QSee free dynamic dns service but then gave up after it wouldn't update after a day.  Instead signed up for a $20 dyndns service that worked flawless and expected.Update:  I'm revising my review as the problems I had may be more reflective of my router than the DVR.

Well, these devices are like that except several times more complex and any nephews that are around these days have never seen a VCR.However, the directions are *relatively* easy to follow, if a bit cumbersome.  (They are provided in as a wall-sized poster with very large print.  This is in stark contrast to the matchbook sized \"manuals\" with microscopic print that seem too popular these days.  Here's hoping someone will find a middle ground.The extra mile provided by this manufacturer is a US-based support staff that is there to answer calls and provide real answers when they do... answer.  After I got the DVR configured using the provided instructions I called with a few questions that I thought would be typical.  The responses were easy to understand and, better still, correct.As a downside for some, the interface, either directly with the DVR or over the web is a bit clunky.  Then again, someone needing a \"fancy\" setup would probably opt for BlueIris and their own cameras.  This is more for someone that does not want or need lots of bells and whistles and would prefer instead to have a solid multichannel recorder that once configured won't need a lot of care and feeding.", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "WOW!!! What a nice product!", "Author": "Jerry Helsing \"jlhelsing\"", "ReviewID": "R23KDQCIWDA8WT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, I am with the other reviewers here in that this thing is difficult to set up.  With a phone call to Q-see though, it was smooth sailing.First, it is very different than the previous systems I used since this requires digital high definition cameras, not the standard CCTV cameras.  It is amazing to compare the 2 side by side and see the clarity difference between the 2.  With the old system, you can make out a car and person getting out of the vehicle, but making out a plate number was impossible.  With this system, I am able to do that and then some.  I know that most of that is a function of the cameras, but without the NVR to record it, I wouldn't have anything.Second, the 1TB Hard Drive is nice because it is storing more information than the standard 600 lines of resolution and needs the space.Third, being able to access this from anywhere was pretty simple to setup and allows me to know whats going on while I am away.There is so much more about this system that I need to learn inorder to do this review justice.  All I can say is I am looking forward to playing with it and I am happy it is working as well as it is.
