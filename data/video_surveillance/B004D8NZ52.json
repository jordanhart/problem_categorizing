My place has been hit a couple of times, quick grab and go scoundrels and not much more. I purchased 6 of these to place around our property and I used lithium batteries, not the cheaper types that you might install in a flashlight.The lithium batteries power a small red LED light that blinks on and off and give the impression the cameras are \"on\" and \"seeing\" what might be in their view. The LEDs have been blinking reliably for a month straight and at night they look VERY real.I'm impressed with this device because they resemble true cameras that emit an invisible infrared light for night viewing. They have held up well in storms and are easy to adjust and rotate. If someone looks close at the front of the camera, it appears to have built in infrared illuminators. These are the new technology \"lights\" that provide an invisible light that the eye can not see, but a professional crook might understand and know is the same style of light used on expensive \"game cameras\" that hunters use to capture images of animals at night.I'm happy with my purchase and I feel these \"fake\" cameras do a good job to discourage thieves.(UPDATE... NOVEMBER 2013.  These \"cameras\" are still working well and in the 2 years since I wrote this review, I have not had any crooks steal anything from me.Some points...* Lithium batteries. Sometimes they will run the camera for 3 weeks and sometimes they run 5 weeks. I surmise this might have something to do with cold or hot season.* Some discussions here stating \"no wires\" and my thoughts are \"no big deal\" because WiFi cameras look a lot like this and, cameras placed around by deer hunters have no wires, because the have SD cards that can record video.Bottom line... in two years, I have not had a failure in anyone of the 6 \"cameras\" I bought, and the little red blinking LED light is easy to see at night. They have been sitting outside, unprotected and have been rained on, snowed on, have stayed out in the Texas sun (it was 111 degrees here one summer) and they haven't missed a beat.", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good buy", "Author": "Ken", "ReviewID": "R13MK2VC9NABC5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Looks good.

I made a noise, they saw me, and they ran away. I imediately wanted something to deter this from happening again so I got this fake vid cam as a temporary measure until I get something that takes real photos. So far no noises, but its too early to tell.From my point of view, this fake camera looks real from afar, especially if you install it somewhere elevated and out of reach. I highly recommend the latter because, up close, it looks and feels plasticy. At night, a trespasser might not tell the difference. But since its low quality and empty inside, it can be easily destroyed and knocked down (by the trespasser). ANother tip, it comes with a realistic power wire stemming from behind the camera down to the mounting bracket., but obviously, you have to install it in a place where its believable. Dont be installing it on a palm tree or concrete wall expecting burglars to think there's power running to the camera.The battery compartment was a real pain to take off, I felt like I was ripping the thing apart. But once installed the red LED light blinked continuously for 1 second every second. So it WILL be noticed. Now people will know you have \"eyes at night\". WIll they think its fake? WIll they think you are protecting something important? Only time will tell, because this camera won't.UPDATE 10/26/12 *******Its been a year now since I originally wrote this review, and so far I haven't come across an incident where I was startled by suspicious activity from the outside (knock on wood).

B.", "ReviewID": "R2N64YKGL708NO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The most important question anyone should be asking themselves regarding a dummy camera is; does it look real. Will it fool people into thinking it's an actual functioning camera. If the answer is yes, then you have found what you're looking for and you should consider buying it. But what if the answer isn't quite \"yes.\" What if it only comes close?I liked the way this camera looked over the others that were offered and I bought it. When it arrived, my initial thought was; I guess it looks as real as a plastic camera can. Sometimes it's hard to tell from an item's picture of what you're going to get until you actually hold it in your hand. Don't get me wrong, the photo they have posted is actually what you will receive. There is no deception; just understand it's all plastic. Maybe real security camera's and their accociated mounting brackets are actually made of plastic these days, I don't know. I guess I was hoping for some thin aluminum somewhere to help with the deception. I agree with the other reviewers in one sense; it does look real ... but I have to add, 'if it's not viewed too closely or when it's dark.' If you have somewhere high you can mount it, I think you will be pleased. Keep in mind not to mount it too high because you will eventually have to replace the batteries (2 AA, not included.) Also, don't mount it directly under an unmovable object for the same reason. The battery compartment is on top of the camera and you don't want to take the entire camera down just to swap out the batteries.This camera comes close and I am currently using it. It has fooled some of my neighbors already and that's a good sign it's doing what it was intended to do.

There are some other giveaways that fake cameras need to address if they are going to appear to have infrared night vision.

Like most people I'm willing to pay 9 bucks for the chance it will fool a crook. I think it at least gives me an advantage over the person with no camera- real or fake. Some folks don't like the flashing light, but a fake camera is worthless if it doesn't get seen and the light gets it seen. There are also complaints that it is not well-made. It isn't, but it looks like it is. It seems fairly intuitive, but before you attempt to adjust the camera angle you need to loosen the rounded knob on the bottom of the pivot joint. I suspect a lot of people broke the arm trying to adjust without loosening this joint.UPDATE: Battery life is a little disappointing. I installed four \"cameras\" on 6/19/13 and all four went dead on 9/8/13. I now agree with the reviewers who recommend leaving the batteries out. The flashing light is pretty unsubtle and can be seen from hundreds of feet away. Not really necessary.

It has been a long time since camera's like this have utilized any type of flashing light.

After reading and talking to Security Installers and looking at my 3 real cameras, something I learned, the thieves have these figured out already, but you can fix that.First off real cameras do not have a blinking red light on front. To thieves this is a dead giveaway. Leave the battery out. Real Camera's have a green light on the back, and it does not blink and is only for the purpose of showing that the camera's are activated. But, as soon as a knowledgable thief sees a blinking red light on a security camera, that tells them this is fake. And to note, I am not giving away anything here, that information is available on many of the Security sites.Secondly, real camera's can be wireless but if they are they do not necessarily have a visible antennae. None of mine do. But they all have some power source, not batteries. They will not have the single thick wire that you see on these (At least the camera's I received). They will have two thin wires going into a hole behind the camera.Blinking red light and single thick wire is a dead giveaway to the thieves.Drop the battery and drill two tiny holes behind the camera. Get yourself some red and black thin wire and attach it to the back of the camera (I used a small piece of electrical tape) and stick the other ends of the wires in the holes.Thieves wont know the difference between real and fake.Otherwise they look absolutely real and were pretty soldily built, even compared to my real cameras.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Looks real", "Author": "Rachel Hester", "ReviewID": "R9NPNGMGW1AQT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't want to embarrass anyone I know by naming names, but several people who saw these thought that they were real.

From a distance, this looks like a real security camera.  Anything closer than 3 feet and you will know this is a toy.  I even had a neighbor come over and immediately ask why I had mounted a fake camera.  In his words, \"from a distance it looks real and the wire and LED are convincing, but as you get closer, it really looks bad.\"Be aware of discrepancies in the product description.  As shown, the camera looks like it has three mounting holes.  The actual unit has only two.  Not a big deal, but a discrepancy nonetheless.  Under \"Technical Details,\" the product description states \"a Yellow security sticker is included.\"  Mine did not come with any stickers or documentation; just the cam and some mounting screws stuffed in a box.  Installation is self-explanatory but I would have liked the stickers.  The details also say \"The camera requires 2 AA batteries that are not included.\"  In reality, the camera takes 2 AAA batteries which are not included.Arm movement and positioning is very limited.  I had to mount the camera much higher than I anticipated because the head does not tilt the way I thought it would.  I personally think the fake dome cameras are more convincing.

The fake cord that inserts into the base is a nice touch.  I actually have real security cameras installed around the house, but wanted this to cover a back door that is not picked up by the real cameras.  There are a few differences between this one and my real cameras.First the blinking light.  The real IR cameras don't have the light.  I suppose this is to attract attention to the light, which if you are using a fake is probably the point.  Either way, if you don't want to use the light, simply don't put any batteries in it.I think the biggest giveaway that this is a fake is the fact that it is about 3x the size of a standard camera and 2x the size of my 170 degree wide angle camera.  Modern cameras are now pretty small and this, while not overly large, is certainly oversized.

There are even customer sumitted photos that show what he got was clearly not what is being advertised. I don't know what determines which one you get....but I personally got the camera that is being advertised. So my review is based on the camera that is advertised.**********I can't say how much I am impressed with the look of this camera. Most of the reviews have given it a positive rating on how realistic it looks. I always keep my expectations and standards low though. Especailly with a fake camera.I purchased two in hopes of creating a more secured look to my home. Received them quickly with Prime and couldn't believe it when I opened them up!! These cameras look so real!! The lens. The infrared lights. The overall look.There have been a few reviews stating that the low grade plastic makes the camera look fake. I guess that must be a personal opinion.....I personally think it looks great up close, even better mounted on a wall.Installing them was a breeze. I installed both in just under an hour. The only reason it even took me that long was because I took time in deciding where exactly I wanted to put them. I put them up about 10-12ft high from the ground. I'm telling you...I would challenge you to tell me that you knew for a fact those cameras were fake. They look so good. The blinking red LED just sinches the deal. It let's people know there is some sort of power source to these things. It's not just an empty plastic casing. Even more reason to believe that they may be real! Even my nosey neighbor was impressed when she stopped by to talk to me about my impressive new camera system, never once questioning if they were real or not.Now...I've also seen multiple reviews for this, as well as several other, fake cameras concerning the flashing red LED light. Reviews ranging from everyday people to security camera installers that have practically done installations since the security camera was invented[sarcasm]. They all say that no real camera has that blinking light. That it's a dead give away that it's fake. Well...unfortunately I don't have the luxury of a real system. During the day, sure ok, I guess people can see the cameras even without the LED. They look super real and all that.....but if I don't have the blinking LED going at night, there might as well be nothing there...because you can't SEE it. The camera is FAKE. It cannot record. It's NOT night vision capable. So I NEED it to be seen at night. I need a potential thief to be able to SEE, even in the dark, something possibly watching them. It does me no good to have a fake realistic camera at night that cannot be seen. It defeats it's whole purpose. To be a deterrent.Plus, if my home is being staked out by the Ocean's 13 crew, I doubt I'll stand a chance even WITH real cameras.You everyday lowlife and common robber are not going to risk breaking into a home or office with these cameras just becuase they MIGHT be fake because they have a blinking red LED. Why risk it? They'll just move onto the next house or business that doesn't have ANY cameras. Real or fake. I know I would.These cameras are not a fancy $500-$1000 complete CCTV home system....but I think they do the same thing: Deter. That's what we all really want. Right? We want to deter any illicit act. These cameras will give you just that....and only at just a little over $10 each. That is quite a bargain.Each camera also comes with a little 4x4 yellow sticker with a camera silhouette and \"CCTV\" printed on it. Great litte addition to the whole package.I also wanted to address the reviews talking about the flimsy the joint is, as well as the mounting bracket....all because of the cheap plastic used to make these. I have to agree.....it defnintely feels like if you put too much force, you'll break something. So guess what? I didn't man handle it. I was calm and gentle with it. I mean it's a $10 fake camera. You really expect it to be able to take someone moving it and yanking it around? Also, when I mounted the camera to the wall, I didn't screw in the screws so hard so as to keep the camera there for all time. The camera isn't heavy. It doesn't have to be practically fused to the wall to stay.So yes, it does feel flimsy somewhat. It may even break with a little excessive force....But if you are careful with it, it will survive the installation and look great up and running. I've purchased three and all have made it without breaking.I highly recommend this product to add onto your existing security system or even create your own \"security system\".*********UPDATE 08-10-12***********As of today, two of the three cameras' batteries have died completely. The third cameras seems to be going strong. I wrote my original review the day after installing them. So on July 13th, I installed two, brand new Energizer AA batteries in each camera. I'm not sure if it's the brand of battery(I'm more partial to Duracell, but only had Energizer on hand) or if it's the camera. I expected it to last at least a couple of months. Either way, that's my only complaint thus far. I'll be trying out some Duracell batteries this time. See if that makes a difference.

Livingston \"DocZoom\"", "ReviewID": "R2ENEKGXRX3E06", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These realistic dummies are a great concept! If you think about it, the primary working principle for surveillance cameras is simply the intimidation factor. Actually capturing an image of a crime and the violators in action is not a solution. At that point, the damage is done and you'll likely not find the bad guys even with high quality images of them. They'll be long gone with your stuff forever.I bought two of the fakes here and one real working surveillance camera. Once they are all in place, I can keep watch and record a \"live zone\" while creating the illusion that there is somewhat greater comprehensive coverage. Even from just a few feet away, one can't distinguish between the dummies and the real camera. This \"hybrid\" system is very effective and saves a boat-load of cash. (Real security cameras, of any quality, are very expensive. An entire system is radically pricey.)Our neighbors all know that we have just installed surveillance cameras. Even on sunny days, the blinking red LED lights command attention. The blinking light is a nice touch. It's very bright and draws attention to itself... so much so that it will invite thieves to take a second glance. It looks very real but mount it high and out of reach because if a thief is able to touch it, then the illusion is gone. You see, it's made of plastic and is somewhat light weight. A slight nudge is all it takes to realize that it's hollow and weightless.Requires two AA batteries that install under the hood (on top) which is removed by sliding off. It's not exactly a water-tight design. A heavy, blowing rain will likely soak the battery compartment at some point (even though the hood covers it).Not, sure how long two AA batteries will last with an LED light flashing constantly. Hopefully, I won't have to drag a ladder out every few weeks to replace batteries.Bottom line... thieves know that dummy cameras exist. They know that bogus security signs and decals exist.

It's a great attempt at a decoy camera, but falls short.The blinking light is far too bright and located behind the \"camera lens\" right at 6:00 (bottom, center). With the camera pointed downward, the red light illuminates/reflects on the bottom half of the \"lens\". This alone is a complete giveaway since it would produce a red glow for several frames of the recording every other second. At night time, it would probably block out the picture entirely.The plastic...well, it's a good attempt at plastic trying to look like metal. It's not too obvious as long as the decoy is more than 15 feet away. Any closer than that and it looks suspiciously like a plastic toy. Also, the plastic visor on top is a bit flimsy...Even though it is secured in a couple of grooves on the side, it seems a strong wind gust could blow it off.Adjusting the camera can be a bit tricky - once you tighten it into place, it is hard to loosen and re-adjust. Others have reported breaking the camera unintentionally because of this according to many of the 1-star reviews.In the end, if you want a decoy, I recommend looking elsewhere. I would have given a higher rating if this camera was advertised as a plastic model and not as a \"Dummy Security Camera\" and I could not disagree more with this statement in the product description: \"even the most sophisticated criminals will think the premise is guarded by a high-tech surveillance system\".", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Everyone thinks it's the real thing.", "Author": "Terry okerstrom", "ReviewID": "R13ZWNAQXT2JFM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this with a motion sensor for less than $20 for both.

The fake cameras are identical to the real except for the inner mechanisms. They screw in and you can run electrical wiring from each DUMMY CAMERA into the house. Also, adjust your LED SPOT LIGHTS where you will think they are most effective. The Dome blinks RED and the DUMMY SECURITY CAMERA blinks silver. If you are up to no good, chances are is that you are scared of getting caught. They look real. I would just stay away from my house. I don't think they have the mind set to examine if they are real or not. They are blinking as if they are taking pictures and my LED SPOTS turn on. My price for all: $29.20 with free shipping. I am very happy and the quality of these DUMMYS are excellent. They look just like my neighbor's cameras and he spent $1200.00. If you examine the price difference, my choice is better than the real.

But here is a list of the things I DON'T like about the product:> The camera does NOT come off the pivot mount, which can make it very difficult to access the screws to mount the flat plate to the wall or other surface.> You should plan on throwing away the screws provided. They are made of VERY soft metal, and the philips slots will strip out very quickly if you get just a bit off of straight in. Unfortunately, because of the PRIOR bullet, it's nearly impossible to drive the screws in straight because the camera doesn't come off the mount.> The flat plate that mounts to the wall is thin and cheap - if you over-tighten the screws even just a little bit you will crack the plate.> The whole thing is very cheap plastic. I doubt that these will last more than one or two seasons of heat (I live in the Phoenix metro area). I imagine the same problem might occur with very cold winters such as in the midwest. You could argue that for $9 it's OK to replace them every year or so; I would counter that although the expense is low, these are generally mounted very high and are not easy to access for removal, replacement or servicing.> The rubber tube which is the faux \"wiring\" for the faux camera looks good, but again, I doubt that it will stand up to more a one or two years of extreme heat or cold.BTW, based on reviews that suggested the batteries last only a few months, and my lack of desire to climb a high ladder every other month to change batteries, I did NOT install batteries, so mine don't have the blinking red light. Some other reviewers have suggested that REAL security cameras don't have blinking lights, so they may be right that having the light blink simply advertises the fact that these are not real. I just don't know.Summary: They appear to meet the bill in the short term, but I doubt that they will last.Here's what I'll likely do when these fail: I'll find some unrepairable REAL cameras and install them.

My bad, it was my fault. Super glue did the trick. What I did however, was modify it a little. I used to install for a real security company and I found the black looking wire in the back of this camera is kind of cheesy. What can you expect for the money. I am buying a couple more camera's by the way. Anyway, I just got a piece of red phone wire, white thin, (2 conductor wire, and because the piece that came with it was black, I got a piece of regular black thin cable wire. OK, I over did it a little but read on... I have had a lot of home break in's in the area and needed to make this as real looking as I can. So I took off the back cover, drilled 2 holes with a 1/4\" drill bit so I could fit 3 wires in the camera, one whole at a time. You can glue it in if you want but it is not really needed. The point is, you have 3 wires, different colors, coming out of the camera now. Depending on how long you need those wires to go, like up in your attic, will determine how long the wire should be cut. ( Two wires will be fine, I just have access to red wire and that is why I added that to). Just make them a different color to show that one is for CCTV, and one is for the Security System. I mounted my camera near the eve of the roof on my back porch, looking at the back door. I drilled a whole, just big enough to fit the wire through the outside roof and simply stuck them in. I tie wrapped the wires to make them look like a company installed it and used sillicone to fill the hole. That was almost 3 months ago and my camera still flashes red, with only 2 AA batteries. My neighbor has already called the cops on some kids running out of my back yard. They got caught, were charged with trespassing but were minors and they were let go. The point is it worked, they saw the camera and took off. I hope you guys get the same as I got out of these.

I ordered one to put inside my place after finding out I was getting uninvited visits from the landlord when I wasn't home. I can tell you that from a distance it looks like the real thing. I can't say I approve of the blinking red light (real cameras don't have this), but it does a good job of getting someone to notice the camera if it's tucked into a dark corner that would otherwise be missed... If you don't like the light, just leave the batteries out, problem solved.After installing the first one, I decided to order a second one to point toward the back door (from inside). I think these would look good outside as well, but I'm on the fence about drawing that much attention to my place from the outside- as if to say \"I've got something really good in here, and I need cameras to protect it.\" I wouldn't mind sending that message if they were real, but prying eyes would be able to tell these were fake if you got a close enough look at them. I figure if they are mounted inside and someone breaks in and then sees them, they aren't going to stand around long enough to inspect them to find out if they are real. If they are mounted outside, someone could get close to them to inspect them without drawing much attention..Anyway, I digress... As stated before, for the price you can't beat these for cheap added security - I would just think twice before mounting outside vs inside. 4 stars instead of 5 only because the mounting bracket is cheap plastic, but that's being really picky for the price point..", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "looks real", "Author": "daryl moses", "ReviewID": "R38MKS7Y62R6RH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this fake camera is very realistic.

I also purchased a wireless Driveway Alert System, a 100ft CATV cable (power and video) and a small 12volt power supply to go with the camera.

However, any curious visitor who is tall enough can easily yank on the cable to see if the camera is real or fake.

Adams", "ReviewID": "R2BYK49L9NXYOM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this fake camera (several actually) for different reasons than most and I wanted to share my story: We treated our next door neighbors like kings & queens for years since they seemed to be somewhat down on their luck. We gave them money, clothes, food from our cupboards, games & toys for their children and even rides to and back from football practice for one of their kids. We became so close that at one point our neighbors were calling my Fianc\u00e9' \"Aunt\" if that tells you anything. Well after several years of giving and giving we started to notice that we got nothing in return. Not that we were expecting anything but after 3 years you start to feel used.This neighbor next door (known as Heather E.) took advantage of us as well as several other neighbors and simply used us and took all she could get. There are too many details to share but you should know that Heather has a new best friend every 4 months and is often fighting with someone for various reason (mostly in her head).Shortly after we weaned ourselves of this one-sided relationship we saw that Heather E. and family began just opening their back door (that faced our house) and instead of putting their trash in the garbage can, they simply tossed it outside and let it land where it may. After a year+ of dealing with this \"trash house\" we were forced to contact the City of Gresham Code Enforcement here in Oregon. Code Enforcement quickly hopped on it and delivered an ultimatum to Heather E. and family: Clean things up or be fined. That night we saw Heather E., her best friend of the moment and one of her sons quickly cleanining up the refuse at 8:30pm at night!What we didn't know was that for the past year Heather E. and family were throwing bags of trash into their shed outdoors and it had accumulated so much that it was overflowing inside! 2 days after Heather E. was forced to clean things up, I went outside and noticed that there was a large, dead possum laying on the path to my shed. This possum had clearly been dead for months and the only way that it made its way to my path was that is was placed there by someone. My Fianc\u00e9 and I quickly surmised that this possum had gotten into Heather E.'s shed and became trapped inside where it died. As retribution for contacting Code Enforcement, our wonderful neighbors placed the possum on our property. I quickly picked up the possum and threw it back into Heather E.'s shed (with a glove mind you) and never heard about it again.This is where the fake camera comes in: Rather than buy a gun or 2, along with a 6-foot fence with barbed wire or take some kind of militant stand here, I decided on a different approach. I had no idea what Heather E. and family might do next to escalate things so a fake camera was the PERFECT solution. Once installed, Heather E. instantly went on Facebook complaining about my cameras and even posted that they were \"illegal\" and \"he doesn't have permission to film my house!\" Clearly Heather E. doesn't know the law. :)In a nutshell these cameras worked like a miracle. They fooled our neighbors into thinking that they were being filmed at all times and basically it kept them from damaging our property (or worse). An unexpected bonus is that Heather E. and family never come out on that side of the house. Since they think they are on camera 24 hours a day, they choose to smoke on the other side of their house and rarely make an appearance. Even better, Heather E. is so paranoid that she put up cheap towels over the windows and doors so my cameras couldn't see in. LOL! Wonderful. Quick lesson:  The paranoid don't like having cameras pointed at them.These cameras look real (at least to the low-life people next door) and it keeps them honest and away from our house. Sure, no one likes fighting with neighbors and we really have 0 contact with them which is great, but these cameras add an extra layer of protection. If Heather E. wants to mess with our house or vandalize things, she thinks she'll be on camera. This couldn't have worked better for a non-violent, passive solution to our neighbors from hell.We have our neighbors trained and life is good again.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "good idea", "Author": "Rod Dietrich \"Rod\"", "ReviewID": "R17BYTAJ6KOZB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased, and less then a month later, we had a armed robbery of our house, and these didn't even slow them down, and us or the sheriff can't figure out why", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fake camera", "Author": "Scott Collett", "ReviewID": "R3V4U98H5MY1KN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Light blinks unlike a real camera.

Theives will recognize someone who doesn't know much about real cameras when they see a blinking light.  The lens cover has a foggy mirror-type glaze over it, making it look very realistic.  Also, it is plastic but appears to be robust metal.  Also, the black \"cable\" is very believable if you \"wire\" it the right way into a corner, under an eave, or from the ceiling.  The camera didn't come with the yellow warning sticker.  Overall, this is one of the best and most realistic decoys out there!  I highly recommend it.

In my county the police department hands out the fine. Don't know if it works that way everywhere.
