{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Does what it Says", "Author": "J. Pierce \"Disrputive Thinker\"", "ReviewID": "R29S8YPGNPE31Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to use as a cheep wireless IP webcam.  It offers the ability to hook into your network either with the wireless WSP functionality or with an ethernet connection.  It is fairly small with the camera being about the size of an iphone (maybe about 80% that size). The base allows for you to mount it in multiple settings, but be clear, this is a very simple design...not rocket science by any means.  The ac power cord is about 4 feet long.Setup: I ran into an issue when I was trying to set up the wireless connection.  I could not get my camera and wireless router to talk at all.  I called tech support (the free version) and they were useless.  The rep had no clue about the specific devise and it is clear that he was just in a large call center that probably supports dozens if not hundreds of products.  I had NO problem when I hooked it into my network via an ethernet cable.  The set up application runs very nicely and easily gives you the option to select either wireless or wired set up as needed.Back to my wireless problem.  I decided that I would pay $32 for D-Links premium support for 30 minutes of help...I rolled the dice, as they do not guarantee they will fix your problem for your investment, but I had a feeling my issue was something simple with my network configuration...and I was right.  The rep was great, she remoted into my pc, checked out my wireless settings on my router and determined that I had a bad character in my site name.  None of my other wireless products had a problem with the character, but the D-Link cam did not like it.  She changed the name of my wireless network, we restarted the router,and instantly the camera linked in wirelessly.I am absolutely convinced that if I had not had a dash in my wireless network name, then this wireless set up would have been a breeze.  So, I can't place blame for this issue on D-Link, but it was interesting that no other wireless device I use had a problem with the naming convention of the network.Once that hurdle was cleared, it has been smooth sailing.  I really like the ease of use and the functionality included with the set up...through a web interface, you can control video size, audio (yes it has a mic and sends the audio over IP in realtime), you can set motion detection, auto emailing on detection, and it even has a built in ftp server to send the images where ever you like.Simple camera that does exactly what it says...it provides decent video and audio wirelessly to your network and then you can do with it what you want.Pros: Simple, straight forward, nice setup application used on your pc, D-Link offers free remote viewing via their web portal MyD-link, and they also offer a free iPhone app (no audio on the iPhone app).Cons: Seems somewhat fragile...I would not want to drop it form more than a foot off the ground.  A fall from any higher seems would shatter it.Overall I think this is a really good value.((Update Dec. 18, 2011)So I have had this camera in service for over a year now...and it has been installed outside, under an eave of my house.  It has no additional protection from the elements...just its own casing and the few inches of cover provided by the eave.  It has been subjected to all the weather Atlanta receives in a year...heat 95+, cold 9, wind, rain, humidity, etc. The verdict...GREAT..not one issue with it.  So, I just purchased three more for outdoor viewing around the house.  I put one into service yesterday and had NO problems with setup at all.  Used the auto network connect feature on the camera and my Netgear router and it hooked in within a minute.  Great little camera and with the price dropped to $70, I think it will be hard to beat it.", "Date": "December 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Home security made simple", "Author": "Ammy_Evaluator", "ReviewID": "R3PIEMA7W74CPI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a review for the DLink DCS-930L Day camera.Updated 8/18/2013: Edited to add detailed setup instructions.Original Review:##########This is the easiest way I found to monitor our home remotely.I was pleasantly surprised with how quickly everything came together - I had the camera installed and transmitting in less than 15 minutes. I plugged the camera into a power outlet, popped the CD in (on a Windows 7 64-bit computer), entered my wireless network credentials, set up a DLink account from which to monitor the camera, and presto!What works well:###########1. The lens is reasonably wide angle - it can cover most of a normal size room.2. It has audio! And it works very well.3. Image quality is decent - you can recognize people, but it isn't broadcast quality by any means.4. Moving the camera kills the feed for a couple of minutes, but it's back on the network in less than 2 minutes.5. The iPhone app is cool! We were able to watch the camera just as well on an iPod Touch. As another reviewer suggested, Tiny Cam (the free version is sufficient) worked great for me on Android.6. The admin interface for the camera is stellar. You can control the refresh rate and resolution of the camera; the saturation, brightness, and contrast of the image; and the volume for the audio. You can even turn off the annoying LED light on the front of the unit!7. Setting up motion detection is also really easy. You just pick the sensitivity of detection, and click on parts of the frame where you want detection to trigger. That's it! When motion is detected, you can ask the camera to email you the images.8. Setting up email notification is simple too. I looked up the SMTP address and port for Yahoo, entered my email address and password, and was soon receiving emails from my camera!9. It connects via Wireless-N and has an awesome range. It connects without problems to my router from across the house, through multiple walls.10. This device supports WPS. What this means that you can automatically configure it to access your router, with just a couple of button presses. (However, due to security issues with WPS, I recommend that you turn off WPS on your router.)What doesn't:##########1. The camera does not work in low light conditions as it does not have infrared capabilities. You need at least a 40W lamp for it to be functional. This tends to be a bit annoying for me, as the camera becomes fairly useless once evening falls. The infrared-capable DCS-932L may be a better choice in this regard.2. No pan/tilt options on this camera. For me, this is not as big a deal as the low light issue, especially given its wide angle of view.3. The camera feels a bit delicate, but should hold up well given that it isn't going to be handled much. It did take a couple of falls and has survived. (Updated 8.18.13: My camera's stand has since broken. Thank goodness for duct tape.)4. The camera needs to be plugged into an electrical outlet. Its short power cord does limit the locations where it can be placed.Conclusions:########Overall, this was plug and play installation at its best.I also can't believe there is a simpler way to get all of this functionality in a single unit. This device is extensively customizable. I was particularly impressed that the designers had thought about putting in a way to turn off the blinking LED in the front of the camera. This LED is a very useful diagnostic tool (it flashes amber when it is setting itself up, and green when it is broadcasting), but it drove me nuts, until I found this option in the admin panel.Hope this helps.Happy Monitoring!Continue reading if you want to setup your camera manually. While this is more involved, it also means you need not install any additional software. However, you do lose the ability to record video.Updated Aug 18, 2013: Manual Setup################################Before you begin, remember that you only have one publicly visible IP address - and this is allocated by your ISP, and is assigned to your router. Inside your network, your devices are allocated private IP addresses, in the range 192.168.x.y. These addresses are termed \"private\" because they only make sense within your own internal private network.A computer outside your network only recognizes the public IP address of your router. It has no idea how many devices you might have on your internal network.So how do you access your camera from outside your home network?The answer is to use port forwarding to uniquely identify one of your internal devices, and make it addressable over the Internet. You do this by reserving a particular port (say, 90), and telling your router that any attempt to access that particular port on the router's public IP address, should actually be sent directly to the internal device (this camera) identified by a given private address (say, 192.168.1.5).You will need to add a new port forwarding rule to your router for each camera that you need to expose externally.Setup the camera############1. Connect the camera to your router with an Ethernet cable2. Login to your router, and note the camera's internal IP address (Attached Devices page)3. Navigate to that IP address in a browser to access the camera's web server4. Login to the camera as \"admin\" with a blank password (default)5. Verify that you can watch the camera's video6. In the camera's interface:....Setup tab > Wireless Setup menu > Wireless Settings section: check Enable; set SSID; Security Mode and your network key....Maintenance tab > Admin menu > Admin Password Setting: set a new password (important!)....Maintenance tab > Admin menu > Server Setting section: LED Control=Off7. Disconnect the Ethernet cable. You should now connect wirelessly.Setup the router#############1. Add a DHCP Address Reservation for the camera's internal IP address.That way each time your camera connects to your router, it will always get the same IP address.2. Add a Port Forwarding Rule:Use Service type=TCP/UDP. External start/end port=90. Internal start/end port=80. Internal IP address=your camera's reserved address.To verify your port forwarding rule works, use the external IP address (shown on your router's status page) and forwarded port, e.g., of the form http : // a.b.c.d:90 (remove spaces). When a request comes in to your router at port 90, it will now forward it directly on to port 80 at your camera's IP address.That's it!Advanced Manual Setup:################Here are a few advanced options for using this camera.Dynamic DNS:##########If your IP address changes frequently, or are tired of remembering numeric addresses, register at a dynamic DNS provider, such as dyndns.org. My router, a WNDR4500, actually keeps dyndns informed whenever my public IP address changes. I can now use a text-based domain name and it will be automatically converted of my IP address.Setup Email##########Your camera can automatically send you emails. To do that, it needs to know information about your email provider as well as your username/password credentials. The steps below are for gmail, but you can look up the equivalents for other email providers.(also see Abhilash's notes in the comments below)Setup tab > Mail menu....SMTP Server Address: smtp.gmail.com....SMTP Server port: 465....Sender email address: your sending email address at gmail....Receiver email address: the email that should receive sent emails....User name: the part of your sending email address before the @gmail.com....Password: your email password....Use SSL-TLSClick the Test Email Account.Verify the status of the test, at Status > Device Info > E-mail Test.Motion detection:#############You can have the camera email you either on a schedule or if motion is detected in a configurable hot zone.Setup > Motion Detection....Motion Detection: Enable....Detection Area: click the squares of interestSetup > Mail....select \"Enable emailing images to email\"....select \"Motion Detection\"Finally, we're done :)Good luck!", "Date": "February 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great baby monitor!

The installation process was flawless. Unfortunately I can't use the camera as a baby monitor since the audio static is awful. The static is so loud you can't hear anything. Hopefully Dlink will address my concern. I'll update my review once I hear back from them. See my video if you'd like to hear the bad static. Also Dlink hasn't fixed the audio problem with the Iphone App. You only get video with the Iphone. I have the Iphone 4 with iOS 4.3 installed.4/5/2011: I contacted Dlink support. They said they know about the audio problem and they don't plan to fix it. Ughh! I'm going to return this one and see if a new one sounds better. I'll post more once I get the new one.4/14/2011: I received my new DCS-932L from Amazon today. The audio is just as bad with this camera. What a shame. I even upgraded my java version to 1.6.0_24-b07. Ughh. Time to send it back or pray for a firmware fix.8/31/2011: We've started to use this camera all the time since our baby is older and Iphone support has been added. The audio is good enough where we can hear him. I just wish Dlink would get rid of the static.3/5/2012: This camera has become our primary baby monitor for our 14th month old. The iphone apps work very well. Our Philips Iphone dock works great with the Dlink Iphone app. It amplifies the audio and cleans up the audio a bit. I'm adding 1 more star back. I still wish the the audio didn't have so much static, but this camera has turned out to be a great baby monitor.", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "D-Link DCS-932L or Linksys WVC80N - which is best for you ?", "Author": "swb_mct", "ReviewID": "R37VW6EWT6JJZH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was looking for a low cost wireless camera with better image quality than the Linksys WVC80N cameras that I have been using for a while.  Side-by-Side, this is how the cameras compared.Bottom Line:  Unless you need Night Vision or need the mobil phone apps, the Linksys WVC80N performs better at a lower price. Linksys has better image quality than D-Link at any distance, handles outdoor scenes when the D-Link won't and will deliver video clips (not just snapshots) by email or ftp.  The Linksys does not have phone-apps, but it can email a 5 second motion triggered video clip that can be viewed on your android phone.Best Useage:  The D-Link would be great as a baby cam or pet cam. The cute design, better audio and the night vision outperform the Linksys for these uses.The Linksys WVC80N would be better for any other use where the video quality under all lighting conditions (except dark) is the highest priority.Compare Image Quality @ 640x4801. Color Quality - D-Link is a little better than Linksys, unless it is an outdoor view.  The D-Link exposure control cannot manage any sunlit surfaces.  Even grass and trees are completely washed out to white if they are in direct sun. There are no settings to fix this.  In moderate light, the D-Link color is better than Linksys because the Linksys has a color hue gradient of red in the center to green at the perimeter. This color balance problem is distracting when viewing a white scene like snow or other very light backgrounds.2. Image Clarity - With the two cameras side-by-side with the same scene of near-and-distant objects, the D-Link by comparison looks optically out-of-focus, though neither camera is great in this respect. If you want to recognize a face at a distance Linksys is better.  The D-Link video clarity is fine for a baby's bedroom, because a near-field view does not demand the same sharp focus as a distant view.3. Sound Quality - The D-Link has good audio performance on an wireless \"N\" lan when accesses directly within your home using the camera's local IP address. Very little \"noise\", no skipping or break-up and good microphone pickup.  I didn't check it out across the internet or with the \"MyDlink\" connection, but I am guessing audio would not perform so well there . . as other reviewers have noted.The Linksys has more audio artifacts and is more vulnerable to the audio breaking up when the video settings are too demanding even on the local network.  Across the internet with high speed cable service at both ends, the Video has to be set at \"Low Quality\" and 2 or 1 frames per second for the audio to work without breaking up.Some Feature Comparisons1. The one obvious advantage with the D-Link is the night vision.  It works pretty well up to 20 feet but the pictures are very soft-focus. For your night-time application you may want to consider that the 4 red LEDS are very bright and draw your eye to the camera.2. The D-Link camera cannot stream video to a PC without using the full web management interface or using the MyDLink web service.  With the Lynksys you can play the video stream directly on an iPad or on a PC using Google's Chrome browser without the surroundings of a web interface. Internet Explorer will only show 1 frame of a video stream if you bypass the full management interface explaining why Google Chrome is mentioned. With the Linksys camera, Right-Click on the video in the normal interface to get the URL for the direct video stream to used on your iPad or Chrome.The D-Link can display a single .jpeg snapshot without the managment interface. This feature can be enabled in the camera's web interface and it tells the address format to use. This is for direct access, not using MyDink.2.  The D-Link cannot upload a video clip to an ftp server when it sees motion.  It will only upload a single .jpeg snapshot.  This will often give you a useless premature snapshot of a shadow but not the person, or a door opening but not the person. With the Linksys .mjpeg video clip, no video compression is used so each frame is a good .jpeg snapshot. You can select the best frame from the 5 second video that would give you the best view of the motion event that triggered the clip.3. The D-Link will only email 6 frames when it sees motion.  You can choose 1 or 2 frames per second. It will include the 3 frames it had buffered before it saw motion which is a good feature. This makes the email feature much more usefull than the D-Link ftp upload of a single .jpeg snapshot.For motion detection features, you may prefer the Linksys which will email, ftp (or both) a 5 second video clip at a normal video frame rate.I had no reason to examine the motion detect performance on the D-Link camera, but the motion detection on this Linksys camera works much better that on the prior similar models. With careful detection-area and sensitivity tuning, motion detection works great.  Motion Detection responds to shadows which makes outdoor use tricky but manageable.  Shadows on the ground caused by wind blowing the trees will trigger the camera so your detction areas need to be carefully targeted at areas of interest.Setup / Wireless CompatibilityWorking in a related tech business, I believe the negative reviews on either of these products regarding wireless compatibility or networking issues are the result of bad programming on the manufacturer's setup CD or the buyer's lack of network troubleshooting experience. If you have a friend who is very tech-savy to help you get past wireless and networking complications, either of these products will work reliably on virtually any wireless network. Sometimes the installation CD's will simplify networking issues and sometime they won't.Reading the complaints on Amazon about the D-Link setup, I had the same problems but they were caused by poor programming on Setup CD; not the camera.  If you get failure messages going through the Wizard on the CD, just use the web interface on the camera and save yourself a lot of grief. The web interface on the camera is excellent.Another reason to skip the DLink CD . . . it forces you to to create a MyDlink account with DLink even though you may have no need for the service because you prefer to port-forward to this camera.I returned this camera because it was a video quality downgrade from the Linksys cameras already in service.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "C.

I was pleasantly surprised with this DCS 942L.I placed this camera in my window pane pointing towards the front lawn. The picture is awesome, the motion sensor is awesome up to 50 feet (confirmed with my wife and a tape measure)I tested it inside the house and it is awesome. The picture quality is scary. This is a great baby or pet monitor.I wish D-Link made an affordable outdoor camera, I would purchase it too.Pros:1. Easy to set up. My wife and I set this one up in about 20 minutes.2. Truth is I did have to call customer service to get the password for the advanced settings on the mydlink site. FYI admin is your username and the password is the same password you use to set up your camera on the mydlink site.3. The mydlink site is intuitive. I have minimal to basic computer skills, and I was able to navigate it comfortably.4. Viewing your camera from anywhere there is an Internet connection is awesome.5. You can set the camera up to send you emails when the camera senses motion.6. The camera can take 10 pics and a 10 second avi each time it senses motion in an area you select.Con:1. The arm to adjust the camera is plastic and flimsy. You want it to lock it in but it is just to cheap.That is it for cons for me. For $150 bucks I was not expecting a HD camera.

I have now had both for about two months and am finding that my first camera's wireless connection has slowly gotten less and less reliable.  It had been in a fixed location the whole time with two walls and a floor between camera and wireless router (about 25 - 30 feet away).  Router settings have not changed.  I have performed extensive diagnostics, i.e. went through camera setup several times, changing router settings (removed all wireless security, used fixed IP) and nothing worked.  Reset button on camera did not help.  Firmware update did not help.I have finally found that the camera now only works within 15 feet or so of the router, and it must be on the same floor as the router with no walls in between.  This is unacceptable for a wireless camera, and my concern is that the wireless card within the camera is losing strength.  The other camera I own once worked outside of the house entirely and now will no longer work there nor in the location of the first camera (which is closer and less obstructed than being outside).  All other wireless devices we own have ample wireless signal throughout the house, our garage, and most of our yard, and as far as I can tell none of that has changed.As I am using an Airport Extreme router and thought that there might be some sort of compatibility issue I have even tried running the camera wireless through my old D-Link DIR-615 wireless router with a fully open wireless connection and have not had any luck...the signal range for the camera is the same.  DLink support has been no help, other than suggesting only using their routers (which didn't help) and rebooting everything and reconfiguring the camera (also did not help).I cannot recommend this camera to anyone due to this reliability issue.  It is fairly easy to set up and has a useful iPhone app available, but will likely be no use to anyone unless they can keep the camera within 15 feet of their access point with no obstructions in the long run.  All I can do is wait until I have the money to replace these cameras with something better.  Don't let this happen to you.  Start with a different camera first.", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good for plug-and-play usage, but difficult to customize use (see end of review for instructions)", "Author": "Edward Barnett", "ReviewID": "RWJ92SI9KZD4K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a decent camera that will work well if you want a simple plug-and-play webcam for monitoring purposes.  Setup is a challenge, though, if you decide to configure and run the camera manually, rather than using D-Link's software and portal.  (If you want to manage the video without using D-Link's portal, I've included instructions at the end of this review.)Positives:+ Good looking, fairly unobtrusive camera with a nicely designed ball-and-socket mount that can be set on a table or mounted permanently on a wall.+ Video quality is fine for room monitoring at the default configuration (320x240 pixels) and quality can be improved four-fold by resetting the video to VGA (640x480 pixels).  This isn't the same quality as an HD cam, so I wouldn't use this camera for Skyping, but it's fine for a room monitor.+ The DLink web service makes it simple to view the video feed from an internet connection when you're away from home, if you choose to use their portal.+ If your router supports WPS Setup, setting up the wireless connection is as easy as pressing a couple of buttons.Negatives:- If you don't want to use DLink's web portal for remote monitoring, setting up the camera manually requires a fair amount of technical knowledge.  I didn't like the idea of having DLink manage my video feed, so I went for the manual setup approach.  Unfortunately, there is no documentation for doing this, so you need to be comfortable configuring network devices.  Basically, DLink assumes you'll use their service if you want remote access.- If you don't need remote access (e.g., if you're using this as a baby monitor), things are a bit easier, but not trivial.  You'll need to manually hunt for the camera's IP address on your subnet, login, and manually configure the camera.  Once I figured out the IP and login name and password (which aren't in the setup guide), configuring the device for use at home was pretty straightforward.- If your router doesn't support WPS, getting the wireless connection established is a challenge.  You have to connect the camera to the router with a Cat5 patch cable, search manually for the IP, login (again, the manual doesn't give default login credentials), and manually set up the wireless connection.In a nutshell, this is a decent camera, and if you want to use DLink's software for configuring the camera and their portal for monitoring the video feed, it's a good, simple choice.  But DLink assumes you'll use their approach, and if you want to set up and use the device without using their software (which I didn't want to install on my laptop because it's a work computer) or portal (which I didn't want to use because I didn't like the idea of DLink managing my webcam feed) then you need to have technical knowledge and be willing to spend some time, without the benefit of instructions.UPDATE:  I finally managed to configure this camera manually and have it set up for monitoring from outside my network without using DLink's portal.  If you decide you want to do the same, here's how:- Connect the camera to your network with a Cat5 patch cable.  Using a browser on any PC on the network, search for the camera (you can use a utility to find connected devices, or just start entering IP addresses on your subnet until you get a hit).- Once you get a response from the camera, go to the setup tab then to wireless setup and enter the SSID and pre-shared key for your router so that you won't have to keep the camera connected with the Cat5 cable.- Then go to the network setup and enter a static IP address, enter your router's IP (the one on your subnet, not the external IP) into the default gateway field, and enter a port number other than 80 into the HTTP port field (80 is the default but many ISPs block port 80).- Next, log in to your router and set up port forwarding to forward activity on the port you set in the last step to the static IP address you entered in the last step.- To access the camera from outside your network, fire up a browser and enter your router's external IP address followed by a colon and the port number.  If you have a dynamic IP address from your ISP, you can use a service like DynDNS.org to get a common name keeps up with your ever-changing IP address.  You can also download a free/cheap livecam app on your iPad or iPhone that lets you monitor the video feed remotely.Important: You'll only need these instructions if you want to configure your DLink cam manually and want to monitor it directly without using DLink's portal.  The easier approach (by far) is to use the CD that comes with the camera, load and run DLink's setup software to configure the camera, and use their portal for monitoring.  But I didn't want to use their software or portal (I try not to load lots of potentially buggy software onto my computer, and I don't trust D-Link's security enough to have them managing my webcam feed), so I took the time to figure out the manual approach.  I hope these instructions are useful to anyone else who wants to do the same.", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great IP Cam if you have networking IQ", "Author": "Richard Malarky", "ReviewID": "R2VN59IUXZBXWB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm really digging this camera. If you have some basic networking chops then setup is a breeze and can easily be done on any operating system with a web browser without using the CD. Here's what you need to do.1) Plug the IP Cam directly into your router with an ethernet cord (there should be one provided in the box).2) Plug the power cord into your camera. =D3) From a web browser, log into your router and find the IP address of the camera. Finding the IP address is probably the hardest step. On my D-Link router the IP address can be found in the Setup -> Network Settings tab.4) From another browser window, enter the IP address of your camera. If you successfully entered the right IP address then you should see a login window. The default username is \"admin\" and the password should be left empty.5) Now you are at the setup page and you can add your wireless router and modify various settings.Here are a few extra steps that I highly recommend.- On your router, set up a DHCP Reservation to your IP camera or if your router doesn't have this feature then set up a static IP address on your camera.- Create a free dyndns.org account and set that up on your router, NOT directly on the camera.- Once you have dyndns setup on your router, set up a virtual server to forward a specific port to port 80 on your IP camera. (For instance yourname.dyndns.org:4444 will point to your ISP's DHCP IP address and then forward port 2000 directly to port 80 on your IP camera. This allows you to see your camera from any browser on any internet connected computer.)- If you have an android phone, install Tiny Cam from the Market and you should be able to see a live video feed on your mobile phone from anywhere you have wireless access.Setup was a very straightforward breeze for me. It took approximately 15 minutes to set everything the way I wanted it and I never touched the CD or instruction manual.For the price, the camera quality more than met my expectations.

Sun", "ReviewID": "R1HFJB24N9DGAI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased four DCS-930L cameras to set up a DIY home surveillance system. Overall I am happy with what they can do with such a low price tag.The installation was easy. After opening the box, I connected cameras to my router with network cables. And after I inserted the CD into my computer, the auto-run program led me through the entire process step by step. The program had no problem finding the cameras, and registered them to mydlink.com.That was the only time I needed that CD-ROM. Any additional setup, such as wireless, video, audio, motion detection, email, or ftp, etc, could be performed via mydlink.com. I could change the settings from anywhere with internet connection. And unlike other products, mydlink.com is free. This is indeed terrific!Setting up the wireless for DCS-930L was not difficult either. If you have the experience of adding a few window-based PCs into your home wireless network, you will find the process to add DCS-930L is exactly the same. I entered the SID and the WEP password, disconnected the network cable from the cameras, and unplug/plug the power cord. In about 1 minute the cameras (now wireless) showed up on mydlink.com!The wireless range on this camera is very good. I think D-link really listened to their users, since there were lots of complaints on the poor wireless range of its previous version DCS-920. I have a big house with many rooms. In a few remote rooms with many walls in between even my itouch cannot find wireless signal. But DCS-930L can! And the connection is always stable. So far I have never lost any video feed yet. Without wireless connection concerns, I can put the cameras anywhere there is a power outlet. (Yes, DCS-930 does need a power line. So it is not completely wireless. But I could always find outlets close enough to plug my cameras in.)A new feature you cannot find in DCS-920 is the motion detection. Again, via mydlink, I turned on motion detection, adjusted the detection sensitivity, and then selected the areas in the view point to be on/off motion detection. The sensitivity and the areas depend on what the cameras point to and the lighting condition of the time. So it took me a few days to experiment different settings in morning/evening sun-light, etc.After that, I went to the email setup page and select \"motion detection\" so that emails will be triggered by the motion detection. I intend to use it when I am away from my house. Again, DCS-930L has an enhancement over DCS-920: I can set up SSL emails so that my email password is always protected.The video quality is 640x480, which I believe is the same as the DCS-920. However, DCS-930 has an enhancement: Audio. I could hear the sound from the camera even when I clap my hand in a different room! Of course the quality of both video and audio is no where near HD. But given the low price tag, I have no complaints.The only major issue I can think of is the lack of the night vision. Without it the camera can hardly see anything during the night, and the entire surveillance system is therefore useless. (However, no camera in this price range has night vision, at least I could not find one.)Overall I am very happy with the camera.

One day there was a burglary and I started checking the recorded video. In one of the video I saw thief's feet moving top left corner in the video. Then when he is about to move to the center so I can see his face, then video abruptly ended. I was so mad, I can't even explain how mad I was! That's all this security camera recorded.

The security of mydlink is awful.  The vendor, Circuit City, is awful.I don't know what D-Link is thinking (probably not much).First, for context, I do software for a living and one might imagine I would know more about routers, WiFi, UPnP, port forwarding, and other relevant networking concepts than most consumers of this device should have to.Second, I'm not trying to do anything remotely fancy.  Just what it says on the box.Issues:The Wizard seemed unable to put the device on my WiFi network, and offered zero feedback about what the issue might be.  I have an absolutely vanilla network with WPA2 authentication.The Wizard appears to be the *only* way to create a \"mydlink\" account and associate a device with it.  (A \"mydlink\" account is required in order to access the iPhone and Android viewing features).  The \"mydlink\" site itself has almost no features or controls.  D-Link firmware has always been minimal, which is not all bad, but this site looks like it was written by junior high school students as a class project.The Wizard and the \"mydlink\" site appear to be badly broken with respect to password handling.  For example, I used a password generator to generate my passwords, and this generator, for security, creates passwords that include one or more punctuation characters (slash, plus, etc.) in the password; these characters choke up one or both of the Wizard and the mydlink site (the wizard and the site accept them without complaint, but just don't process them correctly).  I could systematically reproduce this problem.  Passwords are sent as HTTP parameters and URL-encoded; presumably they are not properly decoded by the \"mydlink\" server.  The Wizard was annoyingly telling me to \"check my connection to the Internet\", but, in reality, the HTTP response from \"mydlink\" was telling my computer that the data sent by the Wizard wasn't being processed properly.How do I know this was happening?  Well, I watched the packets over the network.  To my surprise (and mild shock), the system administration password for the camera is sent in human readable *plain* *text* over the Internet, to \"mydlink\" in an HTTP (not HTTPS) POST.  For those who don't know what this means, it means \"unbelievably bad security\".  Do you really want stealyourmoney.com watching your kid?  I don't.Next thing was to just use a bad password.  OK, \"cat\" anybody?  That password seemed to please the Wizard and \"mydlink\", however .... still no video on the \"mydlink\" site.  Just a black screen counting down from 60 seconds.OK, so I more or less gave up on \"mydlink\".... maybe I can still use this from a PC...But no, it doesn't end there.  In the Web interface of the camera itself (i.e., not the Wizard), it *is* possible to set up WiFi, and yes, I can get video and audio, night vision, and the quality is not bad (audio does have background noise as reported in the other reviews, but I was not bothered about that).  However it seems almost impossible to set the admin password (even to something alphanumeric, with only lower case letters!) and still be able to log out and log in again.  So if you are OK with an empty password field to your camera watching your kid, then fine.  But if you want a real password....OK.  So after quite a few hours.  A night ruined.  I guess I'll just return this.  Amazon is pretty good about that right?  Well this is Circuit City.  And they are not pretty good about that.  They are awful about it.  Their policy is that you need to call the manufacturer and get a \"defect confirmation\".  Once you do that, you can call them so they can give you an RMA number to get a replacement.  Have you ever tried to get a consumer electronics manufacturer to confirm a software defect in writing?  Do you think the replacement from Circuit City is going to have that software fixed?(For the record, no, there is not a firmware update.  Yes, I did enable UPnP.  Yes I did verify that the port can be connected to remotely.  Yes, I did revert the device to factory defaults ten or twenty times.)Friends in the world, I recommend you AVOID this one.", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "TERRIBLE SUPPORT", "Author": "Zelyntor", "ReviewID": "R1AP8EM90PO5L0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "DLINK DCS-930lI use this camera when we go on vacation - maybe once or twice a year, so I'm not exactly a Dlink professional every time I want to set it up.

Besides, I have Wine installed on my Mac and can generally run installers just fine, and as a backup I have an old PC.Although the wine solution didn't work, with a quick look on D-Link's site, I found that they have published a Mac-native installer as of 1/21/2011!I downloaded the installer and plugged the camera into my router via Ethernet.

I must say I am completely impressed and glad I bought it.I simply wanted a camera for my front door so I could screen solicitors.  What I got was way more!  The ability to view the cam from your iPhone or Android via WiFi or 3G works great.  Also, being alerted by email when motion is detected is awesome.  It sends you 6 photos per event!  The night mode is also worth it.  I'll catch the cat that's peeing on my doormat yet!D-Link now has a Mac installation download so if you are a Mac user, go here and skip the CD that came in the box.

After initial set up, you can change it to wireless.When you are viewing the cam from your local network on your iPhone or iPad using the mydlink app, the video and audio comes in very quickly.  When you are outside of your network, be patient.  It can take up to 30 seconds for the video to start.Briefly, some of the features I love:* iPhone and Android \"mydlink\" apps for remote viewing* mydlink.com for viewing in a browser remotely, from anywhere!* Daytime video quality* Motion sensor with automatic email of 6 photos* Wireless N networking* Lots of cool settings to customize* Ease of set-upSome things that could be better:* It would be cool if they made an outdoor version of this cam.  I use it on my covered front porch.  I wouldn't use it outside unprotected.* It needs to be plugged into an outlet.

It was a bit less expensive and lacked the night capabilities; otherwise was almost identical.  I spent FOUR hours trying to get that camera up and running, and was forced to go through incredibly painful exercises like learning to \"port forward\".  Laugh it up techie nerds, sure that is 2nd nature for you, but the majority of us \"port forward\" sounds like a location on a ship.Installation was literally as easy as following the 3 step quick start guide (basically plug in the camera, put in the install disk, and follow the directions as prompted from there).  The software that is bundled with the product is outstanding in that it walks you right through everything in simple terms, and the result is a wireless camera that you can view anywhere in the world.  I literally was up and running and able to view the camera on external machines and my phone within 10 minutes of opening the box.The product is oriented (naturally) to using the \"MyDlink\" software and website.  That is a critical piece that makes all of the \"easy\" stuff possible.  You can manage the camera settings and view what is going on from anywhere in the world.  By the way, if you just want to use the camera infrequently and guarantee that people won't be spying on you in your PJs (and let's face it, it could be much worse than that!), you can simply unplug the power to the camera and plug it back in when you want it on.  AND you can unplug it from one location in your house and move to another - no additional \"fiddling\" required.The Android application can be downloaded for free in the Android Marketplace.  This software works well but it does not allow the user to listen to audio or to enable recording to your handheld device.  As an alternative, you can use the \"IP Cam Viewer\" application and pay a few bucks to enable audio and recording capabilities, but that unfortunately strays from the magic \"DLink\" software and requires ... you guessed it ... more difficult port forwarding, etc.  In addition, you cannot use other brands of cameras with the DLink software.  You can certainly use different brands on the same network, but again that requires the more detailed network setup knowledge.  But for just using the DLink camera, you can just install the DLink app, sign in with your Dlink username and password, and presto - you can see images live on your phone!As others have noticed, the audio quality crackles, but it is good enough to roughly hear what is going on.  For the most part, I don't envision really using this feature (and don't think it would be that useful even if it was pro-audio quality ... the video is what is important).Video quality is excellent considering the price point of this camera.  My other camera (competing product) required manually focusing the camera with a wheel, which is a pain.  This camera has perfect focus for all distances right out of the box.  Night-time vision works surprisingly well.  You can tweak the settings, but out-of-the-box the camera worked great and had a sharp image for a variety of lighting conditions.The motion detection works well but is a bit difficult to setup with my normal email account.  I wound up establishing another email service for this function.  This was the only part of the setup that was not straightforward.In summary, the product works great, is easy to use, and is highly recommended.", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, works great!!!", "Author": "FordFasteRR", "ReviewID": "R2X9EH9HEXL5UZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have installed 15 of these cameras.

I manually configured each of the cameras to static IP and connect via the main PC.  No problems at all and I use an external USB 2tb hard drive to store the recorded video.  The D-View Cam software automatically finds the cameras and allows you to configure them without knowing the IP address. **I also hooked up a few of these cameras at home and view them from my Android cell phone using IP Cam Viewer Lite and everything is working flawlessly.I am using them indoors and I have noticed that it does not like ultra-bright light such as direct sunlight shining through a window so I angled them in a way as to prevent the light from directly hitting the camera and the image is good.Also, the default resolution is set to about half out of the box, I changed it to maximum and the quality is much better than the old analog video camera system that I previously used.**One thing that is not mentioned is how to get the IP address of the camera.

A little bit of background, I have an iPhone and a MAC OSX. So, to begin with, I required a camera that worked with both. After an article I read, I quickly came across this camera. It seemed like it would work with the iPhone and OSX, D-Link has an app for the camera. However, I had already purchased iCam for the iPhone and was really hoping I could get it to work with that. So here is what I did:1) I plugged the camera with the ethernet cable into my Apple Time Machine.2) I then plugged the camera into the power outlet.3) I went into my Network configurations on OSX and found the IP address of the camera.It came up after about 1 minute.4) Once I had the IP address, I entered it into Safari. Default login info is admin (lower case) with NO password. At this point, it is important to note that I did NOT run the included CD to get the IP address, nor did I install that CD, nor did I install the OSX application I had to download, nor did I sign up with the D-Link website. I had read somewhere that someone was getting a call from their internet service provider for having had too much network traffic going out of their house, so I didn't want that. But more importantly I did not want to sign up with D-Link and have my videos posted via their website, meaning I never created an account with D-Link. So basically, I have a stream that is only visible on my network, not outside (the iCam application on my computer however let's me stream to my iPhone over 3G).5) I changed the default password, I think you cannot have any special characters in it as I had to reset the camera when I did that.6) Then I entered my hidden wireless network and my WPA2 Personal password, restarted the camera.7) I could already see my video on Safari.8) Then I added this camera along with its password into the iCam application that resides on my Mac. I used the iCam support page to get the default URL for the streaming video and the first 2 worked. This URL I entered into the iCam software on the Mac.9) Boom, I was done, iCam on iPhone streamed video to my iPhone.This of course means that I have to have my computer turned on the whole time, which negates another positive of the camera, in that, if you follow their instructions, you do not need to have your computer turned on but you need to sign up with them.

With two dogs alone in the house I was hoping to watch them and be sure that my home is safe.Pros: It works.  Although it functions at a low quality of video and sound, you can see whatever it is that you want to see.  I can watch my dogs wander or see that my front door is securely shut with my valuables in place.  Only once has the camera refused to load on my iPhone app but other than that it has worked flawlessly.  Setup is easy as long as you follow the directions and it's extremely simple once it's setup.

The camera could be viewed over the internet, and that was about it.  I couldn't get it to email me photos, nor could I get it to store movies on the micro SD card.  After updating the firmware to version 1.12 the situation got better, and now the camera appears to work acceptably, although not quite as well I would like.The things that I like about it are that it is very flexible, offering a choice of saving photos or short movies to a variety of storage destinations (FTP, email, SD card), and it does deliver an image in near dark thanks to the IR capability.The not-so-impressive things are many, however.1. Image quality is so-so (only 640 x 480, and not very sharp at that)2. Wireless performance is not great (barely able to transfer a live image unless the camera is in the same room as the router in our house).3. When you log in to view the camera it transfers your password in the clear (seriously? this is a security product?).4. It switches into IR mode in all but the brightest situations.5. The field of view is not very wide.  I would estimate it at around the equivalent of a standard 50mm normal lens.6. The shutter speed is slow in most situations (meaning that people are blurred if they're moving at all).7. Finally the camera mount is pretty flimsy and doesn't like to hold it's position very well.The support for the Mac platform is adequate but not extensive; they have a camera utility that runs on Mac OS X, but you have to go their web site to get it.  The MyDlink feature works OK; I can view the camera from my iPhone and listen to the room where the camera is situated.Would I buy it again?  Maybe.

Now the price is $150, and at that price it isn't necessarily a great deal.", "Date": "August 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Night Surveillance ... not!", "Author": "LucianG", "ReviewID": "R26JC4AOP3GUYE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Just to clarify, this is a review for DCS-932L - Amazon (or the users) posted here reviews for DCS-930L too.The camera setup was extremely easy, no software needed. Just connect the camera (wired) to the router and point any browser to its IP address to get the web management GUI. The camera comes with DHCP enabled and the IP address depends on the router settings but it should be easy to find in the router's log. If connected directly to a PC (no DHCP available) the camera IP should be 192.168.0.20. Subsequently, the wireless settings can be changed from the web GUI. For people using MAC filtering, it seems the camera has same MAC address for both wireless and wired connection. Once getting the camera \"talking\" all the settings are intuitive.The camera works well for daytime and/or good light conditions. I added it to a ZoneMinder system and does what is supposed to do. Didn't try audio (no need for my application) or any advanced camera functions like email or motion detection because ZoneMinder does all of that more advanced, in one place, for multiple sources. Also, I didn't try access from the Internet (mydlink) since the ZoneMinder server does that too. I believe I observed a feature worth noting - while testing different settings I somehow managed to lock up the camera, and it was not communicating anymore. However, after about 1 minute or so, judging by the LED status, the camera decided to reboot itself and came back online shortly after, no action needed on my part.Now, the deal breaker!The camera is terrible in poor light conditions. The sensor is listed at '1 Lux @ F2.8' but I believe this doesn't mean much because additional parameters missing (Color temperature, Video level, Reflection ratio). And, of course it is listed at '0 Lux with IR LED on'. The problem with the 'IR LED' is there are not Infra-Red, they are Red! In Night mode the camera turns on 4 red LEDs - if really IR, the light should be outside the visible spectrum. I could understand how this is a commercial decision, these LEDs could be cheaper, and at the same time prevent uninformed users from returning the camera because \"the LED don't work, 'cause I see no IR\". However, having 4 red lights on all the time at night makes it annoying for any people also using the area. The power LED can be turned off in settings but the red LEDs are managed by the night mode and that will take some complicated scheduling to prevent the nuisance. So, for indoor areas can't really use at night inconspicuously, and the only function I could think of is baby monitor, maybe.Turning the attention to outside areas, for egress monitoring - this also runs into major problems at night. The camera is not designed for outdoor, so even if some users got lucky and it worked outside for a while, I don't plan to take a chance with that. Thus, I had to install the camera inside, behind a window, and during daytime there are no major problems with that. However, during nighttime the camera can't be used at all. The combination of poor AF and \"IR\" reflections in the window makes the camera show the spots on the window, instead of outside objects, even if they are illuminated well. A real surveillance camera should focus on objects at a relatively longer range, not on the dust streaks on the enclosure glass, 1/2\" in front of the camera. Switching the \"IR\" off improves the situation a bit, less reflections on the window, but the camera sensor sensitivity is so poor the resulting image is not stable (horizontal lines, artifacts) unless there is significant light outside. In summary, the \"night mode\" only works if there is \"day mode\" lighting outside.In conclusion, this seems to be an average webcam mounted on a network adapter and with 4 LEDs around the objective; the \"night\" function is a joke.I am returning it (5 starts to Amazon for delivery and return services).", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works well.

The two are very different, but for my purposes, the D-Link cameras are actually more useful.Connectivity: Both offer 802.11N 2.4GHz connectivity, which is fine except when there are many networks nearby and frequency congestion becomes a problem; 5 GHz would be much better, but isn't offered.  Neither camera streams effectively with a weak signal.  The DCS-942L can capture to the SD card, which is good to have if the signal is iffy.  The DCS-942L also has a wired ethernet port.  For your sanity, use wired ethernet if at all possible.  (With Dropcam you have no choice but to use wireless.)Optics: The DCS-942L is VGA quality only, not 720p.  But the lens on the Dropcam is wider angle, so the level of detail on objects is the same--the Dropcam simply shows more of the room.  For a camera pointed directly at a door or hallway, it won't really matter.  The bigger improvement comes from 1080p cameras such as the DCS-2230 which I also own.Night vision: The DCS-942L has much better night vision than the DropCam.  The DCS-942L has four LEDs that glow rather noticeably; DropCam HD has several (maybe ten) behind tinted plastic that is more stealthy but blocks a lot of the light.  Consequently, DropCam HD's night vision in mediocre, while the DCS-942L has good night vision for indoors.Live viewing: I use a Mac and an Airport Express router which does not support UPNP for on-the-fly port mapping.  Therefore the MyDlink service will not stream video above 320x240 because it is relayed through the MyDlink website first.  I find MyDlink kind of useless and just use the camera's built-in Web server for control.  Dropcam streams continuously to their cloud service and does not depend on any special configuration for your router.  They use Flash video for playback.Playback: Dropcam shows the entire recorded video, either 7 days or 30 days, on a timeline view, which makes it really easy and fast to navigate.  If you receive a motion alert via e-mail, you click the link in the e-mail to go straight to the video when the motion occurred.  The DCS-942L will e-mail you up to a 10-second video file, between 200K-2MB depending on settings and degree of motion,  and you have to then go to the mydlink.com web site, access the camera's Web server directly, or go to your NAS if you have one to get the full-length video.  However, because my DCS-942L's are set to record on motion, they have clips on the SD cards from as long as three months ago.  (The D-link cameras automatically throw away old video clips to make room as needed.)Motion detection: The D-Link camera offers very flexible video motion detection where you can draw a specific region in the picture to capture movement.  There are firmware issues in the D-Link when using highly irregular regions shapes, so keep the motion regions simple and rectangular.  Both D-Link and DropCam HD, but especially the DCS-942L, have some trouble in very low lighting conditions, such as late afternoon indoors, and false trigger on video motion.  On the DCS-942L, I had to set the sensitivity to 30-35% to stop it, but then the camera wouldn't detect any motion at all!  For best results, use a normally bright region of the picture for the motion detection.  Dropcam's video motion has no sensitivity or region adjustment but works pretty well, false triggering once or twice per day in early morning and evening.  Unlike DropCam HD, the DCS-942L offers passive infrared (PIR) motion detection using a separate, dedicated infrared detector on the front of the camera.  On the Medium or Low settings, it triggers reliably with ZERO observed false positives in my experience.  High sensitivity will false trigger in very cold weather.  PIR does not work through windows.  Neither camera has I/O ports for connecting external sensors.Long-term cost: Once you buy the D-Link camera, it's yours.  You record to an SD card or to a NAS on your network as your DVR.  There are third-party services that stream 24/7 from the D-Link cameras to provide offsite DVR also.  To do any recording with DropCam, you have to pay monthly fees that, for the 30-day plan, exceed the cost of the camera in about a year.  You also need to upgrade your cable service if you have more than one or two Dropcams.  With DropCam, you pay for simplicity and convenience at the expense of configurability.Scalability: Local recording means no bandwidth usage on your home Internet connection unless you are watching a live feed from outside your network, whereas the Dropcams use bandwidth 24/7.  You can record continuously to files on an SD card (each file up to 6 minutes) for weeks at a time, and the camera rotates the oldest recordings out automatically.  If you're technically inclined, you could set up a Linux box with ZoneMinder and add other types of cameras to the mix later, whereas Dropcam doesn't offer that possibility.  Dropcam scales poorly because the Internet connectivity must support constant streaming from all cameras.  I had trouble with WiFi performance and video stream stutter with both types of cameras when I had multiple streams running from any sort of distance.  If you can do so, run Ethernet to the cameras.  For just one or two you should be fine with wireless.Support: I haven't needed Dropcam support yet because the product is pretty solid.  The D-Link e-mail support is laughable and reminds me of the old DOS days when the solution to all problems was to reboot.  If you find a firmware bug (I've found several), they just tell you to reset everything to factory defaults and try again.  Once you do that, and find the bug again, you just have to cross your fingers that they fix it.Summary: If you are not technically inclined, it's hard to beat the ease of setup of the Dropcam HD.  It just works with no fooling around and has a great web-based interface.  If you are willing to tinker with the sittings directly through the onboard Web server, the D-Link cameras have more flexibility and no recurring cost.After living with my setup for over a year, I suggest setting up a micro recording server or NAS for centralized control.  Beyond a few cameras it starts to get really cumbersome to have each camera mapped out through the router on its own port with its own SD storage.  Also, if you have the cameras in your home and don't want to be bombarded with clips of yourself constantly, you'll find yourself unplugging the cameras and having to plug them back in.  A centrally-managed setup with multiple profile such as Blue Iris would be less irritating.If you are willing to forego on-camera SD card storage, there are many IP cameras such as the ones from Dahua with much better image quality and night vision for not much more money.  For stand-alone use of one or two, they're a decent value.The attached 10-second video is the longest that the camera will send via e-mail when it detects motion.  It will simultaneously record up to 1 minute to the SD card, or record to the SD card 24/7.", "Date": "March 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for outdoor house security", "Author": "Vamp", "ReviewID": "R1VZEWKXZ32JEH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Using for: Outside- Residential Front and Backdoor security (wifi / IP)-Pros: Price, Easy Install (prior networking knowledge), Great Video Software, iPhone & brower viewing, Great night vision, Great quality video/picture, good frames per second-Cons: Power Cord length, No wind screen to prevent wind noise on Mic, If outside the sun conditions will ALMOST wash out the area in the direct sun (Sunrise/Sunset) But you can still make out faces.

Viewing angle not the best for outdoors, but tolerable.--------------------------------------------------------I was looking for some security cameras for some time when I finally came across this IP(wifi) camera. The install CD takes you step by step on setting it up. (Plug this in, click continue, unplug this, etc). Had a few hickups, but it was my router settings.I bought 2 of these at an office supply store. One for the front yard and one for the backyard (how to weatherproof at very bottom of review). For the front yard I have it between my security door and my front door. So no one can tamper with the unit and my door is covered by a patio overhang. The powercord goes over the door and inside the house to an outlet (with an extension cord of course).I have both cameras set up to record (with included software on local PC) when it senses movement in designated areas. If you go to the cameras IP address on your local network you can get into the settings and have it email/text you images if it senses movement in more designated areas (different from the program). I have it text me 6 pictures of the movement 2 before and 3 after the movement. To have it text you, find your carriers email address that allows you to do this. IE: I use ATT so I have it send to xxxxxxxxxx@mms.att.net (x's denote your cell number). So you'll get a text instead of an email.I ran into one problem with the video feed lagging when I tried to watch both feeds at the same time on the software. I narrowed it down to the router channel it uses to transmit wifi signal. It was on 11 and I switched it to 1, worked like a charm. Both cameras are being viewed Highest resolution and quality and Frames per second.I tried this camera for the inside the house and it works better than as an outside camera. Definitly a great IP camera.(Optional Reading. DIY Weather proofing this camera)The backdoor I had to make it weatherproof and night vision to still work behind the plexiglass.- 2\"x2\"x4\" plastic junction box (home depot)- Lexon (plexiglass) sheet- outdoor extension cord- gap filler (yellow can)First I cut the lexan to be the same size as the cover of the box. Drilled a hole in the bottom for the extension cord to fit into the box. Plugged the power supply from the camera and the extension cord inside the box. Used the gap filler to fill in the gab between the hole and the cord to make it weather proof (wait for it to cure). Put the entire powersupply cord inside the box and the camera ontop of it (had to remove the bracket on the back of the camera with a vice). Put the lexon glass ontop and screwed it in (there is a rubber gasket provided). Then clear silicon around the glass to further weather proof it. Now the camera is sitting flush with the plexiglass so the night vision IR doent bounce off the glass and back at it self. So it works perfectly for my application.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lousy customer service, minimal Mac support, it works-barely", "Author": "Richard L.

I finally installed a third party software program to enable motion detection much better than their software did. Everything was fine until we had a power outage and the camera would not reconnect to the network. Dlink told me it was my wireless router and hurried me off the phone. It is not my router. The fourth tech I called told me I was typing in my IP address incorrectly when in fact the software should detect the network settings automatically and I know how to type in the ip address correctly.  He hurried me off the phone as well saying he would escalate my call to a tech who would call me back within the hour. I got a callback three hours later and the tech said he would send some setup program via email. I still don't have the app and the camera is still not networked. I think the camera is fine but their support is poor. I am going to choose another brand and chalk this up to a lesson learned.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "DCS-942L as a burglar alarm", "Author": "Dan Thomas", "ReviewID": "R2IV0BS4Y81VXG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this item yesterday and immediately started to set it up.  I had compared this camera to the Foscam's and Dropcam and I bought this because of the wealth of information at the dlink site.  Also, it looked like it would fulfill my needs.I have an older router that doesn't support WPS.  WPS enables you to push a button on the router to set up the camera automatically.  I needed to physically connect the camera via the supplied Cat 5 cable to the router itself (not my PC).  But there is a label on the camera over the power and ethernet port that notifies you to install the CD first.The CD walked me through the installation process with no difficulty.  I then went looking to see if there is a firmware upgrade.  I found one on their site and downloaded it and browsed for it in the camera's web interface.  That didn't work and luckily it reverted back to the old firmware.If you have registered the camera with Dlink (I suggest registering), then the mydlink site will upgrade the firmware for you.  They also warn that the ethernet cable needs to be connected to the router, which I didn't do during the manual firmware upgrade.With the firmware upgraded, I moved the camera to the area that I wanted to monitor, then got the IP address of the camera from my router and pointed my tablet to that URL (use \"https://) so that I could set the viewing area.I wanted it to e-mail me video clips when it detected motion, so I pulled my account data from the t-bird e-mail account settings and tested it.  The test sends a photo.Somewhere along the way I also set up network time protocol (NTP) and pointed it to Dlink's NTP site.  That way you get the correct time on the video within a few secondes.There are 4 different video recording/playback modes that you can set.  It actually captures video in all 4 modes at once.  For an e-mail of a video, you might want a little bit lower quality and resolution than if you are monitoring it in your own house over your wireless.  In fact, you can point Real Player at it and select which video mode you want to monitor (URL rtsp://<camera_IP_address>/mode)I put a 16 GB micro SD card in it so that the video would be permanently captured.  You can record to the SD card only when there is motion detected and this is a great option for setting up the motion detection.  You can then go through the captures (a little over a minute per capture) and make sure that recording only triggers on the events that you want.  In my case I set up for PIR motion detection only at low sensitivity, since I only want it to detect motion 5-15 feet away.  After reviewing some of the videos, it only triggers when one of us is walking through the room and not the ceiling fan.  It hasn't been through a thunder storm yet.When the camera detected motion, I wanted 2 things to happen:1. I would recieve an SMS text on my iphone at <my_phone_number>@txt.att.net2. My g-mail account would get a 10 second video.The text message would alert me to check the e-mailed video.  Unfortunately, it seems that you can't add 2 e-mail addresses in the e-mail setup.  Nor can you select both a video and a snapshot to be sent, one to one address and the other to another.  I got around this by setting up my g-mail account to forward the e-mail to my SMS text message account.  While I can't see the video in the text message, the text message informs me in no uncertain terms that motion has been detected.  Then I can revert to e-mail and watch the video.Other nice features are that you can set up a schedule when it will record to the SD card or send e-mails when it detects motion.  I haven't spent a lot of time playing with mydlink on their website, but it doesn't seem to be nearly as sophisticated as the camera's own web interface.  The thing to do might be to set up IP forwarding on the router as others have suggested and access the camera itself remotely.Maybe I will report back on it after I have some more experience with it.  But, for now and for the price, I am pretty happy7/30/2013 update.  We went through a terrific thunderstorm last night with lightning close by.  The only time the PIR detection triggered was when my wife walked past a couple of times.  Also, when you log out of the web interface and it warns you to close the browser, do what it says!  I was trying to permanently set its IP address on the router and couldn't get back into it with firefox.  I brought IE up and logged in.  I thought that I was going to have to figure out how to factory reset it.  Another good thing is that by default it responds to ping.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!

One of them recently stopped working, so I decided to replace it with the DCS-930L. The 920 has an external WiFi antenna, and the 930L does not, so I was interested to see how strong the signal would be on the new camera.I received it and connected it to my D-Link DIR-628 wireless router and immediately noticed that the 930L's Signal(%) reading was about 30% and the transmitted image was very jerky - about one image every 2-3 seconds with complete freezes of 4-5 seconds. My 920, connected to the same router with the same image quality and size settings was showing 100% signal and streaming fluid video.  The 920, by the way, was also located twice as far from the router as the 930L. I actually moved the router so that it was within 10 feet of the 930L with a clear line of sight - and that only improved the Signal(%) value to about 60%.I called D-Link support and they had me upgrade the firmware for the 930L. That didn't improve things, so they told me it must be a hardware problem and gave me a support reference number and told me to return it. Amazon quickly shipped a new one which just arrived this afternoon. I set it up with the same D-Link router and am seeing exactly the same poor performance.So now I'll be returning two units instead of one. I'm very disappointed that D-Link would release a product that's so obviously broken.

I was convinced any of these similar devices were pure crap. But this has not only turned me around but made me an enthusiast. THIS is how it is \"supposed\" to be done in my opinion.  NO hidden fees & costs. NO taking my credit card number for some SO CALLED FREE service!, NO problems our hours trying to troubleshoot and end up never getting installed. NO hours on the phone with tech support....Nope. This took less than 15 minutes, was almost as simple as plug- n- play, and woks. Just plain & simply works.  I can't address sending images to cell phones etc since my use is as a garage monitor & UPS lookout device. When it is hot I like to leave my garage door open and not worry about who enters to help themselves to my toys. I also want to know who is near my driveway so If my doorbell rings I know to answer it or if I am wasting my time dealing with some religious nut trying to save my soul...So my use is far from what the mainstream is I am sure. What I love is that this really allows me to do all I need and to even set \"motion zones\" with free software you download to add to this camera.  Plus It has the ability to record directly from the camera to a local hard drive, trigger motion detection, set recording schedules, set e-mail alert notifications, and even support for up to 32 cameras. Best part unlike my last nightmare with Archerfish, I can record video directly to a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device, eliminating the need for a dedicated computer to store video. You set up any \"zones\" where motion will trip recording with FREE software. THIS is how I wanted in the first place!  If you choose, you can have emails sent and configure this almost any way imaginable. Again, quick, clean and SIMPLE! No hidden fees, costs, traps or hassles. As a baby or Nanny cam, this would be amazing. In my case, I just have neighbors to worry about....The picture is nice for this price camera. Low light performance is good as well. I use it in wireless mode and no problems at all. It does require plugging into a wall socket to power so that is a consideration for camera placement. The camera also has a light that flashes when recording so that is nice as well for someone wondering about privacy?

Bad decision. This is everything everyone else complains about, and less. First off, the construction is cheap. I have several DCS-932L's, and the ball joint on those is metal. I guess D-Link decided to save money, and changed it to a piece of nylon junk. This joint feels very fragile in your hands, and doesn't seem to want to tighten up. I was fearful I would break it just trying to get it tight enough to hold the camera up. This camera also seems less stable on it's base than the 932L.Now came the fun part.... Since I already own several 932L's, I was already familiar with the setup, and MyDlink.Com. I noticed upon powering it up that the firmware was at v1.00. As an I.T. guy, I am always concerned about running the first version of anything. I noticed that the 942L didn't automatically ask about updating the firmware (like the 932L does). I decided to see if I could manually find it. The link in the help screen took me to a site that was in Chinese. Nice. When I went to the D-Link support site (U.S.) I couldn't find a firmware file anywhere. I finally googled it and found in on the MyDlink site. I updated the firmware to v1.01. Newer... but just barely. Maybe when they get to v 1.2 it will be better???The real headaches began when trying to make changes to the camera settings. Nine times out of ten, it would timeout during 'Saving', and display 'Page cannot be displayed' in IE. Obviously, there are issues with the built-in web part of the firmware.

Hanenkamp", "ReviewID": "R2P9P3O6TBN84Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this device to use as a baby monitor to replace a wireless camera we bought at a garage sale whose DC plug was starting to short out. Based upon my experience with audio and video baby monitors, I can tell you that both the audio and video quality of this is device is excellent. The day mode color is great. The night mode is nice and bright, the infrared LEDs easily shine bright enough for the camera to be placed 6-8 feet away (much better than the previous infrared video camera I had which had to be right next to the crib). The audio is great. I see some folks complaining about static or other issues, but the only static I hear on the audio is from the white noise machine in the baby's room. When that's off, the audio is not perfectly silent but pretty good for a cheap webcam mike.Setup was not difficult for me, but I used to be a systems administrator and maintain my own home network and have a custom-built phone system. Setting up this camera is not quite what I would call \"Do-It-Yourself\" for the typical home owner with a wifi network. To set it up, you have to plug it into your network using an ethernet cable (provided) first. You then run the setup software. I mostly use Apple computers and the CD did not come with Apple software, so I had to go their web site, navigate the web site to the support page, find the software and download it (that was a chore all by itself).The setup software worked once installed, but again had some problems because it had to upgrade the firmware and then I had to get a different version of the setup software running to setup the camera, which was a little weird. Once I did that, it detected the camera and setup the mydlink account with very little effort. However, it does nothing to help with the rest of the setup, like turning on the wireless. There's no helpful wizard or instructions on how to use the camera as a wifi device (which is not even turned on by default). To do that, I had to click around and figure out how to get to the Advanced Settings myself and then look around those and set it up to use the wifi network. The settings look very much like what you'd expect if you have set up a D-Link or similar router, but, again, not something I'd expect a typical home owner with a wifi network to operate.As with so many computer electronics hardware, the manufacturer has spent a most of the time developing this product focused on the hardware. The device looks attractive, the base is stable, the camera itself is of sturdy construction, and the components, while cheap, do the job and work well together. The software, on the other hand, is clunky and inconsistent. The various viewers all support different features, which just a little strange. Even the Java applet for viewing it online versus the Java applet for viewing it locally have different features. You can take a screenshot from the iPad, but you can't from the Java applets on the PC. There are two different Android applications, one is Free and one costs $0.99, but they don't really tell you what the difference is (the $0.99 seems to be tablet oriented while the Free one seems to be phone oriented, but they are almost like different apps for doing the same thing with completely different UIs). I have not tried the ActiveX control for using the camera, but I suspect that it is yet again different from the Java applet. The setup utility is badly documented in certain places. For example, do you want to know what motion detection will do when turned on? You'll just have to guess because I don't know and nothing I've found in the app, in the manual, or on the D-Link web site says what it does. I don't need it, so I don't really care, but seems like it ought to at least tell me what its good for if I think I might.I very much like the fact that it supports Android, iPad, Apple, and PC and accessing the camera remotely from the mydlink web site. This is wonderful. The fact that it supports remote access is even better. This to me is the killer feature of this device. However, one does need to be a little careful. If you are at home on your home network, do not use the mydlink web site to watch the camera. Go directly to the camera (which might require figuring out what IP address your camera is assigned). I found that with just 2 systems watching the camera (a laptop and an iPad), my internet connection slowed to a crawl and I have a pretty big 12 Mbps downlink, which means it was sucking up a huge chunk of my bandwidth. I fixed the problem by using my in-house DNS server to assign the system a name and setting up user accounts, so my wife can now login to view the camera by sending her browser over to (...), actually that's not the name I used, but you get the gist). The iPad will still use the mydlink site, but that's tolerable since its just one device--however, I write web and mobile device software for a living and this does not need to be the case, it should detect and use the local camera feed if on the same network.Overall, I'd say you get what you pay for. If you're expecting image and sound quality that knocks your socks off, why are you paying $100 or less for this camera? You need something at least 2-times this price to get the kind of CCD and microphones capable of producing better quality. This is essentially a glorified a security camera. The goal is not image or sound quality. However, having easy access everywhere once its setup from a variety of devices is just incredible for this price point. People giving this 2 stars, in my opinion, is applying a $500 device expectation to a $100 device.I give it 4 stars because of: (1) marketing it as a DIY install, which I think is a pretty stretch given the effort required to set it up, and (2) because of the mediocre software and web site. Fix either of these, and I give it 5 stars. I'd actually take away a star for each of those, but for the fact that it supports Android, iPad, iPhone, PC, and Mac and has a web site for getting access to the camera from anywhere. That takes a lot of effort to accomplish, so I will give an extra star. If they fixed those two problems, I would ask Amazon to tack on a 6th star.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Airport extreme setup", "Author": "Matt Shaw", "ReviewID": "R6LZI16408BE4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I read a few reviews about problems with Mac:I have a Macbook Pro and Airport extreme router.

I set it up to work wirelessly and everything worked great until the end of July 2013.  One day I went to fire up the mydlink app on my phone and it said the camera wasn't available.  No problem, I thought, I'll just go and unplug/reboot the camera we'll be all set.  Came back on, connected to my network again and the light went green.  Problem solved, right?  Wrong.  5 minutes later the camera was unavailable again.Being an IT professional, I figure there must be a firmware update for the camera or something to that effect, so I go out and update the camera to the newest version as magically I can still access the camera on my wireless network, it's just not communicating with the dlink site to display the image.  Same problem still occurs.  At this point I have no option but to call Dlink support.Talk about a hassle and a half.  After specifically being transferred to another department because \"they handle the support for this particular camera\" (means it must be a very special camera right?) I was put on hold for 30 minutes.  I had enough time to cook dinner for my family and sit down to eat before support came on the line.Then it was 30 minutes of troubleshooting at which point they told me I needed to plug the camera directly into the router to continue troubleshooting.  Why?  I bought this solely so I could use it wirelessly, obviously it's not working with wifi.  This was no small task as I had mounted this camera up high near the ceiling in my newborn's room.  I finally did a couple days later and called them back, and still nothing changed after another 45 minutes of troubleshooting tasks.  Finally I demanded to talk to the person's supervisor at which point she informs me she had just received authorization to RMA the product and send me a new one.  How convenient.Bottom line is I will never buy Dlink products again.  Got burned with a router a few years back, and now this defective piece of junk.

Not to mention if the \"easy\" setup was this flawed, then I wasn't sure that my camera would be secure on dlink's site. They seemed to have numerous issues that did not instill confidence. I fear that my camera feed would not be secure.Too bad this camera didn't work because this was a good idea.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dissappointing performance and no scheduled motion detection", "Author": "zablalbaz \"zab\"", "ReviewID": "R26JUJ19CJ1YW0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I suppose for the purpose of being able to open a web browser and view my children with their babysitter, it does an ok job.  Not great and the frames/second could be a bit more, but still usable.  That, however, is all I the good I have to say about this camera.  After playing around with it and upgrading the firmware, I have decided to purchase a different camera for the remainder of my setup at home.Here are the issues I have chosen as the most disappointing to me:1.  The wireless antenna range is just not that good. I have two access points at either side of my home providing complete coverage.  Every other wireless device and camera in the household is able to attach to the APs and obtain IP addresses.  This camera needs to be within 20-30 feet of an AP to work. I have a two year old smart phone and an ancient PDA that do better.2.  The audio is horrible.  Doesn't matter what browser/device I use to watch the stream.3.  And most importantly to me - there is no ability to set the camera up via its integrated firmware menu to do motion detection on a scheduled basis.In the setup menu I can set up a schedule where pictures are taken at regular intervals during specific times of the day. OR I can set up motion detection to snap pictures and send them out whenever motion is detected.  BUT I cannot have motion detection on a schedule at certain times of the day.  Why is this bad?  Because when motion detection is on, it is ON all the time. Including when I may be at home moving around in front of the camera.  And when it detects motion, it takes A LOT of pictures.  If the camera is set up to email the pictures somewhere offsite, the traffic can flood the network or spam an email account offline. In my opinion a good wireless camera should include a scheduled motion detection feature that can be enabled WITHIN its integrated firmware menu.For these reasons I give this webcam an overall rating of 1 star.  I'm not sure at this point if I can send it back since I have had it so long.  I'll try.  If not, then it will remain a \"nanny cam\" until such a time that D-Link sees fit to add the functionality for scheduled motion detection.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Does not work wireless", "Author": "Al", "ReviewID": "RB2CBIE9E8EPR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have been trying to get this to work wireless for 4 weeks.

Morris", "ReviewID": "RYLJOAH7RTWCN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First, it's possible that maybe I just got a dud. However, from reading other reviews, it seems I'm not alone. I could replace this camera with another, but instead, I'll get a refund and search for another model. Still, the features I could see looked nice, even if they weren't able to actually work. Here are some problems I faced. * After being on for a few minutes, the camera would lose network connectivity, forcing me to restart it (by unplugging the power) to make it usable again. I'm not sure if this depends on what type of scene it is aimed at or not, but it definitely wasn't going to work for me.* The device was never able to find my wireless network--or any others, for that matter. I had to use the wired connection. This was not a configuration issue on either end. Even after a reset and making sure my network was in the 2.4 GHz bands of 802.11n (and b/g), this camera could not find it--or any of my neighbors' that my computer can also see. My SSID contained only letters, no spaces or symbols.The above made it pretty useless for me. However, here are a few good things about it that I was able to discover:* You do not need to use D-Link's software to set up or manage the camera. There is a Web interface. You'll just need to find the camera's IP address and view it in a Web browser (you can do the same with most network printers, for example). If you don't know how to do this, however, you might be better just using their software. The one on the CD only works with Windows. Some of their cameras have Mac versions available on their website; I didn't care enough to look since you don't need it.* You don't *have* to use D-Link's cloud/MyD-Link service. However, again, if you're not comfortable setting up your own alternative, you might want to. What I did (with great difficulty given how finicky the camera was) was set up an FTP server on my home LAN for a file share I could access with a username and password I used just for this purpose. You can configure the camera to upload images via FTP. (You can also do e-mail if you provide SMTP server info.) I didn't want to expose this publicly, which is fine for the camera itself since it's also on my LAN. To view when I was away, I VPNed (via a separate service I configured) into my home LAN and then connected to the file share. Obviously, an off-site solution would be better, but this is the best I could do. And of course, the average person will not want to do this--but I just wanted to note that you don't *need* D-Link's offerings. You can save either on a timer (every 'x' seconds) or via motion detection. I was never able to get motion detection to work before the camera crashed.* For remote viewing of the camera live, I'd rather go via the previous method of images the camera saved (not quite live but close), but I could also use the camera's Web interface and view either a still image (refreshing as needed) or launch a Java applet that would give real-time video (and audio, though of questionable quality). Sometimes starting the Java applet crashed the camera, however, and made me reboot it.Besides the things i mentioned first, there are a couple more bad things:* As far as I can tell, the camera can't actually save video, only images. You can configure how many/how often, but this still caught me off guard that I could only get a folder full of JPEGs.* Reset button is very hard to press (paper clip was too big; I needed to use SIM card tool), and WPS button is very easy to press. I suspect most people won't need to reset as much as I did, and WPS wasn't a big deal for me because WiFi didn't work for me on it anyway (though I'd rather set it up manually in any case), but I did accidentally press it a few times.The camera itself is fairly lightweight, and the base should mount (bring your own adhesive or whatnot) to flat surfaces if you want. You can manually move the camera a bit on the stand, but there is no pan or tilt functionality in the software.This camera could at least be decent if it worked better--the feature set isn't bad, and the hardware, while light, feels good. Importantly, image quality was also good enough for security purposes as far as I was able to tell.

While D-Link may consider it a replacement, it is inferior in very important ways.First, it is significantly lighter; the construction is all light plastic (including the base) so it is not as stable sitting on a ledge/shelf - The hanging power cord can drag it and if you add an ethernet cable be prepared to secure the camera in place.Next, it is fixed focus.  You can manually adjust the focus on the 920.  With the 930 you get a fixed focus lens similar to the old 110 point-and-shoot cameras.Even with these limitations, I was able to find a use for it.  At least until the third, and most important inferiority happened: The camera died at just under 9 months of use.So, the 930L is functional in some cases.

I am really considering sending the whole thing (I bought several) back because it is unbelievably laborious to have to spend extensive time figuring out what the Java problem du jour is with the mydlink connection. I literally have my java console tracking logs constantly now because of this poor connection with their applet for the cameras. There are also additional quirks like the setup wizard for Mac allows the camera to install with recording of avi vs. mp4 (iPhone especially cannot peruse footage in avi) and a dozen other little things you have to setup. Sometimes a camera just seems to stop connecting and I have to reset it from scratch, meaning that I set all those little things all over again. :( I'm not sure if there is a more Mac friendly camera system out there, but what I can say is, the average Mac user is likely to be pretty frustrated with these products. You have to be very familiar with how to access your Java preferences and have a good knowledge of testing your browsers.

IT guy here.  I could imagine that any brand wireless camera that needs to get married to your wireless access point could present similar problems, or if installing using a wired Ethernet connection, so I'll withhold poor marks to Dlink but this is something they could improve upon.I bought two of these.  The first one is still working after about 6 weeks.  I just had to return the second one because something came loose from inside around the lens area and it caused the picture to have a permanent shadow on the left hand side of the viewing screen.  I tilted the unit sideways and the obstruction seemed to slip out of the way.  Possibly heat from staying on 24x7 caused something to detach, maybe a piece of film?  Strange because the camera was set up in an area that gets no traffic so I know nothing hit it.  I returned it to Radio Shack and sadly, the only one they had to replace it had a nylon mount which connects the camera onto the swivel base.  I can already tell this is not going to reliably hold the camera in place and I wonder why they went from the older mount which was made from either metal or hard plastic with chrome over it to this poor design.  Or, this was the earlier design.  Either way, I will be calling customer support to ask for a sturdier one.Though you could tie into your router and connect to the cameras directly, I went the easy route of creating a \"My Dlink\" account on the Dlink web site and thus the video/audio is streamed there in order to viewed from my iPhone, laptop, remote PC, etc.  I have noticed that sometimes the cameras will mysteriously not show up on my account as active.  This means you can't see the video feed.  Give it an hour or two and it may come back, or it may require a reboot of the camera.  This is frustrating if you are away from home.These are my first wireless IP cameras that I have dealt with.  Note something I missed, and that is that the video is in black and white.  It does the job though and I really don't have any complaints about the resolution.  The infra-red video is impressive, even in total darkness.  I was pleasantly surprised that I could see everything in total darkness.  (I mostly use an iPhone to monitor).I use a Mac Pro which comes with Safari for the web browser.  I gave up trying to update everything, install Active X or Java or whatever else it was that seemed to be a road block to be able to even manage the cameras on Dlink's web site in my \"My Dlink\" account.  I finally ended up downloading Firefox's browser and using this browser for the Dlink monitoring and adjusting settings remotely or from inside the house.The motion detection feature has been useless to me on both cameras.  It's really cool to sit there and use the interface to draw the area of the screen that you want to be monitored for movement but here's what I got on both cameras as a result.  The camera will email you either a 6 second video clip or a still.  I found that even on the least sensitive setting, using an area of the screen that just cannot move, it still falsely detected motion and flooded my inbox with clip after clip after clip.  If you're really bored, this might be cool but if you only want to know when there truly is movement, this will quickly become annoying.The audio is very impressive.  I found that I could hear conversations in the other end of my house.There is a timeout on the My Dlink site that will disconnect you from your session after a certain amount of time.  This means that you must continue to log back in and connect in order to keep seeing the video stream.  Not a problem if all you want to do is check in and see if the kitties are all good but annoying if you want to monitor for a while.I paid $149 at Best Buy and then $139 at Radio shack for the second one.  For what I got, I would much rather have paid around $65-$75 so I'm going to say that I find these a little expensive for what you get and I say this just from cost to benefit standpoint, not in comparing them with other brands and models.I think if I bought a third camera I would be tempted to try another band.  However, I have gotten used to the little iPhone app that requires only two taps to be watching the house from a remote location.  I am sure that you can't get other manufacturer's cameras rounded up with the Dlink cams in the My Dlink app.I probably would not have even written a review but the cheap nylon mount was a disappointment.

There were helpful but there was a major communication barrier and it was often frustrating to understand their english.Once I got it up and running it has been pretty much flawless.  I am able to move the camera from outlet to outlet (it takes about 1 minute to reconnect itself to the internet) and I am ready to view a new room... I only did this for testing purposes... it is now on my shelf in the living room where it will stay.  The picture is good - not excellent but good.  There is an online settings window that has MANY settings you can change around.  I have it set on the highest resolution and it seems to be great.  There are also some complaints with it going to black and white too quickly - this was the case for me as well but I got around that by setting the settings so that 8am-8pm it is day time and 8-8am is night vision - seems to be working out fine :)  when the daylight changes I will have to adjust the times of day, but that is minor and not really necessary since there is a night time mode.I also did not give this camera a 5/5 is because when viewing on ipad/ipod you can only see the feed for 1 minute.  While at my work computer it is fine it can go on all day if I let it (once in a while it does get timed out but its no big deal) but on the ipad every minute you have to hit \"view again\" - is this an annoying feature for me, not really - like I said I just wanted it for a sneak peek into my home, I am not sitting there for hours viewing it but I could see how this could be frustrating for most and thought it was note worthy.Over all I would purchase another one, perhaps to see the kitchen as well, just another angel, but for now the one camera is doing its job and I am a satisfied customer... if I paid $150 I think this review would have been different, but since I didnt spend that much I am giving this a solid 4/5", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Overheating", "Author": "M.

To register your camera with mydlink you have to use the setup CD that comes with the camera. However, the setup program stopped working at some point. It couldn't determine my network settings. So I manually went into the camera settings and set my network information. Get the manual from the setup CD or DLink website to find out how to do this (page 25 if you have wireless). It's easy. While on the DLink website I also noticed that they have an updated setup wizard for download. At the time of this review the file is called \"DCS-932L_wizard_v101_1420.rar\". So I stopped the setup from CD, downloaded the new wizard and started over again. The new wizard found my network info (don't know if this is due to the fact that I manually entered it or if it would have found it anyway). Then it asked me to register a new mydlink account. After I did the program seemed to freeze again. However, checking my email revealed that I had to confirm account registration by clicking on a link in the email. After I did, the program started working again and finished registering my camera to mydlink. You can sign up for a mydlink account before starting the camera setup, confirm registration and then the setup program shouldn't have a problem. You just type in your existing mydlink login info instead of creating a new account.All in all, setup took a lot longer than it should have.

Hope", "ReviewID": "R1DQ45279W12WZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The layout of my condo requires me to go downstairs to answer the door most of the time.  I purchased this camera to allow me to see who is at the door before schlepping down to see who's there.  I also am using it as a simple security system at the front door, as it is the easiest point of entry to my condo.Set-up of the camera, without using the D-Link software, was relatively easy.  I connected it using the included Ethernet cable to one of my switches (to note, my home network consists of a D-Link DGL-4300 802.11b/g wireless router and two D-Link DGS-2208 switches).  I was instantly able to pull up the configuration page in Chrome.  I stepped through the Web-based configuration, and everything worked as expected.  I was able to choose WPA2-PSK as my wireless network type, and was able to enter my key (which does have some spaces in it, this becomes important later).  I disconnected the camera from my wired network, and after rebooting the camera came up and connected wirelessly without a hitch.An important note here:  Oddly, this camera appears to use the same MAC address for wired and wireless connections (I don't think this is proper according to the IEEE).  In my case, the MAC address used just happened to NOT be the MAC address listed on the back of the camera nor is it the one listed in the Wireless section of the camera's configuration page.  This became a problem as I was trying to reserve a DHCP IP for the camera on my router.  Eventually I realized it was only using one MAC address, and was able to fix this.I then downloaded the D-Link Android app which, supposedly, requires registration of the camera on something called mydlink.  The only way to register the camera on mydlink is to go through the D-Link camera setup wizard that is included on the disc with the camera.  I downloaded the latest version from D-Link's Web site and gave it a go.  This is where set-up got really bad.It steps you through many of the basic set-up steps that I had already completed all over again.  I set it up as a wireless camera and inputted my PSK for the wireless network once more.  When it got to the part where it was supposed to register with mydlink, it failed saying it could not contact the mydlink servers.  I tried again, resetting the camera, having it plugged in via wired Ethernet, unplugging the camera, etc.  Each time it failed saying it could not contact the mydlink servers.After my first attempt, and after resetting the camera, I noticed it would no longer connect wirelessly.  Looking into the Web-based settings, I found that the D-Link wizard could not handle spaces in the WEP2-PSK key.  It merely had the first word of my key in there!  Another major oversight on the part of the programmers of the wizard software.I went onto D-Link's American Web site looking for a firmware update, but did not find one.  Luckily, I came across a post in a forum referencing the Taiwanese Web-site which actually does have a more recent English language release of the firmware (if Amazon does not strip it, the address for D-Link's Taiwanese download site is [...]).  I updated to this latest firmware and tried to register on mydlink once more, with the exact same result: Failure.I contacted D-Link support via e-mail and got a simple response back basically saying to try it again.  The most frustrating thing about this response was there was no way to reply!  It came from a no-reply e-mail address and stated I had to open a whole new incident with D-Link support to reply.  I ceased pursuing this avenue of support.The mydlink service still does not work, and so far I have given up on it.  I found a free program on the Android market, tinyCam Monitor, that connects to my camera very well so I no longer really miss the mydlink service.  I also wrote a simple Windows 7 desktop gadget that continuously refreshes the view of the camera.I configured a Cerberus FTP server on one of my machines and configured the FTP functionality of the camera to write an image once every 5 seconds to the FTP server.  Every day takes up about 500MB (at the highest resolution setting for the camera which is 640x480).  This functionality works very well.  I also configured e-mail to work with my gmail account and to send me images whenever motion is detected.  This also works very well, with the sole exception that as the camera changes into day mode or night mode, I get two e-mails.  Most days this only happens twice, but some recent rain storms caused this to happen multiple times in the day which deluged my inbox with needless e-mails.I mounted the camera inside my house, looking out through a window.  During the day this provides a wonderful view.  At night, though, the infrared light just bounces off the window and I can't see anything outside.  I have scoured the documentation and support pages at D-Link and have seen no mention about whether or not this camera can be used outside.  I plan on moving it outside, as the area is protected and shouldn't get wet or even direct sunlight, it should be safe.  I am hopeful the image will be better at night if the camera is outside.  This problem (with infrared bouncing off windows) is well known and I expected this behavior, so I cannot hold this against D-Link.Overall, the camera is of good quality and does what I want it to do, and I am already considering purchasing one or two more, especially if the camera does well outside.  Set-up was relatively easy (with the exception of mydlink) for me, considering I did most of it manually using the camera's Web interface.

D-ViewCam has comprehensive recording options.  I don't understand and have not tested the distinction between limiting motion-detection areas in the camera itself (via browser), and limiting in D-ViewCam.  The camera's option breaks the screen up into 25 fixed blocks, any combination which can be selected, and perhaps that reduces network traffic from the camera?  D-ViewCam's allows finer resolution.Nice that the power cord has an L-shaped plug into the camera, which makes the profile more streamlined.  Of course the camera body can be detached from the base, for use in smaller areas.

Although it calls for IE, it's working fine in firefox.Downsides:  went completely dark in a room with good natural light as soon as dusk hit.  I'll add the 932 for low light applications.

Power", "ReviewID": "R3NZQQ8C6EKWLL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The automated set-up worked very well with my Linksys E3000 Router. I was quickly able to set it up to show video anywhere in my house, over the internet, and even on my Android phone, using the Dlink App.It is easy to configure the camera to send e-mails at set times or via motion activation. It is also easy to have to camera send its data to an FTP site.The range and video quality are both very good. The automated software and the mydlink website make it all simple to use. The camera stays connected to the network, and never stops broadcasting.The only task that isn't very easy to set up, is having the video go to a local hard drive. There isn't a quick and easy way to utilize this feature, though having it save a stream of pictures to a local or remote FTP site is very simple and reliable.Overall, I would recommend this camera. Everything you would want a wireless camera for is very simple to set up. I am a complete novice with this setting network devices up, and had no problem.------- Update February 22nd, 2011 ---------I am still very happy with this camera. Since my initial review, I have continued to have very good experiences with it. Here are some more observations:- It reconnects to the network within 20 seconds, if you unplug it and move it to a new spot.- Though it works great over Android, they keep updating the software to make it more and more reliable. The camera always stayed connected to the net, but the phone would sometimes lose the connection. That is no longer a problem.- Also works on iOS products.- I have played with the Motion Detections settings in conjunction with FTP quite a bit recently. The camera is working great, and is highly adjustable in this regard, but the FTP service on my Linksys E3000 was giving me problems. Initially, I thought the camera wasn't working properly, or wasn't adjusting to my settings, but when I switched the FTP to an external site from my router, it is working fine. Either my E3000 isn't working right, or something with my network settings was causing it to intermittently disconnect. Either way, it isn't the camera's fault, because it is now working fine, connected to a remote FTP site. That is better than having it store the images in the house anyway.------ Update July 2011 --------This camera continues to perform very well and gives us a lot of peace of mind. There is occasional crime in our neighborhood, but an alarm system never seemed worth the expense. This camera coupled with our off-site FTP storage gives us confidence that we'd at least be able to give the police a photograph of anyone who commits a crime on our property or in our home.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "D-link DCS-932L", "Author": "Michael R.

I think the video shows just pressing two buttons, and that was not my experience at all.Technical:  My system -Microsoft Internet Explorer 11  -  Windows7  64 bit  -  Dell XPS i7 desktop  -  Linksys Cisco Wireless Router WRT110  -  DCS-942L CameraInstallation Wizard:The major problem I had was after installation of the local software using the wizard, there was no picture when accessed inside the LAN. I spent an hour or so trying to cipher it on my own, then the troubleshooting section was no help at all. I finally had to go back to the d-link site and read very carefully at the bottom of the DCS-942L downloads, where you first download the wizard. There is a note about using microsoft's latest browser [Internet Explorer 11] and a promise they were going to fix this in December of 2013, which apparently they have not. If you are trying to install it fast you may miss this very important note. A rather complex fix in the browser pushing [alt T], and then [shift b] then saving the site as \"compatible.\" Then within minutes I finally had a picture.Firmware and added downloads after the installation:I also had to upload new firmware! The program also uses java script, and one other DLL that must be loaded as an \"add on\" after the camera is accessed inside the LAN, well after setup. So more time for me to get it working then expected from the reviews.Once up, I was very impressed. The SD recording worked great, as did the IR and video motion triggers for recording.Wireless:You have to install from a LAN cable at first, then moving from the initial wired config to the wireless config, required a bit of time also, I suppose because I do not use WEP, but use a mac filter for security on my wireless LAN. I ended up giving the camera a static IP address outside of the DHCP range of my cisco router, and then discovered the internet accessed picture stopped working on the D-Link Site. Solution was to give the static IP address the DNS addresses also, which I did not know right off. Without the DNS addresses, the camera cannot access the internet for remote viewing, although it will work fine locally within your LAN. These DNS addresses can be found in the Windows7 Network setup of your PC, or in the Router.Site Certificate:I should mention also, the \"HTTPS certificate\" is not recognized as valid by Microsoft's Internet Explorer, so every time I access the camera from inside my LAN I first get a screen saying the certificate is not a trusted site, then I have to press on open this site anyway selection. I do not know, as of yet, how to get rid of this annoying screen. The certificate is from TWA I believe Taiwan. There is a certificate generator in the software, but that will be another challenge I suppose. Accessing the camera remotely from the d-link site does not have this problem.Configuration Backup and Reset Problem:After I had all the software fixes in place, and everything working, I copied the configuration file to my PC, and the onboard http management software is great in that respect. Then after I experimented with the setup and messed things up again, it was easy to get back to a working unit quickly by uploading it from the PC, after a reset operation. Download the two pdf manuals for the unit and look at the \"pictures\" to locate the reset button. You have to use a small wire or paperclip end to reach through the tiny hole and press it. I had trouble finding it, and got it confused with the larger square button which is the WEP button, which cost me a few hours of tinkering. The wizard is not clear on this either, you have to look through both pdf documents in the download section.Access:I could then access the camera by it's IP address inside my network from my Windows7 IE explorer 11. Remotely on the internet you access the D-Link site with an account you set up during the initial wizard setup. I did both simultaneously and the delay was about the same. A very slight delay between moving my arm across the camera and the image on the screen.SD Chip:I ordered 32G chips, not sure if they should have been 16G, but they seem to work fine. You use the browser to access the camera from inside your LAN, and you can format the SD, and then monitor and manage it as well. From outside on the internet access to the chips memory storage is rather slow, so I may consider an FTP server down the road. I ran for about 8 hours and then pulled the chip out, inserted in the adapter and then into my PC and the files were all there dated and played fine in mp4 format. So access by date and time is a breeze. This is a real plus for a surveillance system!Comments:For my application, all the software problems had fixes, but they were not all that easy to locate. Likely a better installation wizard, an improvement I would desire for such a good product, with better notes in the Wizard. The troubleshooting section is also lacking for Windows7 application, it only gave me notes for Windows8 I think, and they did not apply to me. A good Wizard would grab the OS from the PC, and then offer all the important notes during the setup phase, or at least at the end of the setup phase, rather then hide them in the wizard download section at the very bottom. Who looks for notes at that phase of the installation?All in all this is a great value for what you get, and if you are network savvy you will have it working as expected, even on a cisco router, with Internet Explorer 11. Not using it with the new D-Link routers, I was a bit worried when I ordered it.I look forwards to working with this camera now as time progresses, but from what I see, the picture quality is pretty nice, and all the advertised functions work great!

The Panasonics are much more configurable by the way in terms of setting up and verifying motion detection. This camera, the DCS-942L had a nice feature where you could draw the sensitive area for motion detection, and a single setting for sensitivity, but no way to verify when it would trigger other than set it up and walk past it, then go check online to see what it got. It tends to get a lot of false triggers at high sensitivity and miss a lot of triggers at lower sensitivity. I could not make it work like I expected it to work or as well as the Panasonics do. The SD recording is done pretty well and efficiently, and you can get days of storage, depending on the settings you use. The IR night vision works well and you can get a decent sense of the scene even in total darkness, 30 feet away.Another annoying lack of feature is that there is only one admin account.

Now I couldn't connect wirelessly all from the setup wizard - I had to logon to the mydLink site and finish the wireless setup from there.  I had to delay mounting it on the wall twice because it had to be re-setup.

But I soon ran into an obstacle when following the suggestion to use the router's WSP security capability with the camera.

I sent an inquiry to MyDLink support for an answer but NEVER got a response. I used the WSP approach anyway and my fears were realized -- the camera worked but my computers could no longer connect to the router, and the password needed was not obvious to me.  I reset the camera and my router and started over, this time using WPA security, with me supplying the key (password). I had to reset the network connections of all of my devices, but at least I knew what the password was. After that, the setup process went smoothly and I soon had images available via mydlink.com.

To get around this problem, I had to connect directly to the server within the camera system and set up wireless networking there, but this was an easy thing to do.  I was also able easily to set up motion detection and e-mailing of images.  I plan to use the camera primarily for when we are away from home on longer trips, so I do not use it on a daily basis. However, I did experiment with both daytime and nighttime images and both appear to be good enough to help identify an intruder.Edit: Shortly after I posted the above review, I checked my e-mail and found an alert from MyDLink that the camera had been \"disconnected.\" But it was still plugged in and was warm, and should have been able to communicate wirelessly with the router, which is only a few feet away, but MyDLink could not connect to it.  I will have to investigate this problem after Thanksgiving -- grandkids are arriving today.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "At $70, you get what you pay for but it can be better.", "Author": "Adrian Hernandez", "ReviewID": "RPIEBVIS55B5Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was my first ever web and security cam I have ever purchased so I did not really know what to expect. I purchased the cam for $69.99 so it wasn't too costly to get some security and piece of mind while I am away from home. Setup took longer than expected. To elaborate, ethernet setup was fast and simple but wireless setup was tougher. I installed the set up program to my laptop and when trying to setup wireless, the setup program would not pick up my wifi which meant the camera could not be setup wirelessly.After some tinkering, I left the camera connected via ethernet and went to the advanced settings via the mydlink.com website. Here I was able to enter my wifi router's password and set it up wirelessly.The quality is not HD but it is not bad. I would suggest you youtube some videos regarding this cam so you know what to expect. When I am home on my laptop and same wifi as the camera, the picture is great and there is hardly and lag. When I access the camera via the \"mydlink Lite\" app on my iphone5 and on AT&T; LTE, the framerate suffers. Also, I seem to have a clearer picture when night vision is on during most of the day rather than the normal day setting.One of my biggest pros and cons about the camera is the motion sensor and the email notification settings. I love that it has motion sensor abilities so it can alert me of an intruder. I hate that the motion sensor cannot be scheduled for certain times. It would be great if I can have the motion sensor be active while I am away and turn off when I get home but that is currently not an option. Instead I have to be careful when I get home not to step into a motion sensor area (that you get to choose via the advanced settings) or else it would automatically send me tons of emails and notification alerts.Overall, the camera does what it is supposed to do. While the picture may not be HD and the frame rate suffers depending on your connection, it does provide extra security at a cheap price compared to its competitors.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best value...", "Author": "Turk", "ReviewID": "R1Y4B6TP9O9EL0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a whole slew of these D-Link cameras.

I wanted to set up several cameras to watch different areas in my home when I'm not there. This is a day only, 1-way audio(I can hear what is in the area of the camera but can't talk to anyone there), there is no pan and tilt. It works wirelessly for the signal but yes, you have to have a wire to plug in to a power outlet. You also have to use the provided ethernet cable and connect it to your wireless router to do the initial set up. When I first opened the box, there was a CD that was clearly marked \"begin here\". I put it in the drive on my computer and followed the direction and this little puppy was up and running wirelessly in no time. I could then unplug it and move it room to room and each time it was still communicating wirelessly. If you do unplug it and you want it to have the right time, you do have to rest the new time but that is pretty easy and can be done wirelessly. Since this was my first dlink camera, the set up took me through setting up my mydlink account. This is free and you log in to it to watch your camera when you are away from home. Your computers can be off while your gone but your modem(I'm on DSL) and wireless router need to be working. I set this up to send  6 pictures to my email on any detected motion so I can also see snapshots of things that may have happened when I wasn't watching via the mydlink website. You can also use the Dlink lite free application to watch the video feed on a Kindle HD. Once I was happy with this camera I mounted it on a wall in my home office and it detects anyone that enters the office. This was mounted several months ago and I haven't had to do anything to it. I can watch the office from anywhere at anytime and I can check emailed images to see anything I may have missed. After this camera, I thought I would move up to a day/night, pan and tilt camera and bought a dcs5010L which I have found requires a lot more attention and has a few issues. However the 5010L made me realize how nice this little camera was for the price. I do wish it had the day/night feature but I don't find the pan/tilt that useful on the other camera for my current use. If you just want a simple camera to look at one specific lighted area and to detect motion, this is a good camera. I look at it at as a good camera to start with.

The motion detection with notification to the EMail works fine but I had to adjust the sensitivity to avoid the activation by shadows or the wind.  It sends 6 images, 3 of before and 3 of after the motion was detected but if the subject is moving too fast, the camera will miss it.If you need to record video to a PC or NAS, you need a PC always on and running an additional application.

I have one hanging on a wall and one hanging from the base part at the top of a set of miniblinds looking out a window. By having a curtain over the window and turning off the LED in settings, I do not get any glare from the window itself.To help with mounting, there is a removable ring on the base plate so you can place screws right through the plate.Able to send an email with motion detection. You get 3 frames before detection and 3 frames after. You are able to set a sensitivity level as well as which sections of the image to activate from. You can also do a time out after first detection before it emails again. Something I should have done when my second floor neighbors were moving in. Setting up the email is a chore, you need the various settings. I had issues with setting up my @live address so I made a @gmail one. Settings are easy to find on search engines. You may not want to have your primary email receive the notifications if there will be a lot of detections. Those emails can fill up your inbox pretty fast.Able to ftp to local storage. I got one of those new WD My Cloud 2TB drives. I set up a user for security and a folder for the camera. The settings page for the ftp (and everything else for that matter) are decent but while giving you lots of control, there is a learning curve on the advanced page. To help others: Host: (whatever the ip is for the NAS, 192.168.x.x) Port: 21 (usually), Name / Password: these are whatever your NAS has for access, I initially had these blank but camera was happier with an actual log-in. Path: Here is the one I had issues with. MY path for MY NAS is //Security/FrontCamera where \"Security\" is the user and FrontCamera the directory I made in that user folder. I saw some indications on the dlink forums that the exact method of the paths / or \\ may be interchangeable so if one slash ain't working slash it the other. Options for storage for ftp are:AlwaysSet days and timesMotion (no time out)1,2,3 frames per secondx (your choice) seconds per frameImage Quality is decent for what I paid. HD this is not. However, in proper lighting I can see well enough to make out faces. At night time I have some interference in the signal shown by horizontal lines. This is probably 60 cycle interference from the fluorescent bulbs in the nearby security lights. There is an option to go between 50 and 60 Hz but I did not see a difference. It is not that big of a issue with my setup.DLink Brand. Now that I have a dlink cloud account for this and am able to view the live feeds through the web on their site and a free android application, I will probably stick to dlink moving forward when I get a IR cam for my driveway.

The cord is pretty short but was able to pass it through a window (and still close it) onto my porch for placement of one of the cameras.

The last two had the same issue, which meant they would not work until new firmware was downloaded.  The process required a phone call to a number listed on a bright orange insert in the instructions.  I was walked through the process by phone.  First, you insert the supplied CD wizard and use it for several steps.  Then you must download a NEW wizard and the new firmware.  You put the firmware on your desktop and unzip it.  Then you put the camera's url into IE, which you found from the first steps before the original wizard crashes (you had better know the url of your router too).  Then you must find the firmware from the desktop and do several steps to download the firmware to the camera.  The DCS-930L must be hard wired into your computer, which also must be hard wired into the internet.  Then you use the new wizard, not the old one.  You also must choose the hard wired option for the camera.  The option for wireless operation in the new wizard does not work.  So you finish up and you have a camera which is hard wired.  To change it wireless, you must go to settings and answer 3 more questions.  You also need the password for your router, after the program finds it.  As for d-link's knowledge pages, I signed up to ask a question but got an e-mail saying you had to \"approved.\"  Forget that...no approval.

Thus far with this great little D-Link camera it was easy to set up, you can monitor your child with your existing smart phones (android and ios), and the picture and audio are much clearer.  The only down side is there is no tilt/pan motor so you have to set it up and be happy with how you have it faced.  You can get the more expensive model but it seems a bit pricey for that.

So I decided to start building a security system.  I must say, after shopping around for several months for security systems and services, this by far is the best and easiest way to go!  My home is all about the internet, so, the decision to go with the wireless N camera was a good choice.  This camera was incredibly easy to set up with the software provided.  While I am a network head, I didn't need to use any brain power at all to get this camera up and running.  The most difficult thing is finding the right place to put the camera!  Once installed, I searched the D-LINK website for the Security Software so that I can record and playback video from my camera on my PC, even set it up to only record when there is motion in front of the camera!  Also, it seems easy to add additional cameras for other areas like the garage, entry way, and more!  Further, I can check on my apartment with video and audio from my Kindle Fire with the D-link app!  So, while I am away, I can check on my place!  Also, I can also go to D-Link's website from any other computer and log in and check that way too ... amazing, and my only initial cost was the camera!The only complaint I have is that the power cord from the wall plug to the camera is only 4 feet long.  So, that means splicing in another wire to get more length to get the camera high enough so its out of the way.  Being an electrician, that's simple, but for others it might not be.  The only other choice would be to mount the camera lower, about halfway up the wall.This was a very good decision and a great way to build up my own security system over time.  Best of all, its professional, and wireless - Living in an apartment never got better!***** this is an update below ******The camera has been working so well, I actually purchased a refurb one from Amazon, and it also worked awesome, and I saved a ton.  For those that are interested, I also have these camera email me when there is motion.  Since I use HOTMAIL, I thought I would post the configuration for them ....Dlink Security Camera - DCS-932LThe camera works with security software from DLINK, but the camera can also email images when there is an even, such as motion.  This is particularly useful when you only have email access and want to check up on your house, or whatever our camera is watching.Dlink Local Camera LoginSetup>EmailSMTP Server Address: smtp.live.comSMTP Server Port: 587 (default of 25 will not work)Sender E-mail Address: ** your email@hotmail.com address **Receiver E-mail Address: ** your email@hotmail.com address **User Name: ** your email@hotmail.com address **Password: ** Your email access password **Use SSL-TLS/STARTTLS  (No)  SSL-TLS  (NO - blank)  STARTTLS  (YES)***** Update 1/15/2014 *****I am now up to four cameras after I purchased a condo and moved out of the apartment.  I still very much like the items.  They are fairly simply to install.  I used to use the full recording software on my PC, but I have since found that letting the cameras email when there is motion is simpler and just as effective.  Further, I have installed battery back up power supplies on all cameras so that if the power goes out, the cameras can still record and email me.  Also, here in Idaho, its gets really cold, and that doesn't seem to affect one camera which I placed under an eve out of the rain overlooking my front door.  Also, I wanted to mention that the camera actually caught someone trying to break into my home about 2 months ago.  The would be burglar gave up when he attempted to enter and noticed by dead bolt locks, but I got some awesome images of him and have forwarded them to the local police which might be helpful in other neighborhood break-ins. The only complain I have is that it would be nice if there was an extension for the power cord available from D-Link.  I did wire my own low voltage power cord extension using speaker wire here on Amazon, but an nice clean extension, from D Link, would not only be profitable for them, but easier for those that don't have wiring experience. Also, there are occasional issues with ActiveX and Java, which are 3rd Party software add ons that are required by D Link to make these cameras 100% functional.  There are work arounds, but again, for those not versed in software work arounds it would be nice to use another platform rather than rely on these other companys.

I bought this camera to watch my dog who hangs out at home while I go to work.  I connect using my iPhone 4.This is actually my second camera.  The first one I bought was a Foscam which could pan, tilt zoom and stuff.  But it required a static IP address and it also made this really weird buzzing noise all day long.  The static IP address was really annoying - besides the fact I had to pay AT&T; DSL an extra $15/month, it was hard to set up (took at least 8 hours on the phone with support people), and would stop working when the internet connection was disrupted.  Finally one day I gave up on AT&T; tech support and bought the D-Link 932.The D-Link doesn't require a static IP address, which saves the monthly $15 and pays for itself in less than a year.  BUT, theres a downside to that which is that you can only watch for a 60 second clip, and then it needs to re-connect.  It also needs a pretty good internet connection on both the camera end and the iphone end, which is only about 60% of the time for me. The other down side is that it doesn't pan or tilt, but oh well.Last but not least is the D-Link setup.  Easy, yes, sort-of.  The first time I tried doing it from a Mac and couldn't get it to work after 2 hours of work.  So I called the D-Link support line which was pretty quick to respond and nice as can be from half way around the world, but they couldn't diagnose the problem.

To be honest, the camera works well, it clicks over to infrared mode in low light automatically, it picks up amazing detail in pitch dark using only 4 LEDS, and I'm happy with the quality.The setup was not quite as easy as the instructions make it out to be, but the instructions also assume your network is simple, right out of the box.  I've very security minded so I don't broadcast my SSID, I filter my MAC addresses, and I have  a complex password so the WPS configuration did not correctly create the connection to the camera. I had to wind up doing the config manually but to me it isn't a big deal. I had to hard-wire it initially to get it to connect but once I got in the camera the setup was pretty easy and it worked right away.Here is my only complaint with the product thus far.  I'm a Mac user so I had to download a separate installer because the OS X software didn't come with it, not a big deal, BUT....in order to view the feed on my Mac, I had to create an account on mydlink.com and I have to log in to see it.  The camera automatically streams out to the internet, so I have to go out to the internet to view a local feed in my house.  Thats right, I have to go out to come back in.  This is a bad practice since the device is local to my network.  The only way to view it locally is to go through the web interface itself.  As one of the other reviewers stated, it sends the traffic in the clear (HTTP) and I'm not keen on the idea of having a live stream of my house, much less my baby, sent over the net unencrypted.  Theres no option to turn off the feed to mydlink so I blocked all outbound communication from the camera on my router to prevent it from broadcasting.  I like the option of seeing the feed remotely, but security is more important to me so I'll setup an account on dyndns and get to it directly if i have to.What they do not tell you is that the app they have for iphone/ipod/ipad does the same thing, forces you to log into mydlink.  You can't view the feed from the web interface on your iphone/ipod/ipad because the devices don't support activex or java, so I had to purchase a 3d party viewer to watch the stream from the local 192.168.x.x address.In conclusion, the camera works fine, does everything I expected of it, but their solution for viewing the feed (at least on a Mac), while convenient, is NOT secure and does not support local viewing natively.

I've now spent a couple of hours trying to get past that step in the process, which without you cannot progress further. The troubleshooting steps say to go into IE and enable every setting under ActiveX (which IE and MS Security Essentials complain bitterly about). This had no effect. Next, I checked my AV settings (MS Security Essentials) and as far as I can tell, it is not blocking ActiveX controls. I am also running with admin privs so that's not the issue. Beyond that, there is no handy error message to Google, nothing. And, the wizard won't let you get any further. I downloaded the install CD from the support site thinking it might be out of date but the download behaved no differently.Separately, I downloaded the D-Cam software and tried to give that a go. The \"Main Console\" software can find the camera but says it cannot connect to it with no explanation given. The camera and the PC are sitting on the same desktop switch. The Main Console software itself it not very useful and takes over the entire desktop -- really bad behavior.What did work:The only way I can access the camera is to go into Windows Explorer, click on Network and then double-click on the camera there. It took some Googling to find that the default username is \"admin\" and the password is blank (later found this in the manual on page 19). With this, I get a webpage that shows the live camera feed. This page is able to run an ActiveX control but no idea if this is the same ActiveX control needed and not installed by the install CD. There's also an option to run a Java applet but this fails because the page it tries to run is \"not trusted\" by IE. The same error happens with the Motion Detection setup page. The page \"home.htm\" is not from a trusted publisher and the control in that page doesn't run. In addition to the live feed, the webpage allows the camera can be configured with user accounts and a password. All kinds of network settings can be made in here as well, like DDNS (for letting the outside world see the camera). I suspect this is what the install wizard would have walked through so it seems I am not missing much by not being able to use the supplied software. The feature set here is very rich and the UI is nice.As for the camera itself, it is very small and lightweight which, while nice, causes an issue once the network cable is attached. Because the cable attaches at the top, it becomes top heavy and difficult to position without it twisting to the whim of the cable or falling over. This can be remedied with a permanent install via the supplied screws but for now I have it propped up with a book until I figure out where it will go. For now, while testing it out, it's looking out into the backyard. Maybe it will spot the flock of turkeys that like to come around or maybe even a moose.The wireless N feature works very well. The setup, using the web UI, was very straightforward. It was able to find my access point and connected without an issue once I supplied the shared key. This is a good solution to the top-heavy cable problem above if you have a good signal. I notice no difference in video quality between the wired and wireless setups.The video feed, once set to 640x480, very high quality, is very good for a 'net camera. I could definitely make out detail in the feed and it would work very well as a surveillance or baby monitor camera. I have not tried the sound since it's looking out a window the sound would not be very useful. However, as a baby monitor I can see how it would be. I definitely wish we'd had something like this when the kids were babies.I haven't tried using the mydlink website and features yet. I am not sure if I will since the big feature, mobile access, isn't available for Windows Phone 7. They have an app for Android and iPhone. Hopefully, there will be a WP7 app in the future.Eventually, if this proves out to be a decent camera, I plan to install this in my garage, peeking out the transom window above the door for using it as a surveillance camera. If I can get the motion detection features working it would be nice to be able to record who comes and goes and/or setup an alert so even while inside the house we know if someone shows up in the driveway which is difficult to see from the main part of the house.[Update]I now have this camera mounted in the transom window above my garage door and I have a nice view of the driveway. The camera works great during the day but, because of the reflections off the glass, the night mode is unusable. This is not the fault of the camera, but something to consider if you need the night mode. You cannot mount it behind glass since the IR reflects off the glass and all you'll see is glare. At night, while in day mode, if the spotlight comes on I can see the driveway very clearly. This camera really works well in low-light conditions.I tried re-installing the D-Cam software and I was able to get it to work. However, the software does something incredibly annoying that cannot be turned off when it starts up. Everytime it comes up, it puts up a dialog telling me that for better performance I need to separate my OS from my data on to two separate physical drives. There is no way to automatically ignore this dialog box or tell it not to tell me again. Given that nearly 100% of off-the-shelf PC systems are configured with a single disk, why would you do this to your customers, 99% of whom are: 1) not going to know what that means and 2) have no clue how to \"fix\" the issue (non-issue) the software is complaining about. I would also dispute this claim. I have a hard time believing the stream from this camera is going to bottleneck a modern day SATA II or SATA III connection. How is a 70Mb/s connection going to bottleneck a 3Gb/s connection?  Ridiculous. This is just bad design, period, and a completely unnecessary hassle for customers.

We first tried it 12 feet away and it was 40% percent we were find with that because the ftp working completely fine. It uploaded an image every 30 seconds.

It also then showed that the wireless was only at 20 percent. So I moved the wireless access point to 5 feet. It was only 5% percent better. So then I tried direct line of sight and 3 feet away and it only gave the signal strength of 35 percent.So I plugged the camera directly into our ethernet cable and that would solve the wireless issue.

It was replaced and so far the replacement (a 930 model though) has worked fine for a week.Last night the second 932 became unaccessible on site using a local browser address or through Dlinks web address.  The only way to reconnect the camera to local and internet access was to unplug it and plug it in again.  That is not acceptable because it was for a second home six hours away and the purpose of the camera is to have remote viewing and alarms so therefore this camera was sent back as unreliable.  I have ordered two other cameras of a different model (930s) and hope they prove more reliable than the model 932 cameras i purchase.Although the night viewing capability of the 932 seems to work well if viewing inside the house, you cannot point the camera out a window and use it.  The glass reflects the infrared led light so the image is not acceptable.  If this camera is to be used for outside viewing, the LED has to be turned off and the camera mounted tight to the glass to avoid glare.  Therefore, the model 930 would be a better choice for outside viewing through glass which is my application.  I am very impressed with the free Dlink viewing over the internet and the ability to change settings on the camera remotely as well.  I love viewing my vacation home using my Android tablet or any PC with internet access.  Dlink has an Android application I installed on my tablet and it works great.I will say the cameras are not as wide angled as the older Logitech WiLife cameras I have used for the last 4 years nor is their low light viewing as good.  However, they do not require a computer to be running as the older wilife cameras do and a re way cheaper than the new Logitech Alert cameras which look to be very nice, but too expensive for me from my simple needs.So now I will have to wait and see if the 930 models stay up and running or not and if they do, I will be a happy camper.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great product for this price", "Author": "C.

In the dark, the images were shades of grey, but in brighter conditions, the colour returned. Four LED lights lit up whenever the night vision was activated (could be an issue if you wanted to place it somewhere discrete).On the down side, the camera has to be plugged into an electrical socket to work, and the cord it came with is very short. This means you have to either place it near an electrical outlet or use an extension cord. This would obviously have limitations on where you can place it. It also has to be connected to your home network whether wired or wireless.While in theory it could be used as a security camera, it has to be powered 24/7, so if you live in a country or area prone to an uneven power supply which could damage sensitive equipment, then you may want to consider that before getting it or you may need to install additional equipment such as line conditioners/UPS to protect your equipment.The sound is not very good. In fact, after a few hours use it started to make a clicking sound in an endless loop.Recommended for limited applications such as keeping an eye on kids (or pets, or pesky guests), or when you're avoiding (hiding from) certain people who come calling at your gate, but not as a dedicated security system.Amanda Richards, June 29, 2011", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great bargain....", "Author": "Radbadad \"Former Fitness Freak\"", "ReviewID": "RJN0IBDE4ACD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "$70 for this camera is a miracle, but the miracle does have flaws.On the big thumbs up side: D-link gives the user a free web account for \"Mydlink\" which allows access to the camera from anywhere via a web browser and Internet access.

Live video can be monitored from the password protected mydlink website.  The camera also includes software that expert users can set up to use the camera as a motion detector, with the capability of selecting from various zones for motion detection.I was most impressed by image quality picked up by the infrared sensor for nighttime surveillance--images are black and white, but quite clear.  Daylight images are in color, clear enough to use for video surveillance, but certainly not as clear as depicted on the mydlink website.  We found that the sound quality depends on the strength of the wireless signal.  When the wireless signal is good, the sound is quite good, but if there is interference with the signal, the sound can be overshadowed by buzz or hum.  When the camera is in operation, a green LED blinks on the front of the camera, just below the lens.  This blinking light can be turned off; however, we found it useful for monitoring whether the camera was online, since we installed the camera at the very limit of its range from our router.Installation of the camera was a difficult and frustrating battle.  The manufacturer's website claims \"mydlink products remove the learning curve that is typically associated with today's high-tech devices because they are truly Plug-and-Play compatible with zero or extremely easy configuration.\"  I had to go through the installation wizard multiple times to get the software installed and the camera online.  The first 5 times through the wizard, nothing happened.  Eventually, the software linked to the mydlink website.  The next time through the wizard, the camera connected to the website but required new installations of Java and another time through the wizard before it would work.  In addition, to monitoring the camera through the mydlink website, users can set up the camera for advanced functions with the included d-cam software.  While running the d-cam software in Windows XP, my computer blue-screened several times--the first time in years, so I gave up fighting with the software and resigned to using only the mydlink website.  The website claims \"mydlink provides you easy and straightforward access to your digital life all from our intuitive, convenient website.\"  In my experience, the website is far from intuitive or convenient, requiring, for instance, users to log-out before they can access support pages.Overall, the camera itself is a very well-built and handy device, but the installation software is not yet up to par, and the support areas on the manufacturer's website are very poorly thought out.  Expert users who are used to building and trouble shooting networks and connectivity will probably have few problems with installation, but ordinary folks may face a lot of frustration or need to call in help in order to get the camera working.We installed the camera in our turkey brooder in our barn so that we could monitor the young poults, to make sure their heat lamp was on, and their food and water supplies were adequate without leaving the house at night.  We found the sound function of the camera very useful for monitoring the health and comfort of the young poults.  And we were quite impressed with how well the camera stood up to constant pecking by the curious birds.  We wanted to make the video stream from the brooder available to friends as a turkey-cam.  Streaming the video off the mydlink site is apparently possible, but not supported by the manufacturer; thus, can only be done by those who are well versed in network connectivity and coding for streaming video.", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "easy setup on Android g-tablet", "Author": "Dragonspeak \"khsdragon\"", "ReviewID": "R3R98PS5BEOW2V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very simple installation from the CD-ROM and account setup on dlink.com .

I had one set up 6 feet away from my router and max signal was 60%. If you are setting up farther than that away from your router forget about the cameras staying connected. To solve the problem of the weak reception from the camera antenna I bought a network range extender and configured it to act as a wireless bridge and hard wired the cameras to it. Now they work like they were intended to but I don't feel I should have had to spend another $65.00 to make them work 15 feet away from my router.Overall the cameras will perform satisfactorily if you can establish a good signal from your router.

Installation of webcam in final monitoring location was best achieved with looking at live image on laptop, so the camera can be setup to the exact angle needed.The bad - the uplink appears to be fast enough when the laptop is connected directly to the wireless-N router, so the speed of wireless between router and camera is fine to see about 0.5-1 sec update images. Once I left the local network it became a different experience, which makes it almost useless to check remotely from computer (maybe cellphone works but could not try). So you log in to the dlink website and it installs the needed Java real-time software (each time by the way) to provide an image from the camera. Even with 100mbps wired connection the image was very slow to update, and many times could not connect despite multiple attempts. Finally tried to login from a different work computer.

Reinstall software every time: Every time I log in, it will reinstall Java Applets. I just don't understand why they cannot use a technology not doing that.3.

I just had to login at a later time to find out everything is O.K. again.5. Unfriendly software: The live video has zoom-in and zoom-out function. But the zoom-in is digital zoom not optical zoom. That is, it is the same resolution but expands one pixel to four pixels. And the \"zoom-in\" is always on the center of the video. You cannot zoom in on different places on the video. With these limitations, zoom-in function is pretty much useless to me.6. Mobile apps (iPhone and Android) have no audio.

And, once you get it working, it works.The minuses of this camera are that the installation process can be fidgity.  On my home computer, where I first installed it, I had trouble getting the network to recognize the camera.  I have a network hub leading from my main router, and it absolutely had to be plugged into the main router to work.  Once I got the hard wired network connection working, it took several attempts to get the wireless recognized.  I tried using the push button set up for the wireless.  Maybe it matters that I have a Linksys router, but the automated setup wouldn't work.  After I set the camera up at home and tested it I took it to my business.At my business I had more problems with the setup.  For some reason, with the network cable attached the camera kept grabbing the same IP address as the point of sale system.  I had to give the point of sale system a fixed IP and exclude it from the DHCP range.  Then I had to set up the camera and go into the desktop local web interface that is accessed from the camera's ip address.  Once I got there I gave the camera a fixed IP for the LAN.  I still had some trouble getting the wireless to work.  I tried using the push button set up.  Again, maybe because my router is a Linksys, it didn't work.  I was able to manually set up the wireless by using the web interface and typing in the password.Once I got it set up it seems to be working pretty well as a way to see into my business when I'm not there.  However, the sound barely works - it cuts in and out - mostly out.  This camera is really intended for uses like monitoring dogs during the day.

Since my initial review, I have continued to have very good experiences with it.  Here are some more observations:- It reconnects to the network within 20 seconds, if you unplug it and move it to a new spot.- Though it works great over Android, they keep updating the software to make it more and more reliable.  The camera always stayed connected to the net, but the phone would sometimes lose the connection.  That is no longer a problem.- Also works on iOS products.- I have played with the Motion Detections settings in conjunction with FTP quite a bit recently.  The camera is working great, and is highly adjustable in this regard, but the FTP service on my Linksys E3000 was giving me problems.  Initially, I thought the camera wasn't working properly, or wasn't adjusting to my settings, but when I switched the FTP to an external site from my router, it is working fine.  Either my E3000 isn't working right, or something with my network settings was causing it to intermittently disconnect.  Either way, it isn't the camera's fault, because it is now working fine, connected to a remote FTP site.  That is better than having it store the images in the house anyway.------ Update July 2011 --------This camera continues to perform very well and gives us a lot of peace of mind.

Or use an external IR lamp/spotlight.  Gino Infrared IR 12 Led Illuminator Board Plate for CCTV Security CCD Camera; or from places like Maplin/Radio Shack.  Some of the lamps have motion detection to save lamp life, others just work all the time. It was suggested that the cheap IR light board you purchase be affixed directly against the window with the camera several inches away. I have found that the screen must be moved out of the way.

Then just fire up your browser and point to the cameras assigned IP. The IP is depends on what you set your router to serve what IPs.Beginners: tough luck. Please ask nearest geek. Its not easy. Its not your fault. This sort of thing is inherently difficult.EDIT - Feb 15, 2013:Telnet: I guess the new firmware 'fixed' that. You can't telnet into the camera anymore.The built-in HTTPD/web server seems to be dying or refusing connections for some reason. Its still sending images via ftp. But it seems that the camera's built-in web server crashes or more likely the internal flash memory is dying. Or something is wrong.

I have multiple other items connected to the routers with no issue. Maybe I got a defective camera but WPS would not work. The router works with my other WPS enabled devices btw. When I eventually got the camera manually setup the camera software would not connect to mydlink. The camera would also go into night vision mode in a well lit room.

If anyone has recommendations it would be greatly appreciated.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good video (except in low light), awful audio in mine, and  be wary of the instructions", "Author": "austin_Larry", "ReviewID": "RKIFUFWHJO864", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a cool gadget and it does work as a surveillance camera over the internet and/or if you have an Iphone with a free Iphone app (no audio on the app). The video is actually good except in low light. It is amazing how basic cameras can produce decent video. However the sound is horrible. I get this buzzing and hissing no matter what room I put it in. And tech support said there was nothing they could do. Keep in mind thought that might be my particular camera or wireless set-up.Which brings me to tech support and setting the camera up to use wirelessly. Do NOT use the instructions. The instructions are going to tell you that you can set up the camera by using the WPS button on your router. At least on mine that wiped out my network settings and made it impossible for computers and phones that had connected before to connect again. My router maker, the highly rated Mediabridge on Amazon, said that every router with a WPS button makes it so that if one device connects that way, they all have to, which is why they don't recommend it. Shame on Dlink for suggesting to use the WPS button when it might mess up people's network settings they use day in day out. That deserves at least a full star off for that alone.So I made multiple calls to tech support. They were always available but not very helpful. But I was able to figure out what to do because I basically figured my only option was to physically connect the camera to my router. You have to manually connect with an Ethernet cable the camera to the back of one of the slots on your router. Then use the Dlink software. This should allow the camera to be found and set up. After you have everything set up and a Mydlink account on the Mydlink page click on camera settings. A new window will open. On that window choose setup and then on the left hand side choose wireless setup. Make sure the SSID has the network name of the network you want to use, if not click site survey and it will look up networks. Then the key to getting it to work not tethered to the router, put in your network password in the Pre-shared key box on the bottom after choosing the correct security you use on your network. Then you should be able to remove the camera from a physical connection to your router and place it where you want. After I did that the camera did take a few minutes to change from red to green, but it does work anywhere now that it has the correct security key.As I mentioned there is an Iphone app. Search for mydlink lite. You have to have already set up your mydlink email and password. Put those in and you can see the video. It does work great but there is no audio, which in my case is fine since the audio scratchiness is unbearable anyway.. It also take surprisingly good pictures and saves them to your camera roll. Tech support kept saying you download the app from our website. And I kept saying that doesn't sound right are you sure the app isn't in the Apple app store? And of course it was in the app store. So it is what it is with their tech support, not impressive. Even with the bad manual and bad tech support I still would have given 4 stars if the audio had been ok. But my audio is unusable. However that might be some quirk with my network connection. But every other job I am asking my router to handle it is doing a superb job. So I either got a lemon audio wise or the audio is a problem. But for a basic surveillance camera, once it is set up it works pretty well. And the Iphone app is a nice fun thing.", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not worth the Headache", "Author": "2012EndGame", "ReviewID": "R3UE1WQ5TL0A41", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Here is my goal:My mother is an older retiree on a fixed income who has experienced fainting episodes lately, and occasionally falls; she also has helpers who we suspect of abuse.  I was looking for an IP camera that I can setup and record and watch what is happening in her house remotely.The Issue:My mother has no high speed Internet no cable, no DSL, only a simple phone line.My Solution:1. Purchase a Verizon, Sprint, Tmobile 3G/4G Hotspot and use that as Internet.2. Purchase an IP Camera like Belkin, Dlink, Dropcam or some other Cloud Based Camera and connect it to the hotpsot for Internet Access.Issues:I would like to share some of the issues I encounter in my project that cost me $$$, 600 Miles round trip and a whole weekend trying to get it to work.You can take this review for what its worth or toss it.  However if I can save you some time, money, and frustration then my review will have served its purpose.Timeline:Thursday 01/24/13 Bought a Tmobile Hotspot since my mother lives in a 4G Coverage area and Tmobile has no Overage over data usage, Unlike Verizon, and AT&T.;Friday 01/25/13 Bought the DLINK Cloud Cam and Belkin Cloud Cam from Frys Electronics, tested both cameras on my home network everything worked fine.Saturday 01/26/13 Made the 3 hour trek to install.  Setup the Cameras to connect via WIFI to the TMobile Hotspot.  Could not view cameras over the network.Issue 1: Cellular Carriers require Static IP Addresses because the Cellular Broadband Network sits behind a NAT firewall, which blocks all users from displaying a public IP address.  Tmobile, Verizon Wireless and AT&T;, US Cellular want $500 for a static IP Address.  Sprint only $3 a month.Issue 2:  The Cameras are constantly streaming to the Internet.  Streaming Data will amount to 60-80 GB a month for just the cameras streaming to the Internet.Saturday 01/26/13 Pack up my equipment and head home for another solution.EUREKA I struck Gold!Sunday 01/27/13 after doing some google searching I found a great little Camera called CloudCam from 3gstore.com, I placed the order.The camera boast that you can be up and running in minutes and can be viewed anywhere remotely.  I order the CloudCam Indoor Wireless IP Camera WHITE Camera.Thursday 01/29/13 I received the CloudCam IP Camera via Fedex from 3gstore.com.  It included a Camera, Ethernet Cable, mounting brackets, CD, and Wireless db gain antenna.  I Plug it into my computer and within 2 Minutes I was able to configure it to my Wireless Network, Once I tested the camera on my home Network and made sure it operated fine.I switched it over to the TMOBILE Hotspot.  What happen next was short of a Miracle.  I was able to view a live feed from the camera to my Android Phone most importantly over a cellular Network with the Camera connected to the TMOBILE wireless Network without a STATIC IP ADDRESS.I wanted to do a more serious test so I placed the Camera in my car and threw the Hotspot into the glove Compartment and had my wife drive around town.  From My android phone I could see her drive around the city LIVE.  I was ecstatic that it worked so well.  A few other perks I like about the Camera is that it has Micro SD Card slot to record to a MicroSD or you can configure it to record to a NAS Storage Device.  It has a built in Microphone, and records at night.1/30/13 Noticed the Camera was sluggish on TMobiles Network, I ended up going to Verizon Wireless Store and picked up a 3GB PrePaid USB Plan for $60.00 and inserted the sim card into a (Pantech UML290) Placed it into a CradlePoint Router CTR35 and set a Ping Target to keep the connection always On.  Downloads and Uploads were sufficient over the LTE Network1/31/13 I pack up the gear and head to my mother's house.  I installed the Gear and right away I opened the CloudCam Android App and they have an Iphone App too and I was able to view instant Live Feed.Peace of Mind:You cant put a price on Peace of Mind.

I thought, based on some reviews here, that I'd have this up and running quickly and easily.  And I was wrong.  VERY wrong.First I tried to do it wirelessly, since that's what I bought the wireless version for.  Another reviewer had issues with an Apple Airport Extreme, but I thought I'd try it anyway.  And no matter how I set it, what encryption or lack thereof, what mode (802.11 a, b, g, n), the setup program just gave the red error that it could not configure the network.  Alright, someone else had problems with Apple, so I pulled out some of my older units I've had in the past.  Started with a simple Linksys 802.11g unit.  Same problem.  Pulled out a 3com wireless router, 802.11g, same thing.  Set for 802.11b, same thing.  Pulled out a Netgear 802.11 b/g unit.  Same thing.  No matter what I tried, it failed setup with their automated process.  Found a different program on the CD that just lets you get at the hardware without setting up the online stuff, so tried that - same thing.  Tried setting things static as opposed to DHCP, same fail.  So I left it wired, and got it on the network that way.  Then I hit the built in admin webpage on the unit itself, set up the wireless on all the units one at a time again, same thing.  So I figured I'll at least see how it works wired.I have a static IP, and opened the ports I set the unit on through the firewall.  From the program or the built in webpage, I could see the output fine, but as others have said the audio was horrible.  Loud hissing even when things were dead silent and there was no noise it was picking up.  Video, while not great quality, at least impressed me with how high the viewing framerate was.  This is my third unit I'm trying, after having problems with the Logitech unit, and the dropcam.  The others weren't as smooth with the video display, just higher quality.  And the night viewing worked pretty well also for the testing I did in my house at night, all lights off.  \"Lit up\" a surprising amount.  So I could watch it locally, time to set it up for the mydlink website and my iPhone.Got the account created fine, but even though the unit was working locally on my network, and even though I could access it directly via IP from outside my network, it took me almost an hour to beat it into submission to join itself to the dlink webservers.  But through their servers, it NEVER showed anything but a black box.  I could still access the video from outside the network directly with a web browser (and was nice that it supports both ActiveX and Java, so worked on both my macs and my PC's) but it never worked through their system.Then I tried the iPhone app.  Again, fail.  Got that set up to use my Dlink account, logged in fine, listed my camera fine, but nothing ever got through video-wise.  Just timed out.Tried to contact Dlink support, no replies.  Even posted on their beta support forums, nothing even from other users in the peer support forums.So it was boxed up and returned.

Let me count the ways:D-Link claims this product has 24/7 tech support, only they have like one person answering the phone. I use computers every day & am a pretty smart guy.

I had to wait over 40 minutes in the queue (even though the timer said it'd only be 25), then had to deal with this nasty woman for another 45 minutes speaking to me as if I was a half-wit. For all that attitude, she still couldn't help me set up the camera using Wi-Fi. OK fine, so maybe that's not her problem, even though I have a new router from a major company.So I'd like to set up some of the other aspects of the camera, including watching the camera live remotely. Only the camera doesn't support Java 7. Java 7 is already a year old & ships on Macs. Nowhere does it say this in the packaging, so now you're forced to deal with the tech support nightmare only to be told \"this is a known problem. Contact Apple & figure it out yourself\"So since I can't use any up-to-date Apple products to adjust or watch the camera, I decided to use the Windows computer at work. What's that? You want it to capture full-color in the daytime and infra-red at night? Ya-no. It's infra-red all of the time or it's color all of the time. Sure there's an automatic button to make it change during different lighting situations, but using it makes the camera infra-red 100% of the time.OK, so now I'd like to set up the motion detection, especially because it's impossible to record constantly. It's such a nice tool! How convenient that it'll send you an email of six frames on either side of the motion detection. Too bad it doesn't work. You can pick a number of regions on the image to get motion (I believe nine) and you can also set up its sensitivity. Cool! So I try it at 100% with half the regions covered. Every air pressure change that shakes my front door sends me another email. I think I deleted a few hundred over the weekend. So I (having to wait until I'm at my work computer) change the settings to 50% sensitivity. Still hundreds of emails. Then I set it to 20%. OK now I'm down to 40 emails per day (of my non-moving front door). The last straw with this hopeless piece of trash was when I have only one region selected at 1% sensitivity. I'M STILL GETTING DOZENS OF EMAlL PER DAY!!!

I bought this not so much for home security, but more for checking up on the pets while I'm gone and watching to see which one is causing the most trouble when I'm not around.  I wanted a camera that had pan/tilt capabilities, but they were either too expensive or too complicated to set up.  So I bought this and have it set up on my mantle in the living room which gives the widest viewing angle of the living room.  I've already read previous reviews as well as their website so I was aware that it would be easy to set up, but was still surprised by the simplicity of it.  It was really just a matter of taking it out of the box, plugging it in, and going to their website.  I also downloaded their free app from the Android Marketplace for both my tablet and phone and the app is very clean and simple to use.  After logging in, it shows you a list of all the cameras you have set up (for now I just have the one in my living room, but I'll probably get a couple more for the kitchen and master bedroom) and after selecting which camera you want to view, it pops up on the screen rather quickly, even when on 3g.  I'm able to easily check on my home when I'm at work, at the park, or anywhere else I can get a cell signal.  I did have some difficulty viewing it on my default browser (Chrome), but that might have to do with the browser still being relatively new.  The picture quality isn't the best, but it's clear enough that I'm still able to tell what's going on.  The colors are pretty washed out, almost completely black and white really, but again this isn't too much of a problem for me.  Also, just like previous reviewers have pointed out, this camera produces a lot of static noise.  Even when everything was turned off in the living room with all the windows closed, there was still a lot of static noise.  I'm not sure how this would affect conversations or low level noises you wanted to listen in on.  The night vision is great; I can clearly see the living room even when it's pitch black.Even with the shortcomings, I think this is a great camera.  The price point is excellent, it's extremely easy to set up, and the night vision is fantastic.  If you can deal with a stationary camera that shows the picture in black and white and static noise, you won't be disappointed.

You need to use the enclosed CD wizard which is slow and frustrating (you'd think in 2010 setting up an N network device would be straight forward!). I ran the wizard with the Camera attached to my TimeCapsule router which is really an Airport extreme with built in hard disk multiple times. It found the Camera and allowed me to assign a password to it. It wouldn't identify the internet access (DHCP) in my case. And the most frustrating point was once it scans for the network and I put my password for WPA security it wouldn't go through. I kept getting an error message with an advice to use an Ethernet connected computer to complete the process. I had to move my router to another room to try to do that and still with the same result. I actually gave up and started repackaging to return to Amazon. But I googled WPS connection to see if I can try it. Luckily I could. WPS is a way for you to connect a wireless device to a secured router without entering a password. Most of the time it gives you one to two minutes to press a WPS button on both the device and the router and they connect to each other without having to enter any information. Airport extreme and from my understanding a lot of other routers while not having a physical button to push do have the capability for WPS from the administrative software for the device (check your router manual or google it) . On the Airport extreme you launch the Airport Utility, select your router, Go to manual setup and from the top menu choose base station and then select add wireless client and Click the WPS  on the camera and then the corresponding software button on Airport Utility and just like magic they connect. I wish I knew this before I wasted more than an hour trying to setup a connection with the Ethernet Cable.Once setup you go on with the CD wizard you setup a mydlink.com account and it works. Once you do that you don't need the CD (or windows for that matter) I setup 2 iphones to check on the Pets bedroom which is why we got the camera.The quality is not that impressive but I got it for surveillance and for that it does what it should.The bottom line it does what it says.

So to get it to work wirelessly I had to go to the Dlink website to upgrade the firm from 1.00 to 1.09.  Also had to download an updated version of the installation wizard so it could locate my router.  One I performed these functions, I was able to get the camera to work with my wireless router.Definitely not a high quality picture...and has everyone has said the sound quality is very poor.  That being said it works quite well for what I need it to do - a pet moniter.  I sometimes have to leave my dog home alone 10-12 hours.  Now from my laptop or Galaxy S4...I can check on him when I need some piece of mind,  I just ordered a second on for my bedroom...as he likes to crash on my bed on occasion.One last point, seems everyone slams the Dlink support hotline.  My experience was really positive.  They answered in about 4 minutes and walked me through the setup process in about 10 minutes.

I went to the My D-Link website, created an account and set up motion detection and email notification.  This is where things started to go really bad.  I started to receive an email every five minutes.  I thought, \"well it is just the motion detection being super sensitive\".  That night, I turned off the ceiling fan and went to bed.  The next morning there were 123 emails in my inbox.  I went back to My D-Link and shut off motion detection and notifications (yes, I did hit save at the bottom of the page).  This did not stop the torrent of emails.  Then I contacted D-Links support and told them what was happening.  No response.  I went back to My D-Link and double checked the settings.  I reset the motion detector window to nothing.  No help.  Finally, I unplugged the device to stop the torrent of email.  I waited for D-Link to respond to my request for help.  Nothing.  After a couple of days, I sent another request detailing all the above.  Nothing.  I plugged it back in to see if the loss of power to the unit had changed anything.

First they wouldn't link up to my wireless network, so I got on the phone to D-Link support, and after over two hours on the phone the best they could do was set it up so it would work on my wireless network but not on the internet.  In other words, I could only access the cameras when my pc was hooked up to the same wireless network that the cameras were on, which is basically useless.  After some more wrangling over the next couple months I finally got the cameras to work properly, in the meantime discovering that the audio quality was so poor as to be virtually useless.  If someone was talking in the room I could only hear a garbled sound with no chance of understanding what was being said, and there was more background hiss than there was actual audio.  An then the firmware upgrades began...I had to upgrade the firmware (the website won't let you view the video until you do), which meant uninstalling the camera and power supply and taking them to the wireless router because it requires wired connections between the camera, router, and PC.  While upgrading seemed to go fairly well, the uninstalling and re-installing took time and effort that I really didn't need to be spending.  Then a week later I tried to access the camera over the net, and ANOTHER firmware upgrade had to be done, which meant going through the entire process all over again.  I'm so disgusted with these cameras that I'm going to just throw them away rather than go through the entire upgrading mess all over again--if I'm going re-install my cameras I'd just as soon do it with new ones from a different manufacturer.  I don't recommend these, especially if you want to hear what's going on the room.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "942L model", "Author": "DaByuBoy", "ReviewID": "R1IZURLBOG9KJT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It does exactly what I wanted it too.  I wanted a camera that would email pictures and video when someone walked by in front of the camera. And I also wanted to be able to watch the live feed when away from home.  It is important to get the email with the file rather then it storing it only locally.  What happens if a burglar spots the camera and smashes it up or takes it with them.  The SD card in the camera or a dvr on a desk somewhere will be useless if they take it or break it. You will at least have the emails with the files that were uploaded right as he walked up to the camera. So far it has worked flawlessly.  It has some very handy features, for example you can set the motion detection area.  Currently I have my camera mounted right above my front door.  I do not want it to send me emails if the bushes in front of the house move in the wind and set off the motion sensor. All you have to do is go the the motion detection setup screen.  It gives you a screen shot of what the camera \"sees\" then you draw on that screen shot any size box or more then one box in the areas you want to monitor for motion.  Then the camera will only record motion that takes place in those defined areas of the view.  It's pretty cool, so I just drew a box over the sidewalk leading straight up to my door and now only when a person walks on the side walk will it trigger the motion detection. While we were away for the holidays I moved the camera inside so we could monitor our dogs and make sure the dog sitter was coming on time, etc.  Plus with the live feed we could check in on them any time. This is when I noticed the only minor draw back.  Compared to our baby monitor camera this camera has a very narrow field of view. This is not a problem when mounted right by the front door but if you want to use it to monitor a very large indoor room you will not get to see as much of that room as you would expect.  The power cord is longer then the one on our baby monitor so that helps you get it up high on the wall so you can kind of get a downward looking view of the room so you can maximize the narrow field of view. All in all I like it very much and will probably get another one. I've logged into the camera on the laptop, phone, and kindle, all with no problems.  Another thing to mention is two way audio, the camera supports two way audio if you use a separate speaker. There is a little headphone jack on the back. I plugged in my computer speakers to that jack when first playing around with it and it does work. It's just odd they didn't put a small built in speaker instead of the jack.  So if you must have two way audio it is possible with an external speaker.  I have only a small 2 gb microsd card in it and the file sizes are so small (even when the setting or on the highest quality) it has plenty of storage room.  In the 10 days we were gone with the dogs setting off the motion sensor many many times a day and recording short video clips of them it barely took up any space.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Often needs to have the power cycled.", "Author": "CBE \"cbe22\"", "ReviewID": "RVMY470FEEWLU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a decent quality camera, but the power needs to be cycled often.

Doesn't seem to be a defective product, as many online users complained about this and no solution could be found.Wish listWould like to have a even wider viewing angle - I put it to a corner of the room, there's a 20-30 degrees blind spot.There's a LED indicator on the front.

The first issue is the apparent lack of filtering in the line from the CMOS sensor. If you google for \"d-link dcs-931 horizontal lines\" you will find lots of reports (and sample images) of some really bad horizontal line noise in everyone's pictures. You'll also find a writeup from an electronics tech that opened his camera and discovered that D-LINK's poor design left out a filter capacitor several revisions ago and hasn't resolved the issue since. The technician added a cap to his (voiding his warranty) and it cleared the image right up. I'm not interested in having to modify all my cameras to be right, so, it's on its way back.The next issue is the day/night sensitivity. The camera can be placed in always-day or always-night mode, but that's silly. The camera can also detect day or night conditions and switch appropriately. The benefit there is that you have color during the day, and only switch to black-and-white at night. However, this camera's sensor is poorly calibrated and it thinks it is night time unless it's in direct sunlight. This makes it nearly useless for anything indoors, even though forcing it to day mode yields a perfectly usable image in fairly low light.The final issue is related to the above. This camera has a mechanical IR filter which improves color response during the day time (when the camera thinks it's daytime). However, the filter must be physically moved into and out of position when switching from daytime to night time. On this camera, that results in a loud CLICK sound each time it moves. This is so noisy that I could never put this camera in or near living areas because during the transition from day to night (or, because of the above issue, the transition from direct sun to indirect), the camera makes a click. Sometimes this will click back and forth for a long time until it's finally dark enough to stay dark.Overall, really not impressed by D-LINK's offering here. I have other Foscam cameras already and will continue to expand my system with those.

I use it inside my house, at the front door, aimed on my outside porch.Physically, the product is fine. It seems slightly flimsy at the base though - but acceptable.I set it up by using the wps button on my router to wirelessly connect, and that worked very easily.I especially like the option where I set it up so that anytime it detects motion on my porch, it sends me several pictures of what it detected - sent to my email account.One thing I don't like is that in order to change most settings, you need to do this at a computer - even though there's a phone app. The phone app doesn't let you really customize settings - it just lets you see the camera feed. The problem with the computer is that in certain browsers, I can't seem to access the features. I can't seem to use Chrome or IE; but Firefox seems to work. Logging into your MyDlink web account gives you access to the settings - kind of looks like the settings menu on a typical internet router.One issue is that in order to use the phone app to view the camera feed when you are OUTSIDE of your wifi network, it is required for you to use dynamic dns settings (DDNS). It's not that difficult. There's an option in the settings from the MyDlink web account (you'd have to be inside your wifi network to do this) where you can add in information for DDNS. But first, you'd go to a DDNS provider (I use DynDNS - dyn.com) to obtain a dynamic DNS of your choice (mine is $20 per year). This DNS allows you to have a customized IP address which you would input into the MyDlink web account settings to tell the security camera what your router's IP address is (because IP addresses change from time to time - but your DDNS customized IP address won't change, and will always map onto your router's IP address even when the router's IP Address changes).", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Cloud Camera for the price,", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1TOF8966HPF4B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pro: Price is reasonable at around $35 and camera optical quality is adequate ,Con: Setup was a guided wizard that I had to run 5 times to get it right.

You have to enable Jave or Active X on your browser to view the live video if testing from the GUI.-Power cord is very short.- Unless there was some type of backlight the night Vision really sucked.- The phone apps allows you to view the camera and take a snapshot but that is pretty much all you can do. Unable to configure any setting or update anything from it or record video.Audio was not that great as other have stated.- You can't record actual video unless you us a 3rd party app.Pro- You can setup access to an FTP and the images will get saved to the FTP server.- Camera has Audio.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great day/night network surveilance Camera after fixing screen resolution & email setup problems", "Author": "Dr. M. A. Dixon \"hyper-observant\"", "ReviewID": "R29GEZBKC3ERKD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Since I love new tech, I thought after reading the description on the D-Link Wireless Day/Night Network Surveillance Camera with mydlink-Enabled, DCS-932L (White) that set-up would be a breeze at 15 minutes.  However, 2 aspects went laboriously long.  This D-Link camera had no problem connecting with my NETGEAR AC1600 Dual Band Wi-Fi Gigabit Router (R6250) with the WPS button.  I put the DLink CD in my PC and chose setup wizard.  Everything set up fine except for email setup so I called my IPS provider to make sure I was entering everything correctly which I was.  The DLink customer service voice answering system said there would be at least a 25 minutes wait; as it was evening, I thought I would wait until morning and hope for shorter wait time.The next morning, the DLink Customer Support said wait time would be in excess of 10 minutes and I thought great BUT a CSR did not come on the phone until an hour plus 10 minutes.  The DLink Customer Support thought it would be easier to just avoid using my ISP email and use my gmail account so we set that up in no time.So now it was set up to email me some still-shot frames every time motion was detected.  I also wanted video to record and in order to do that I had to also download from the DLink website a free camera app for this particular model DCS-932L.  After downloading and installing, every time I clicked on Main Console (the name of the D-link video recording app), it gave me an error message to change my screen resolution.  Following the CSRs advice, we switched around my desktop monitor resolution to various settings but none of them would allow the Main Console to load without the screen resolution error message.  He put me on hold many times to consult with others for over an hour but I figured out how to fix it so their software would load and run on my desktop.  Here is how I fixed it.  Right click on Main Console icon.  Click on properties.  Click on Compatibility.  Scroll to the OS you are using and select.  Check Disable display scaling on high DPI settings.  Click Apply.  Click ok.  Open Main Console software without error message.I like having both the still shot frames from the website and the video recorded through the software.  I found both the website and software kind of clunky and not too intuitive, but I now have very good documents that would stand up in a court of law for surveillance on my property at a very reasonable cost.  I love how technology keeps giving us more options at really reasonable prices.I also downloaded the android DLink app which took a little more time than anticipated because when I searched in the Play Store for DLink app which is what Dlink calls it, I got a selection of things to chose from and had to read the descriptions to figure out the right one for me is currently called DLink Lite.  After signing in with my email and password, it was pretty easy to see live feed whenever I want.I would not hesitate to purchase more of these D-Link Wireless Network Surveillance Cameras and the software as well as mydlink website can handle more cameras.  Now that I got these two setup snaffoos behind me, next time will be a breezy 15minutes or less.

I assume the physical product works, but I wouldn't know that for sure. You have to download their latest install program that never gives you the opportunity to register the product. And if it isn't registered, it will not work. And this is a different registration than the normal product registration, you have to register for an account with D-Link as well. The only available avenue for this account registration at this time is the install software, which can not be accessed in the current version.All that aside, the camera and the router apparently have trouble communicating, even when on the same shelf with no obstructions, only 2 feet apart. It ran through the installation no less than 20 times before it finally decided to communicate. The \"support\" links on their web site direct you to product specifications. It takes some digging to locate the install download and the manual. The \"FAQ\" (although I think they left out the most frequently asked question, which would be:\"How can you sleep at night after releasing such an abomination of a product?\", but I digress)has the least helpful questions and even less helpful answers.Finally, the dreaded call. I'm pretty sure they don't want to speak with you because they make the number difficult to locate. When you call, instead of transferring you to the correct line, you have to write down a different number and call it instead. Once you call the allegedly  correct number, pressing \"4\" for cameras directs to another department that doesn't handle cameras. After being bounced around, you have a choice of paying an exorbitant amount for \"premium support\" or going with their plain old \"support\" who are more interested in collecting your personal information than in resolving an issue with their product and software.D-Link is quite obviously a company whose main revenue streams must be toll support and selling personal information.

Second, I'm only trying to follow the simple installation instructions that came with the camera.The software for this device is terrible! I have had nothing but problems trying to load the necessary active x files needed. Modified my Internet Explorer Active X settings as suggested and disabled my Norton's Antivirus to ensure the my Windows 7  or Norton's was not blocking Active X installation. Nothing helped. The camera was ok as the green light was on and as I had a Cat5 direct connection to my modem/wireless router; the router did see the camera in the wired mode. Also, I have an absolutely vanilla network with WPA2 authentication.Issues:1. Went to Dlink's support site and I could not even register this camera. Do not know if this is automatically done when you run the wizard or not; its anybodies guess on that one. Also, the support sites I looked at provided absolutely no other helpful trouble shooting information.2. The Wizard appears to be the only way to create a connection for the camera to my PC. Tech support seems to be nonexistent.3. After several hours of hopeless guess work I got a RMA from Amazon to send the unit back.I hate to give up so I did some last minute research on the internet and found a comment in one of the Lorex users reviews about knowing the IP that was assigned to his camera. OK. so I went back and ran the wizard (after cleaning up any instances of Dlink on my computer)  I hooked my camera by Cat5 to my modem and LOL and behold the wizard worked! I still had no idea if the camera would display anything. Out of frustration I clicked on the internet IP address shown on the last page of the wizard and HEY! got a video browser.It makes me wonder how difficult it would have been for DLink to have put a simple instruction in that last page telling the user how to bring up the internet video browser!I will wait for a while and see if any further problems crop up before sending the unit back to Amazon.

Just hook the power cable on, press and hold the button and the back for 6 seconds, then respond by pressing the WAP button on my wireless router, it's working!!The camera send the video directly to MyDLink and I could view the puppy from everywhere.About quality of the video, as a big fan of HD, it is not very good for this camera. However, the camera is using home wireless network (with limited bandwidth) to transfer data, the video quality is understandable and reasonable. There maybe 1 second of delay (i here my puppy barking and 1 second later, it broadcasts from my speaker).About sound quality, there are a lot of background noise that you can hear, but for my use, it doesn't really matter.Overall, this is a very good wireless webcam to monitor you pet or even baby.

Puzio", "ReviewID": "R3TDHYCVXCKY8Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for an inexpensive, wi-fi enabled, internet enabled, simple camera to monitor my house. I know D-Link tends to be stronger in the home router/switch arena, so I was a little hesitant to get a D-Link camera.The set-up claims to be simple, and perhaps since I'm in the computer networking field, maybe I over-simplified it at times. The interface of the camera itself is pretty basic, but limited as well. Don't the advertisement of offloading video to a NAS device fool you! You need a full-time running computer to receive the video and archive it, not just a NAS device. The software that runs on the PC is VERY confusing and frustrating. However, in the camera configuration itself (built-in web page on the device), you can activate motion control and have it sent still-shots to an email address when motion is detected (prior to motion detected and a few shots of the motion). You can also set the motion sensitivity and zones within the camera field of vision.Night-vision works well on the device, and you can set a schedule by day and time when night vision comes on and off.Video quality for both day-time and night-vision is basic, 640x480 max resolution. Not terrific, but good enough.The device supports sound, which you can hear when using the built-in camera web configuration app, or while using the mobile device (remote monitoring) app. You will hear a little static when the room is quiet. Speaking of the mobile device app, that is very quick and convenient for being anywhere and wanting to check on your camera.All in all, the camera does what I need it to do at a basic level. If you need a camera to support constant video recording and/or prosecution evidence, you should look towards a more professional system. To just keep an eye on your house or small office every once in a while with some motion sensors and night-vision, this will do the job.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great device but install & configure was difficult", "Author": "Angel Castillo", "ReviewID": "R3I5Y01SE6DTLY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I now have the device working as I want. I love the mydlink app on iphone as I can see live video of the camera from anywhere I am, plus audio too.I also have set it to automatically email pictures of the viewed area to a special address. I could FTP them too but email is fine for now.So the device is great, but getting it to work properly, specially registering to mydlink was painful. The install CD had trouble with the wireless configuration a few times and them crashed when trying to register to mydlink. I eventually ignore the wireless wizard on the CD and connected to the device's own little web server to set up wireless. After that I went back to the wizard and skipped the wireless setup to register the device to mydlink. I wish there was another way to register devices to mydlink as I was concern the process for registering them from the CD would fail as the wireless setup had. But it didn't so that's good.So for about $60 I have live video from the camera, plus picture every 10 minutes. I'm definitely going to buy more. It's a great tool to have video from the office perimeter before I arrive to make sure it's all ok.However if you don't have networking knowledge I suggest getting a friend who knows so you can set it up for home or office monitoring as you could get frustrated.

I placed it in the front window, and it's small enough to be behind the curtain. It was important the camera had no onboard light, as the reflections would blind the camera at night. During the day, this camera will show anybody approaching and the motion sensor has activated each time. At night, one would need to have a 60 watt bulb in the porch light. It's easy to find a motion detector that screws into the porch light and then accepts standar bulbs (ccfl, etc) so the light wouldn't be on all night.. I found that this camera's field of view isn't as wide as I hoped, so will likely place this where the narrower angle and low light issues are mitigated.Bear in mind, this is a low cost IP camera. It would work GREAT for a baby monitor or places where a very wide field of view isn't required, more than the 90 degrees or so of this one.All in all, I would buy this camera again.

It is a simple and low quality audio and video device with some fairly primitive but effective software.The configuration worked great. It took me about 20 minutes to configure the system to work in wireless mode with my wireless router, another 10 minutes to configure for remote web based viewing and about 20 minutes to set up the scheduled email so I would get several emails per day. I think the reason I was able to configure so quickly is because I had already done this previously with my Panasonic camera and knew all the settings for the incoming and outgoing mail server and wireless setup. If you have all this information in advance it should go quickly.The physical setup was not quite as fast. The unit has no screw down points on the base and since the unit is thin plastic it is very light and will not stand on it's own because even the weight of the power cord is enough to pull it over. I made a wooden base and a simple clamping system with a few screws and washers to pinch the base of the camera to the wood. There is a limited range azimuth and elevation adjustment and that made it easy to point.The software is fairly limited and will only let you set up either scheduled emails or motion sensing but not both at once. My simple Panasonic BLC1 camera is about the same price range can do both and has much more feature rich software with multiple event possibilities so you may want to look into that option.The pictures are fairly low resolution but in this price range I would say perfectly acceptable.The website has always worked fine for remote viewing but will time out after about 10 minutes and you have to log in again. You can change the settings of the camera remotely which I find useful.I tried pulling the plug to see what would happen to the camera and I found that it lost the clock setting so this will present a problem if you are relying on scheduled emails.I have had the unit set up for a month now and the temperature has dropped to -5C (23F) and it is still working well.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "never worked", "Author": "jen", "ReviewID": "R3FG9T6ZB4ZK5T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We bought this camera brand new as a security device as we just moved into a new area tried with both our computers even my moms own and the camera does not work, due to our location we were unable to return so we are out of pocket $95.00 which sucks.

The power adapter plays nice with power strips, it only occupies one position.Installation============I installed it twice for testing and practical purposes. First I installed it with a wireless connection by pressing the button on the camera (blue light blinking on the back) and then adjusting the settings on the router. I don't remember if it was the router button or the router web settings that did it, but it connected, and the light on the back of the camera turned to solid blue.After the installation completes, you are prompted to create a mydlink.com account, so you can remotely monitor the video feed using the mydlink.com website.You can optionally install the desktop software management console from the included disk. On Windows 7 this software wants to completely turn off User Account Control (UAC) and reboot in order to complete the installation. This is an on-going requirement, not just a temporary change for installation. Disabling UAC is not a good idea unless you know what you are doing and why you are doing it.After the initial installation, it wanted to upgrade to the latest firmware. This required a wired (network cable) connection. So I run the installation software again and connected with wired ethernet and the firmware was updated successfully.The default video feed is 320x240 in black and white with audio. If you go in the Advanced Settings, you can change it to 640x480 or 160x120.I only installed this on Windows 7. I did not try any other operating systems.Operation==========The camera heats up within a few minutes. When the camera is facing straight forward (perpendicular to the ground), it can easily tip forward if you hit it from behind, so you may want to make the necessarily adjustments if it is in the way or if there are pets or kids that may bump into it.This seems to work best in smaller rooms with relatively even lightning. Perhaps best suited for apartments or small rooms.The Apps========The free MyDlink app worked successfully on the iPod, Kindle Fire, and Google Play devices (smartphone and tablet). The app basically logs on to your mydlink.com account and picks up the video from there.Mydlink offers a basic app for free (lite app) and a 99c app with presumably more features. Charging for an app for a specialty hardware device that a consumer purchases is a rather cheap thing to do and does not reflect well on the manufacturer of the product. Minus one star for this nickle-diming. By looking at the Google Play stats, under 10,000 people bought the 99c app, so it's not like it is a big money maker they need to protect.", "Date": "October 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "So Far So Good!", "Author": "Susan C.

I went into the advanced settings of the camera configuration where it allowed me to search for my wireless network and input the access key.  I encountered a problem where my network used a 10 character WEP key and the camera insisted on a 13 character key.  The only workaround I could find was to change the security method on the router to WPA instead (which is more secure anyway).  After that, I was able to enter the WPA key in the camera settings and the wireless connection worked like a charm.  Of course I then had to change the wireless key settings on all my devices, but not too big of a deal.  All in all the camera is working exactly the way I wanted it, an easy way to check in on the house while I'm away.

I notice the price has increased almost 10% in just the last month.  Honestly I don't think I would've bought it at the new current price level.  Anyway here's what I've found with this cam so far:PROS:  *Infra-red night vision feature works great..lights up whole room even in total darkness  *Very clear, sharp video.CONS:  *DLINK forces you to rely on their mydlink.com website in order to view the cam.  Often  times their site is slowwwwww, disconnects without reason, or just won't connect at all at random times.  *Audio is HORRIBLE!  Dirty, static-filled sound, sort of like an old vinyl LP that's badly scratched all over the place...it sort of works sometimes, but DLINK clearly didn't give a crap about making the mic and audio sound quality something which reproduces a good clear sound...it truly sucks.  *Installation was NOT as easy as they like to lead you to believe it will be.  I had to call  their tech support for help in order to get it to work.  They stepped me through a few configuration changes and now it works fine, but it certainly wasn't the simple plug-and-play installation I thought it would be based on all their literature.  *I-phone app is TERRIBLE!  Keeps disconnecting after 60 seconds and forces me to reconnect again and again and again...very frustrating & not what I expected for a camera at this price level.BOTTOM LINE:  It's good, but not great.  It will likely do what you need it to do, but at the current higher price level I would seriously suggest looking at the competition.

I already have the 930L and just wanted a decent cam with Night Vision, so I decided why not stick with the same brand of cams. Only problem I had was setting up the wireless for Verizon Fios. The part in the Wireless Setup where you unplug the cam from your router, and it does a 60sec thing to find the cam. Mine kept coming back saying it couldn't be found or something like that, but the cam worked fine when plugged in. What I had to do was go into my router, and delete the 932L from my Network. I then ran the wireless setup again, and it found it in 2sec. I like the night vision it has a range that I can ID anyone walking up the driveway. If you have the cam pointed out a window, the Night Vision works best if you push you cam against it, so the IR isn't blinding it. The blinking light is a good deterent if your using them as security cameras. Anyone thinking of breaking into your home will know that you have a Security System of some kind, and might move on since they don't know what other cams they didn't see. Now I need to find an iPad app to be able to view 2 live cams at once. Don't buy the D-Link+ App unless you only want one Live Cam, and just a pic of your last live image of your others. The 932L has a good image, and a good price.Update: I found the App uCamPro HD that works with a bunch of differen't brand of Cams. It allows you to run multiple live cams at once not just one live, and a still image of another. You have to buy an in app purchase to get the multiple cam function, but the app works great.

I had to go to the website and download drivers which were a beta version. Once I started getting the software setup, the software popped up saying I couldn't use the software and its needs an update. Why didn't they have the most current on the main link on their site?So, once I had the correct install software, the camera was found and I went ahead and then added my dlink account. You'll get an email to verify things before you can go any further. The windows disc may have had the instructions on how to make the cam wireless but, once again, I had to track it down on the website. Something that could have taken 30 minutes to install and configure took me 2 hours to finish. This is in my opinion, because of the lack of proper instructions included with the box. It had a disc and a 2 sided quick install guide that was again for windows only. Once i found the pdf with the instructions to make the cam wireless, it worked flawlessly. I have it setup nice and high and it covers 3 rooms. The cam has an ok wide angle lens so this helped.I easily downloaded the iPhone app and have tried it far from home and the speed was quick. I do have a fast internet connection at home and this i'm sure makes a difference. One issue I did notice is that the cam seems to stay black and white. I think it is because of where i have the cam hidden is slightly dark, so it measures ambient light near itself which would make it think its dark when the actual room isn't. The iPad app is called mydlink+ for $.99. You can use the free iPhone app too but the + version has a horizontal layout and you can view multiple cams at once.The cam Itself very light weight and found that if you don't have it situated correctly, and move the power cord, it will knock over. I did not use the screws to fasten it in place as it will be moved in the near future unless i just buy an additional cam.

Now I am not pushing it with distance here, this camera is only 25 feet from my wireless router.So if you expect to use wireless to connect to your camera and your more than 20 foot away from your router/access point don't bother with theses 930L models (or the 932L which also does have any distance).  My older DSC-920 cameras are about the same size as the newer 930L, but the older 920's have a 3 inch antenna on them where the 930L does not.

I wanted a product that can be managed in a network environment wireless/wired2. Ability to remote access it through smartphone or just an online location3. Capable of capturing images instead of video all the time4. Night vision5. design was pretty nice - I personally don't like the ones with antennas...However, I immediately started realizing it is not a great product as advertised or described.Here are some of the problems I faced (some right off the bat and others through my testing):1. The installation doesn't work - the software on the CD just does not detect the camera.  Without it, you cannot register your product with myDlink.com and access it remotely and through a Smartphone - this was a major reason for me to purchase this product...2. If you open a browser and have multiple tabs with one being the camera's IP address, then if your session expires, trying to access the camera will crash your browser.  You need to always close all tabs, and reopen the browser so it doesn't crash.3. When setting up an email notifications based on motion detection, they do not allow you to control the number of pictures per email... only 1 image/email or 6.  And there is a lag of 4-5 seconds between sets of email, so when I was testing it, I was walking normal speed, so I see myself walking then I disappear from the second set, unless I move slowly and allow it to lag between sets of 6 pictures.4. Motion detection is very sensitive, and it takes a trial-and-error type of setup to adjust to your proper setting that allows just the right amount of activity to trigger screen captures.5. I was never able to test a server setup (FTP feature).6. The camera clicks every once in a while (similar to a shutter in a photography camera) which I think when it switches between nightvision and day time.7. The night vision seems to always be on when in auto mode, even when it is bright outside - resorted to setting up a schedule8. Audio had a lot of static - I tried to turn off the audio but didn't work until I upgraded the FW on it... therefore, audio is not something I can make use of.All that said, I want to provide a few positives:1. Screen captures (despite of what I wrote above) are actually quite decent.  I linked to my gmail account and I was able to receive all the motion detected.2. Once you obtain access to the Camera (through your router's assigned IP) then you are able to control the camera.3. The wireless works fine, and wired works good.4. Night vision is actually pretty good to show details (black and white of couse).I purchased it with a lot of anticipation but the product fell short of my expectations and of what was described about its capabilities.

I shut down IE8, Chrome, Firefox and wait for java to install. Done that? Good, lets watch the camera. Open up Firefox, log into MyDlink and ... no picture because it has to update the camera's firmware. Why couldn't it have done this in setup?

I configured the wireless while it was connected and it didn't work once i unplug the Ethernet from back of the camera. So I popped in the CD, and went through the setup, and same thing, it worked wired, but not wireless. after about 4 or 5 setup runs it worked. Not really sure what happened. I have Fios wireless router, that may have been issue. not sure.The final steps to make it work - i re-started the process, reset the camera from the back (there is a tiny button, hold it with a safety-pin till it goes from green to red and resets it self) Popped the CD, followed the steps. manually went to the ip address of the camera and created the wireless setup there. unplugged it from the router and it power cycle and it worked. I'm not really sure what didn't work earlier and what worked later.- I did sign up for [...] and checked it out and it works.- Also, have it on the iPhone app, $4.99 which is ridicules. It's a tiny picture, can't use the whole screen of the iPhone to view the picture. there may be a way to do it, I haven't found it yet. Also, ATT 3G is very slow, so unless you've got wifi the video is more like blur images. over the wifi, it works good.

With full zoom the cat filled the frame but detail was a little fuzzy. At 40-feet I could see my car in the driveway and down the street. Picture comes up on my computer. I wanted the camera for indoors and I am very happy with the indoor applications. There were some problems and the camera is not perfect so I gave it a 4. I think many of the problems may be specific to my equipment and didn't want to blame the camera.CON:Can't set it up in a window at night because of glass glare and only the detail of the screen is shown. Trouble seeing my yard because my neighbors porch light is visible in the yard and another outside light. Neither are very bright but the sensor thinks there is more light and the yard is all black to the camera. In the yard you can see the tables and fence, etc. Some people just set up the camera with no hassle. My set up was a beast. The first camera was defective and Amazon replaced it in one day. Thank you Amazon. The wireless would not set up and needed the Ethernet cable to the router. (Later it connected to wireless). It defaulted to the next dynamic IP address and it just would not set up with the D-link program. The password would only take 8 characters and I was not willing to change the password to all my computers, phones etc. Only way to configure it was to go into the router, set it up on the default IP address 192.X.X.20 and manually configure the connection. Afterwards the D-link software ran and I could configure the camera. Still can't configure the email in the camera software. The email is if you want it to snap motion and send the picture or pictures to email. The motion is not like a video camera but this could be my Internet or computer. It looks more like a Charlie Chaplin movie with split second delays between frames. If the cat rolls over slowly the slight delay is hardly noticeable. If the cat jumps off the chair, the motion is far more jerky like old films. This could be my Internet connection which is 1500-3000. I also have to unplug the camera when I watch Netflix movies on my ROKU. ROKU just can't get enough bandwidth to run both. The ISP provider said I should get a Static connection instead of Dynamic to end this problem. Static to Dynamic is double the price. Read all the reviews and the D-link forums. Your camera may connect instantly as most of them, but be prepared if it does not. Tech support at D-link was very good once you get past the screener who answers the phone and puts you through the trouble tree questions.

This means you get a no frills type of network cam.For one I never did get the \"My Dlink\" service to work (didn't want to anyway) and did give it a shot, but the software never wanted to recognize my camera. Because of this I set it up the way I was going to anyway which is manually and not using the dlink website at all; that process took a little bit of trial and error simply because they don't really give any instructions on not using their software (fair enough).I use this mostly for watching my dog while at work and bought two and once they are configured they work great for the basic needs im using them for; you can get sound although it won't pick up any subtle noises, it will get things like barking or howling (which I found my dog does apparently when not happy).The image quality is decent also, in a nicely lit room you can get very good detail on the cam and the FPS is pretty good if you have a good signal. I am planning on purchasing more devices to place around the house and possibly outside as these are cheap enough to be useful.

I found it easy to set up, easy to use and easy to access remotely using all the default setup parameters. While the audio quality is lacking in my opinion, it doesn't have much effect on my primary use for this camera, and I keep the audio disabled most of the time anyway.I am using this camera on a Linksys N wireless network, serving both Win XP and Win 7 PCs.  I completed the initial installation, including the MyDlink registration in about 15 minutes, just by following the instructions step by step.  I did set up the camera with a different username and password than I did for the MyDlink.com web account, since it appears that accessing the camera remotely, also reveals network settings.  The MyDlink registration did seem to stall on the last step, but it had completed, and when I closed the last registration window and accessed the site through my confirmation email, my account was active and website functional.The night vision works very well, and while accessing the camera remotely on the weekend during a thunderstorm, I was surprised at how quickly the camera adjusted/recovered from full-sky-illuminating lightning flashes, back to regular night vision. One note on night use is that between the red \"night-lights\" and the green power indicating light, this camera is actually fairly bright and very indiscrete.  If you are using it for security, it will get noticed.  I ended up putting a small piece of tape over the green light once it was set up and in position.  The camera is still noticeable during night-vision usage, but not quite as bright.Daylight or indoor illuminated use is quite good.  Colors are clearly differentiated and movement is pretty smooth for a camera this size.  I am currently using it to monitor my front door through a porch window since someone is usually home, and have found it to be quite convenient in monitoring activity at the front door during day or night hours.  (If you are planning on using this to view out doors through a window at night, there is some reflection from the glass during night viewing, but the closer the camera is to the glass, the less reflection there is.  Tight to the glass, there is no reflection from the 'night lights', and angled slightly, I am getting a very slight halo effect around the edge of the viewscreen.)  Since the camera is easily seen from outside the front door, it may have some deterrent qualities toward suspicious behavior as well.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Easy install with very cool functionality", "Author": "S.

This is my first security camera to install and use.It's very easy to set-up and add to an existing home network.  It takes about 5 minutes to plug in and launch the installation CD to complete the initial set-up.  However, since most home wireless networks utilize internal (private) IP Addresses, if you want the video viewable from outside your home network, it requires additional technical work.  Another reviewer provides detailed information on how to allow the assigned camera IP address to be accessible from *outside* the home network.  Basically, it requires forwarding to the camera's assigned IP address.Coolness factor:1) The camera links to an account you create on mydlink.com where the camera image can be viewed and controlled.2) Additionally, there is a smart phone app (mydlink Lite) so you can view your camera(s) and take snapshots.3) Finally, if motion is detected, you can easily configure the camera to email snapshots when motion is detected.Note - these are provided at no additional cost.Overall, inexpensive, very easy to install (with medium-level wireless technical knowledge), user friendly interfaces, accessible from outside the network.

It's almost impossible to get an internet connection. I can't get it to connect using a computer unless at home, which is completely useless to me. The iPhone app connection is spotty.

One item of note for using the internet to monitor the camera: I heard AT&T; is going to limit monthly usage of bandwidth to 150 GBytes per month for DSL customers. It seems this camera (or probably any other good resolution camera) uses 62 KBytes/S from the Dlink site while streaming. That's 5.4 GBytes/day meaning 24/7 external streaming would use 100% of the monthly DSL bandwidth allowed.

Many other reviewers have gone into detail about them. My main reason for writing a review is to reassure those who are not very knowledgeable that the Customer Technical Support is very helpful. Yes, they are probably in a non-US call center and there may be a limit to the time allowed for help, after purchase. But if you set the camera up soon after receipt, you should be fine. I have called twice so far and both times, (two different operators) were very helpful in getting me to the right spot and having me enter the right settings (even if I had little faith in the beginning). In addition, the manual (on CD) is very thorough and written well. There are other cameras out there with more \"bells and whistles\" for less money, but I will gladly pay a bit more for something that is reliable and offers more helpful human support as well as documentation.", "Date": "February 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "no, no.. please no", "Author": "Eagleyes", "ReviewID": "R1VIACR30R3ZL6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for price, infrared, easy DLink site and FTP uploading.forgeddaboutit.I do not like long story reviews, but read ahead for the problems.This is a look at the dog sleep on the couch where he is not supposed to be cameraor watch your people talk talk talk instead of workTech support spotty.

Initial setup can be a bit tricky if you're trying to use the ftp setup to capture your surveillance videos.  I ended up abandoning the ftp setup and using D-ViewCam which is provided by Dlink which is far easier to use and setup. What always works for me in initial setup is to set up the Webcam as if it were going to be a wired setup and then switch it to wireless setup afterwards via the Webcam setup menus.  The Picture quality is great during the day and of course since this cam does not have night vision you only get a blank screen.  However, you can pickup for example headlights if your cam is pointed towards your driveway entrance. Which can still be very useful info.  We setup these D-Link DCS-930L cams, and Dlink-lite on our cell phones and went on vacation.  The only sore spot we found out is that the Dlink lite apps only let you view cam remotely for only up to 60seconds at a time.  The time for it make a connection via DLink lite takes a long time and several tries.  But once connected provides a glimpse of your home environment from a far and some peace of mind.  But compared to more expensive security solutions , for what it does is hard to beat.  We were gone for a total of 3 days, so I had to setup my pc to run continuously via the power settings to sleep mode off.  The other issue I ran into was an occasional crash in the D-ViewCam software under Windows 7 once a day.  I discovered that I had to upgrade my software D-link software which I did and use the Windows 7 recommended solution via it's automated trouble-shooting which was to allow it to adjust the Windows graphics settings.  But since we were going on vacation, I could not risk this happening again when I was away.  So, I downloaded and used the \"Application Monitor\" to detect if D-ViewCam application was not running and to restart it if needed. Whenever D-ViewCam crashed, a restart of the app always fixed it. If Windows 7 crashed then it always does a auto restart.  So in that case I put the \"Application Monitor\" into the Windows start up and removed the Windows password so that D-ViewCam would always be running.  All these preventive measures worked  So, despite the drawbacks DLink DCS-930L webcam is still a solid buy for the security it provides. One other thing which is a gotcha during setup.  I discovered the hard way that your WIFI modem password must be at least 8 characters long or it will always be rejected by the Dlink link setup software. Despite its drawbacks, the DCS-930L webcam is still a solid buy for the security it provides.  The webcams themselves have been very reliable.

So far we can't find out how to deal with this issue. Second, where we have the device located we have satellite internet access. This all but eliminates the functionality of the unit.

The night vision works well and the sound is better than I expected after reading some of the reviews (my firmware is v1.03 - 5/16/2012).I'm using it as a baby cam and probably the best thing is the app which I can use on my android phone, my Kindle HD and any web browser (via mydlink.com) on my computer (home and work).Regarding installation: there is an install software which seems to take care of most of the behind-the-scenes router and network setup (port forwarding, port 80 etc).  However... I ran into two issues when setting up:1) The bumph say that it supports '802.11b/g/n Wireless with WEP/WPA/WPA2 security'.  It does not support standard WEP.  If you only have WEP encryption on your wireless network, the camera will not connect to your wireless.  I needed to upgrade my wireless security to WPA or WPA2.  Then it worked fine.  I only found this information by accident on the internet and thought it was easier to try than some of the more complex port forwarding issues.  Worked a treat.2) I wanted to use the 'WPS' setup.  This is where you press one button on the camera and one button on your wireless router, they talk and it's done.  After an hour of wasted time I found that the WPS button on my router is a pointless tease with no actual use.  It is there 'for a future update'.  Thanks a lot Verizon FIOS. - this was a red herring and nothing to do with the camera.It could come with a mounting clip of some sort instead of just a base plate to screw into a wall, but overall I am very happy.  The baby cams I looked at in the stores were not as good and twice the price.

Lowmaster", "ReviewID": "R2GHNRXDAEGKYB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Since my Husband is more tech Savvy than me, I had him share his thoughts on this product. Enjoy the review below!I opened the DCS-932L camera and was greeted by the camera, two cables, and a packet with the CD, a quick install guide, a big orange paper on how to contact support, and some GPL, GNU licence papers. There's a minimum amount of paper here, so not a lot to sort through to find what you need.Setup is fairly simple. My wireless router does not have WPS (WiFi Protected Setup) so I just plugged the camera into the router with a CAT-5 cable (included) and into the wall socket power cable (included.) I inserted the CD, and clicked Start. From there I entered in a device password, which is sadly limited to 6-8 characters. This is likely due to the fact it's probably stored on the device itself and there are hardware limitations to encryption. After answering a few simple questions, you are able to make a mydlink.com account. Here, there was also a limitation on the password. I'm not sure what it allows, other than it must be at least 6 characters. I tried to make a 12 character password with all manner of characters. It said it was invalid, with no explanation. I made the password 12 characters of upper and lower case letters, and numbers. This worked. Not as good as I'd like, as it is allowing access to my home, but it's not terrible. It could probably be longer than 12 if I wanted. I can only hope is stored properly in the website (not that I have much hope in that.) Be sure to complete the process after clicking the activate link in your email before trying to access the camera via website. I'm fairly certain you could even skip the mydlink.com account creation and set up the camera to work on your own domain and gain access via the web without needing to trust the mydlink.com site.If your router supports it, the camera also supports WPA-PSK / WPA2-PSK  wifi encryption (and if your router doesn't, get a new one.)Another issue I had was my Firefox browser with NoScript and my Chrome browser blocked access to the camera page from the website for security reasons I wont get into here. It's easily bypassed by going to the direct IP address while on your local network.The site dashboard allows you access to several cameras if you have more than one.The camera itself, and the features, are very nice. It comes mounted on a stand with a wide range of motion and can be mounted on a wall if you wish. We found a suitable location in a room that allows us to see almost the entire room. You can flip and/or mirror the image in the software settings if you need to as well.The microphone is also of good quality, and you can hear what's going on in the room. The night vision auto activates if the light is low enough (or you've pointed the camera down enough that the ceiling light wont reach it.)The software features accessible through the camera page are fantastic. There is motion detection which allows you to select certain regions of the view to watch for motion, while avoiding where (for example) the cat normally walks. You could have it look for an opening door, but not worry about the floor.There's a zoom feature, but it's only a digital zoom, so the quality isn't great when zooming.You can raise or lower the image quality and resolution so if you need the live stream to take up less bandwidth, you can do so, or raise it for high quality images.There are many more options, such as email and FTP access to store images, scheduling to turn the camera on and off automatically, and the ability to link the camera to a web domain name you control.Overall, aside from a few concerns on the passwords, which I am sensitive to because I am a security enthusiast, I think it's a fantastic device. The myriad of options and settings are very nice, and the price is about right for what we got.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wireless did not work", "Author": "Jx", "ReviewID": "R33UUCAPAJ1644", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "For setup, I found that my Firefox and Internet Explorer did not work, but my Chrome did for some reason.

I bought it to test the difference in image quality compared to the Izon View camera I had purchased that had horrible image quality. I'm very pleased not only with the images projected by this camera, but with the features and options for tweaking that are available. Both day and night images from this camera are quite clear and cover a large area. I was amazed at the quality of the night vision video. I didn't expect it to be as clear as it is. The ability to record clips to the SD card, adjust quality, recording length and to tweak the colors really make this very useful. The Izon had none of those features. Dlink's control panel is reminiscent of setting up a router... something they have a long history with.Needless to say, I've returned the Izon View cameras and will be buying another of these.I am a Mac user and had no problem setting this up and getting it running on both my Mac and my iPhone. The myDlink lite app is definitely lite. It works well, but you'll want to do all of your tweaking via the Dlink IP control panel. By the way, I've read comments that state this does not work via Safari, but it works perfectly for me.The only glitch I ran into was in updating the firmware on my device. The myDlink website said it needed a firmware update, but the page did not give very good instructions on how to do so. I realized that there was a separate page that had instructions and once I found that all went smoothly. So if you run into the same issues, just dig around in the Top 5 FAQs area (as of this writing it's the top FAQ) for the instructions.My only complaints about this unit is that it's hard to hide because it's pretty big and at night the LEDs glow red drawing even more attention to it.

I am very versed at working on networks and with network app's and this one was so frustrating that I had to call D-Link for support. The initiation wait time was 10 minutes ( this was on a Tuesday morning at 10:00 AM ) - I was on hold for 58 minutes. Support wanted to REMOTE into my computer to setup the Cam. I told them no way ! Talking about opening up a hole in your network, they are nuts to use remote control for a fix to there mess. I saw a new story this morning that showed a cam that had been hacked and the person was watching and talking to the family's baby. Back to the meat of this review - as I was on hold for this 58 minutes, I had plenty of time to check out the D-Link FAQ database. Here are a few things I found;One of the most asked questions was \" What do I do if the installation disc doesn't run on my computer ? \"Another one was ' How do I get a MyD-Link account ? \" --- A my d-link account is required for this camera to broadcast. It will not work if you don't have a my d-link account - Period. The installation disc that comes with the unit, if it worked, would take you through this process as you setup the unit. Without it you must contact D-Links support to setup this camera ( 58 Minutes on HOLD ). If I had known that this camera wouldn't work without having to be a d-link cloud member, I sure wouldn't have wasted my money on it.There are to many things bad about this unit, including after I set it up with supports help, the firmware was out of date. It has to be updated right out of the box --- come on D-Link, at least update the firmware or toss these units into the trash. That will be the next place these units will be, in our landfills ! They have lowered the price again and again on these units. That should have been a red flag. Trust me, it will be from now on. Don't waste your time or money on this unit. Once I got it working, the cams picture and audio were not even as good as the older webcams that are built in on laptops. The network part of the cam was in and out. I never was able to watch a steady stream. The app that you use with a smart phone is a 'lite\" app.To get the full app it cost you more money !
