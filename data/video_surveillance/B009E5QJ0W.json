However, once I found out that the red led when activated blinks on and off, which no real security camera would do when recording. It makes it look unconvincing and cheap. So if you are looking for a realistic deterrent this is not the camera to get.Suggestion to manufacturer make one that does not blink, advertise it as such and you will sell many more.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$6.50", "Features": "19 Faux Clear LED Lights\nMotion-Detecting Sensor, Red Light Comes on When Sensor is Activated\nUnit Appears to Function as an Actual Security Camera\nNo Wiring Needed, Requires 2 AAA Batteries (not included)\nMeasures 2-1/4\" x 5-3/4\" x 2-3/4\"", "Name": "Mitaki-Japan\u00ae Mock Wireless Security Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41U9XK8BnNL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009E5QJ0W"}}
