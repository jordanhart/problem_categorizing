These cameras are the most realistic \"fake\" dome cameras you can buy. They are weighted perfect after the two AA batteries were added. The LED light on the front is very bright and the mounting of the cameras was a breeze. You can ceiling mount like I did on my ceiling and also flat mount vertically like i did on my garage. Also the included stickers are great to put on the doors leading into the property. I would def. order these again, all my tennants think they are real, and since videosecu is a legit company with a website and real time recording info, noone has to know they are fake.", "Date": "February 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "pretty cool but...", "Author": "I love buying stuff", "ReviewID": "R2DHMZG26ZED9J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the led is too bright and flashes too often.better just leave it on without batteries. real cameras don't have flashing red lights.plus the led drains your batteries really fast. i used lithium ion batteries and they went out within 2 weeks. don't bother changing the batteries. it's a waste of time and is a dead give away that the cameras are fake.other than what i mentioned above, these are really great. i would not recommend it because only i want to have these.", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice quality looking fake cam", "Author": "Anne B", "ReviewID": "R37GNSB8431DXK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Only thing is I had to change to non blinking bulbs... looks more realistic !

I purchased them for my house because so the maid could feel somehow \"checked\". The ONLY problem I have is that the red LED light is way to bright. I was planning to place one camera inside my room and my baby's room and I didn't because of this. I do have some trouble trying to sleep with a red light flashing all over my room. What I did was place one camera inside my closet (where I keep valuable stuff) and the rest of them in different areas outside the rooms such as the living room and TV room. I consider this a great purchase and would definitely recommend these cameras.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredible product!", "Author": "Chad", "ReviewID": "R33U0C4P8W2BPM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been around REAL security cameras/systems for quite some time now...These VideoSecu dummy security cameras are by far the most realistic dummy security cameras I've ever seen!

The second guy sez the bullet cams are easy to grab and break off or turn away. So I'm ordered 5 sets of these dome surveillance dummies. In the future, I could install real ones and mix and match cams to fool the thieves. I already have a loud burglar-fire alarm system so even if these smucks wear masks I've got that covered. Might help if you put up a plain computer-printed note on your front door saying \"Burglar shot dead in this house 4-12-05\". Sure keeps the pesky Mormons away.Oh BTW, the first quoter wanted $5500 for 8 bullet cams system with monitor. The second wanted $5800 for 8 dome cams without monitor. Think I'll stay with the dummies until I find a real reason to put real ones in.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Look so real!", "Author": "Randolph4", "ReviewID": "R24KEQAK1NMVYF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A few months ago we had a rash of daytime breakins in our neighborhood.

You can rotate the inter ball to the point you can see the back and tell that there is no wires runing to it. So if you were gonna use these, you need to make sure they are out of reach.

The batteries don's last long, maybe a week or slightly longer.  The mounting screws provided have small heads which do not grab the groove edges so they don't really hold anything.
