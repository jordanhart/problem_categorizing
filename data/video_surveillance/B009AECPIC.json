I have been using the TLC200 f1.2 for a couple days without any problem. I installed as indicated, but when installing the metal lens ring that came with it, the magnet attached to the metal lens ring instead of the camera lens ring. The sensor would not attach to the camera this way. Without installing the metal lens ring, the sensor could attach to the camera.I plugged in the cable and it did indicate motion on the display when turning on the camera. I presses OK to go to the preview window, then press and held the OK until the screen blanked.Motion in front of the sensor never triggered the camera and the LED did not blink.I am a retired Electronic Engineering Specialist. I do not force any electronics to do what I want, until now. I had a hard time believing this ATM100 did not work. I pushed the jack into the socket much harder than I normally would have. I found that the connection is very tight. The jack went in just a little farther and now, the ATM100 works exactly as it should. Hours of experimenting provided the results I wanted. I recommend this purchase for the TLC200 f1.2.I changed to four stars because it works extremely well.  Manual kept it from being five stars.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Doesn't work very well", "Author": "W.

It does not have the range I would like it to have, but it will do the job.
