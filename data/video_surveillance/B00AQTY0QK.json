I needed to customize motion detection and I really liked the multiple window set-up and that I can set up sensitivity. Good image quality and very helpful team when I had a few questions to ask. Good job y-cam.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works, but not ideal.", "Author": "J. Stimson", "ReviewID": "R1X45H6TEFDNXY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The first unit I received was defective (it rebooted every 2-3 minutes, and sometimes would fail to reconnect to the network).The second unit works pretty reliably.  It is nice to be able to view it in a web browser on either a mobile device or a PC.The camera fails to meet the ideal in the following ways:Occasionally (every 5-10 minutes) the video pauses.  In a browser window, a refresh is required to restart it.  In the dedicated MultiLive PC software, the video restarts automatically.The MultiLive PC software periodically locks up, and will not restart without killing the old process from the Windows task manager.Even at the highest quality setting, the picture is pretty pixelated for a 640x480 image.  Frame rate does not seem to be 30fps as advertised.The audio feed has a constant background tickety-tickety-tickety...The infrared lamps emit visible red light, which makes the camera visible in the dark.Changing any of the night vision settings causes a clicking sound from the camera.  Changing the IR filter setting causes a loud click which attracts attention.Automatic IP setting did not work.  I had to assign the IP address manually.UPDATE: After 3 months of continuous use indoors, the replacement unit started freezing up (not responding to the network) about once a day, recoverable only by disconnecting and reconnecting power.  Y-Cam replaced it under warranty (I paid to ship the bad unit to them).  The new camera has new firmware and I was able to use automatic IP address assignment (DHCP).", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Audio failed after a week", "Author": "Palmer Stephens", "ReviewID": "R1FRC8PRJA7MFQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We have a Y-cam Knight we use to monitor a baby and it worked great for 2 years.
