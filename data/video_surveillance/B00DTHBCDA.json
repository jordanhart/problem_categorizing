{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A decent system at a fair price", "Author": "CH", "ReviewID": "RD72F0HOOJ6VR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The system is basically what I expected... a decent video system. The shortcomings are minor, but present. First, it's nearly impossible to get an external SATA drive to work with this box. I have many, and was unable to get ANY to work. The only way I'm able to get another drive to work is to use an eSATA to SATA cable, connect the SATA end to a bare SATA drive, then power the drive from a separate power supply. This is a shortcoming that must be fixed or many users will be unable to use an external drive at all. Second, the manual claims that the computer software is so good that you can completely configure the unit from a computer connected to your network. The computer software in fact is barely usable at all. It isn't even possible to fast forward when doing a playback! The screen indicates 2X, 4X etc playback, but the video still plugs along at 1X.Finally, the cables provided with the system are 50 ft each. This is fine for a small house or business.... but a small house or business probably doesn't need 8 cameras. For my house, I was able to use 4 of the cameras with the included 50 ft. cables, but for the other 4 I had to buy 100 ft. cables.Concluding, I believe I got good value for what I paid. Video quality is OK... I don't think I need higher resolution. 8 cameras is right for me, and the 1 TB internal drive is enough, but I'll probably increase it to a 2 TB drive eventually because of the problem with getting an external drive to work.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$959.99", "Features": "Swann 960H 9Ch 8 Cam 700TVL 1TB HDD Security Syst", "Name": "Swann 960H 9Ch 8 Cam 700TVL 1TB HDD Security Syst", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31yttVjGKjL.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DTHBCDA"}}
