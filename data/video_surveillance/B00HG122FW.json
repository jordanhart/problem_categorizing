Kellogg", "ReviewID": "R228U29SXBYWLG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Only reason for not having a five star is the mediocre documentation that comes with the camera and a bad software disk.  All issues were handled by a very responsive seller.  We are using the camera on the Synology Surveillance Station and it had no issues recognizing the camera.  The camera is accessed by it's own IP address and software where you can assign its IP address and manipulate the video like flipping the image and quality of the image.", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00HG122FW"}}
