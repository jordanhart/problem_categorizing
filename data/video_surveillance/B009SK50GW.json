{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great for the price", "Author": "Lawrence R. Oleary", "ReviewID": "R3U3W89U61AFU7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been an investigator for over twenty years. This item is great for those legal applications. The quality is not the greatest with the photos and video but you can make out the details fine.I have to say however that customer service was awesome.The first one that I purchased had very poor audio output and quite a bit if hiss in the sound. Very poor.I  contacted Amazon and they took it back and credited me.I contacted the manufacturer and they were right on it to support me. They said that the audio should have been clear.I ordered another one and it works just fine. They were right and quite supportive. I could have also sent it back to them.In some states you can not record audio of someone else or it is a felony however in our state if you are  part of the conversation it is legal. Other than that you need to let someone know that you are recording them.Great if you get pulled over for a ticket or if someone comes to your home to try to scam you. Having this evidence is awesome.Make sure that you set the date and time for accurate evidence.On a final note it can also be used as an external camera for your computer.In closing for the money it is not bad and a great novility for your friends to see themselves after a New Years Eve party.New PostI have to add that I have had and enjoyed this item for several months now and find that the pen does not hold a charge for more than a day.You need to charge it every time you plan on taking it out. It will discharge even if you do not use it.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$61.99", "Features": "Takes pictures, records video, and records and audio\n1.3 Megapixel Camera with 4GB Internal Memory\nPlayback or email files right on your computer\nCan be used as a Webcam\nIncludes 3 ink refills", "Name": "Q-See QP1341  Surveillance Pen (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31G8c6PcALL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009SK50GW"}}
